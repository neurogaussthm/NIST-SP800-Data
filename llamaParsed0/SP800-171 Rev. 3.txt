# Abstract
The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is of paramount importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal Government to successfully conduct its essential missions and functions. This publication provides federal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations. The requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations. This publication can be used in conjunction with its companion publication, NIST Special Publication 800-171A, which provides a comprehensive set of procedures to assess the security requirements.

# 1. Introduction
Executive Order (EO) 13556 established a government-wide program to standardize the way the executive branch handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). EO 13556 required that the CUI program emphasize openness, transparency, and uniformity of government-wide practices and that the program implementation take place in a manner consistent with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and guidelines. As the CUI program Executive Agent, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides information, guidance, policy, and requirements on handling CUI. This includes approved CUI categories and descriptions, the basis for safeguarding and dissemination controls, and procedures for the use of CUI. The CUI federal regulation provides guidance to federal agencies on the designation, safeguarding, marking, dissemination, decontrolling, and disposition of CUI; establishes self-inspection and oversight requirements; and delineates other facets of the program.

The CUI regulation requires federal agencies that use federal information systems to process, store, or transmit CUI to comply with NIST standards and guidelines. The responsibility of federal agencies to protect CUI does not change when such information is shared with nonfederal organizations. Therefore, a similar level of protection is needed when CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted by nonfederal organizations using nonfederal systems. To maintain a consistent level of protection, the security requirements for safeguarding CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations must comply with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 199) publication and FIPS 200. The requirements are derived from the controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53.

## 1.1. Purpose and Applicability# Recommended Security Requirements for Protecting CUI

This publication provides federal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) when such information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations. These requirements apply in situations where there are no specific safeguarding requirements prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or government-wide policy for the CUI category listed in the CUI registry.

## Scope of the Requirements

The requirements do not apply to nonfederal organizations that are collecting or maintaining information on behalf of a federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf of an agency. The security requirements in this publication are only applicable to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components.

The requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations. Appropriately scoping requirements is an important factor in determining protection-related investment decisions and managing security risks for nonfederal organizations.

If nonfederal organizations designate system components for the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI, those organizations may limit the scope of the security requirements by isolating the system components in a separate security domain. Isolation can be achieved by applying architectural and design concepts (e.g., implementing subnetworks with firewalls or other boundary protection devices and using information flow control mechanisms). Security domains may employ physical separation, logical separation, or a combination of both. This approach can provide adequate security for CUI and avoid increasing the organization’s security posture beyond what it requires for protecting its missions, operations, and assets.

## 1.2 Organization of This Publication

The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:

- **Section 2**: Describes the assumptions and methodology used to develop the security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI, the format of the requirements, and the tailoring criteria applied to the NIST guidelines to obtain the requirements.
- **Section 3**: Lists the security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations.

The following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI:

- **References**
- **Appendix A**: Acronyms
- **Appendix B**: Glossary
- **Appendix C**: Tailoring Criteria
- **Appendix D**: Organization-Defined Parameters
- **Appendix E**: Change Log

## 2. The Fundamentals

This section describes the assumptions and methodology used to develop the requirements to protect the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. It also includes the tailoring criteria applied to the controls in SP 800-53.# 2.1. Security Requirement Assumptions

The security requirements in this publication are based on the following assumptions:

- Federal information designated as CUI has the same value, whether such information resides in a federal or nonfederal system or organization.
- Statutory and regulatory requirements for the protection of CUI are consistent in federal and nonfederal systems and organizations.
- Safeguards implemented to protect CUI are consistent in federal and nonfederal systems and organizations.
- The confidentiality impact value for CUI is no less than moderate.
- Nonfederal organizations can directly implement a variety of potential security solutions or use external service providers to satisfy security requirements.

# 2.2. Security Requirement Development Methodology

Starting with the SP 800-53 controls in the SP 800-53B moderate baseline, the controls are tailored to eliminate selected controls or parts of controls that are:

- Primarily the responsibility of the Federal Government,
- Not directly related to protecting the confidentiality of CUI,
- Adequately addressed by other related controls, or
- Not applicable.

SP 800-171 security requirements represent a subset of the controls that are necessary to protect the confidentiality of CUI. The security requirements are organized into 17 families, as illustrated in Table 1. Each family contains the requirements related to the general security topic of the family. Certain families from SP 800-53 are not included due to the tailoring criteria.

For example, the PII Processing and Transparency (PT) family is not included because personally identifiable information (PII) is a category of CUI, and therefore, no additional requirements are specified for confidentiality protection. The Program Management (PM) family is not included because it is not associated with any control baseline. Finally, the Contingency Planning (CP) family is not included because it addresses availability.

Organization-defined parameters (ODPs) are included in certain security requirements. ODPs provide flexibility through the use of assignment and selection operations to allow federal agencies and nonfederal organizations to specify values for the designated parameters in the requirements. Assignment and selection operations provide the capability to customize the security requirements based on specific protection needs. The determination of ODP values can be guided and informed by laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidance, or mission and business needs. Once specified, the values for the organization-defined parameters become part of the requirement.

## Organization-Defined Parameters

Organization-defined parameters are an important part of a security requirement specification. ODPs provide both the flexibility and specificity needed by organizations to clearly define their CUI security requirements, given the diverse nature of their missions, business functions, operational environments, and risk tolerance. In addition, ODPs support consistent security assessments in...# Determining Security Requirements

## Overview
Determining whether specified security requirements have been satisfied is crucial for federal agencies and nonfederal organizations. If a federal agency or a consortium of agencies does not specify a particular value or range of values for an Organizational Defined Parameter (ODP), nonfederal organizations must assign the value or values to complete the security requirement.

## Discussion Section
A discussion section is included with each requirement. It is derived from the control discussion sections in SP 800-53 and provides additional information to facilitate the implementation and assessment of the requirements.

### Key Points
- The discussion section is informative, not normative.
- It is not intended to extend the scope of a requirement or influence the solutions that organizations may use to satisfy a requirement.
- The use of examples is notional, not exhaustive, and does not reflect the potential options available to organizations.

## References Section
A references section provides:
- The source controls from SP 800-53.
- A list of NIST Special Publications with additional information on the topic described in the security requirement.

## Example of a Security Requirement
### 03.13.11 Cryptographic Protection
**Requirement:** Implement the following types of cryptography when used to protect the confidentiality of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): [Assignment: organization-defined types of cryptography].

#### Discussion
Cryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. FIPS-validated cryptography is recommended for the protection of CUI.

## Definition of Organization
The term "organization" is used in many security requirements, and its meaning depends on context. For example, in a security requirement with an ODP, an organization can refer to either the federal agency or the nonfederal organization establishing the parameter values for the requirement.

## Appendix C
Appendix C describes the security control tailoring criteria used to develop the security requirements and the results of the tailoring process. The appendix provides a list of controls from SP 800-53 that support the requirements and the controls that have been eliminated from the moderate baseline in accordance with the tailoring criteria.

## Assessing Security Requirements
SP 800-171A [84] provides a set of procedures to assess the security requirements described in this publication. The assessment procedures are based on the procedures described in SP 800-53A [57].

## The Security Requirements
This section describes 17 families of security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. When used in the context of the requirements in Section 3, the term "system" is defined to be nonfederal systems or system components that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such systems.# Security Requirements for CUI Protection

## Overview
Not all security requirements mention Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) explicitly. However, the requirements are included because they directly affect the protection of CUI during processing, while in storage, and when in transmission between different locations.

Some systems, including specialized systems (e.g., industrial/process control systems, medical devices, computer numerical control machines), may have limitations on the application of certain security requirements. To accommodate such issues, the system security plan—as reflected in requirement 03.15.02—is used to describe any enduring exceptions to the security requirements. Individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies are managed through plans of action and milestones, as reflected in requirement 03.12.02.

## Scope and Applicability of Security Requirements
The security requirements in this section are only applicable to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components.

### 3.1 Access Control

#### 03.01.01 Account Management
1. Define the types of system accounts allowed and prohibited.
2. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove system accounts in accordance with policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria.
3. Specify:
- Authorized users of the system,
- Group and role membership, and
- Access authorizations (i.e., privileges) for each account.
4. Authorize access to the system based on:
- A valid access authorization and
- Intended system usage.
5. Monitor the use of system accounts.
6. Disable system accounts when:
- The accounts have expired,
- The accounts have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period],
- The accounts are no longer associated with a user or individual,
- The accounts are in violation of organizational policy, or
- Significant risks associated with individuals are discovered.
7. Notify account managers and designated personnel or roles within:
- [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when accounts are no longer required.
- [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when users are terminated or transferred.
- [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when system usage or the need-to-know changes for an individual.
8. Require that users log out of the system after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of expected inactivity or when [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances].

### Discussion
This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in 03.01.02. System account types include individual, group, temporary, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, and service. Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by personnel responsible.# Access Control Policies

## Types of Accounts
Organizations may prohibit certain types of accounts due to increased risk, including:
- Group accounts
- Emergency accounts
- Guest accounts
- Anonymous accounts
- Temporary accounts

## Defining Access Privileges
Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by:
- Account type
- A combination of both account type and other attributes

### Other Attributes for Authorizing Access
Other attributes required for authorizing access may include:
- Restrictions on the time of day
- Day of the week
- Point of origin

When defining system account attributes, organizations consider:
- System requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance)
- Mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access for travel)

## High-Risk Users
Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom there is reliable evidence indicating:
- Intention to use authorized access to cause harm
- Adversaries may cause harm through them

Close coordination among the following is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk individuals:
- Mission and business owners
- System administrators
- Human resource managers
- Legal staff

### Notification Time Periods
Time periods for the notification of organizational personnel or roles may vary.

## Inactivity Logout
Inactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to log out when expecting inactivity longer than the defined period. Automatic enforcement of inactivity logout is addressed by 03.01.10.

## 03.01.02 Access Enforcement
Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.

### Discussion
Access control policies manage access between:
- Active entities or subjects (i.e., users or system processes acting on behalf of users)
- Passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in organizational systems.

Types of system access include:
- Remote access
- Access to systems communicating through external networks (e.g., the internet)

Access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service levels to provide increased protection for CUI. This acknowledges that the system can host many applications and services in support of mission and business functions. Access control policies are defined in 03.15.01.

## 03.01.03 Information Flow Enforcement
(Additional content may follow here.)# Enforce Approved Authorizations for Controlling the Flow of CUI

## Discussion

Information flow control regulates where Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) can transit within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include:

- Keeping CUI from being transmitted in the clear to the internet.
- Blocking external communications traffic that claims to be sourced from within the organization.
- Restricting requests to the internet that are not from the internal web proxy server.
- Limiting CUI transfers between organizations based on data structures and content.

Transferring CUI between organizations may require an agreement that specifies how the information flow is enforced (see 03.12.05). Transferring CUI between systems that represent different security domains with different security policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems.

Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes:

- Prohibiting CUI transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing information access only).
- Employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows.
- Implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.

Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of CUI between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g., encrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that use rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing keyword searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.

# 03.01.04 Separation of Duties

### a. Identify the duties of individuals requiring separation.

### b. Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

## Discussion

Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and reduces the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes:

- Dividing mission functions and support functions among different individuals or roles.
- Conducting system support functions with different individuals or roles (e.g., quality assurance, configuration management, network security, system management, assessments, and programming).
- Ensuring that personnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions.# Separation of Duty Violations

Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of their systems and system components when developing policies on separation of duties. This requirement is enforced by 03.01.02.

# 03.01.05 Least Privilege

a. Allow only authorized system access for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that is necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.

b. Authorize access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions] and [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant information].

c. Review the privileges assigned to roles or classes of users [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to validate the need for such privileges.

d. Reassign or remove privileges, as necessary.

## Discussion

Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized access for users and system processes. Least privilege is applied to the development, implementation, and operation of the system. Organizations consider creating additional processes, roles, and system accounts to achieve least privilege.

Security functions include establishing system accounts and assigning privileges, installing software, configuring access authorizations, configuring settings for events to be audited, establishing vulnerability scanning parameters, establishing intrusion detection parameters, and managing audit information. Security-relevant information includes threat and vulnerability information, filtering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, security architecture, cryptographic key management information, access control lists, and audit information.

# 03.01.06 Least Privilege – Privileged Accounts

a. Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].

b. Require that users (or roles) with privileged accounts use non-privileged accounts when accessing non-security functions or non-security information.

## Discussion

Privileged accounts refer to accounts that are granted elevated privileges to access resources (including security functions or security-relevant information) that are otherwise restricted for non-privileged accounts. These accounts are typically described as system administrator or super user accounts. For example, a privileged account is often required in order to perform privileged functions such as executing commands that could modify system behavior.

Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles ensures that only those authorized users can access and manipulate security functions or security-relevant information. Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when such access is not needed can limit unauthorized access to and manipulation of security functions or security-relevant information.

### 03.01.07 Least Privilege – Privileged Functions

1. **Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.**
2. **Log the execution of privileged functions.**

#### Discussion

Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks, conducting patching operations, changing system configuration settings, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users do not possess the authorizations to execute privileged functions. Bypassing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

This requirement represents a condition achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in 03.01.01 and privilege enforcement in 03.01.02. The misuse of privileged functions—whether intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts—is a serious and ongoing concern that can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and mitigate risks from advanced persistent threats and insider threats.

### 03.01.08 Unsuccessful Logon Attempts

1. **Enforce a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period].**
2. **Automatically [Selection (one or more): lock the account or node for an [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; lock the account or node until released by an administrator; delay next logon prompt; notify system administrator; take other action] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.**

#### Discussion

Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic system lockouts are in most cases temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time period established by the organization (i.e., using a delay algorithm). Organizations may employ different delay algorithms for different system components based on the capabilities of the respective components.

Responses to unsuccessful system logon attempts may be implemented at the system and application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities (instead of a full lockout), allowing users to only log on from specified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying user profiles, such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC) address.

### 03.01.09 System Use Notification

**Display a system use notification message with privacy and security notices consistent with applicable CUI rules before granting access to the system.**

#### Discussion

System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners. The messages or warning banners are displayed before individuals log in to a system.# System Access and Security Requirements

## 1. System Use Notifications
- System use notifications are required for access via logon interfaces with human users.
- Notifications are not required when human interfaces do not exist.
- Organizations should consider whether a secondary use notification is needed for accessing applications or other system resources after the initial network logon.
- Posters or other printed materials may be used instead of an automated system message.
- This requirement is related to **03.15.03**.

### References

## 2. Device Lock (03.01.10)
### Requirements
a. Prevent access to the system by:
- Initiating a device lock after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity.
- Requiring the user to initiate a device lock before leaving the system unattended.

b. Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.

c. Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image.

### Discussion
- Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent access to the system when users leave the immediate vicinity but do not want to log out.
- Device locks can be implemented at the operating system or application level.
- User-initiated device locking is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action.
- Device locks are not a substitute for logging out of the system (e.g., when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays).
- Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images, such as patterns used with screen savers, solid colors, photographic images, a clock, a battery life indicator, or a blank screen, ensuring that controlled unclassified information is not displayed.

## 3. Session Termination (03.01.11)
### Requirement
- Terminate a user session automatically after [Assignment: organization-defined conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect].

### Discussion
- This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions, as opposed to the termination of network connections associated with communications sessions (i.e., disconnecting from the network) as outlined in **03.13.09**.
- A logical session is initiated whenever a user (or processes acting on behalf of a user) accesses a system.
- Logical sessions can be terminated without terminating network sessions.
- Session termination ends all system processes associated with a user’s logical session except those processes created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.
- Conditions or trigger events that require automatic session termination can be defined by the organization.# Remote Access and Security Guidelines

## 03.01.12 Remote Access

### Requirements
1. Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for each type of allowable remote system access.
2. Authorize each type of remote system access prior to establishing such connections.
3. Route remote access to the system through authorized and managed access control points.
4. Authorize the remote execution of privileged commands and remote access to security-relevant information.

### Discussion
Remote access refers to access to systems (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external networks, such as the internet. Monitoring and controlling remote access methods allows organizations to detect attacks and ensure compliance with remote access policies. Routing remote access through managed access control points enhances explicit control over such connections and reduces susceptibility to unauthorized access to the system, which could result in the unauthorized disclosure of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

Remote access to the system represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and its susceptibility to threats by adversaries.

- A **privileged command** is a human-initiated command executed on a system that involves the control, monitoring, or administration of the system, including security functions and security-relevant information.
- **Security-relevant information** is information that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of code and data.

Privileged commands give individuals the ability to execute sensitive, security-critical, or security-relevant system functions.

### Requirements
1. Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for each type of wireless access to the system.
2. Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to establishing such connections.
3. Disable, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities prior to issuance and deployment.# Wireless Access Protection

## Protect wireless access to the system using authentication and encryption.

### Discussion
Wireless networking capabilities represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Establishing usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for wireless access to the system provides criteria to support access authorization decisions. These restrictions and requirements reduce susceptibility to unauthorized system access through wireless technologies.

Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide credential protection and mutual authentication. Organizations authenticate individuals and devices to protect wireless access to the system. Special attention is given to the variety of devices with potential wireless access to the system, including small form factor mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, smartwatches).

Wireless networking capabilities that are embedded within system components represent a potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Strong authentication of users and devices, strong encryption, and disabling wireless capabilities that are not needed for essential mission or business functions can reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.

# Access Control for Mobile Devices

## 03.01.18

### a. Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for mobile devices.
### b. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to the system.
### c. Implement full-device or container-based encryption to protect the confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices.

### Discussion
A mobile device is a computing device with a small form factor such that it can be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable, or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may include on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, voice communication capabilities, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smartphones, smartwatches, and tablets.

Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capabilities of mobile devices may be comparable to or a subset of notebook or desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Some organizations may consider notebook computers to be mobile devices.

The protection and control of mobile devices are behavior- or policy-based and require users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which the organization provides physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting CUI.

Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementing mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, and updating virus protection software.# Scanning for Critical Software Updates and Patches

## Overview
Conducting operating system and possibly other software integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware. On mobile devices, secure containers provide software-based data isolation designed to segment enterprise applications and information from personal apps and data. Containers may present multiple user interfaces, one of the most common being a mobile application that acts as a portal to a suite of business productivity apps, such as email, contacts, and calendar. Organizations can employ full-device encryption or container-based encryption to protect the confidentiality of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) on mobile devices.

- [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements].

### c. Conditions for Authorized Use
Permit authorized individuals to use external systems to access the organizational system or to process, store, or transmit CUI only after:
1. Verifying that the security requirements on the external systems as specified in the organization’s system security plans have been satisfied and
2. Retaining approved system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entities hosting the external systems.

### d. Restrictions on Portable Storage Devices
Restrict the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized individuals on external systems.

## Discussion
External systems are systems that are used by but are not part of the organization. These systems include personally owned systems, system components, or devices; privately owned computing and communication devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; and systems managed by contractors. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or specified types of external systems (e.g., prohibit the use of external systems that are not organizationally owned). Terms and conditions are consistent with the trust relationships established with the entities that own, operate, or maintain external systems and include descriptions of shared responsibilities.

Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to the organizational system and over whom organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals may vary depending on the trust relationships between organizations. Organizations need assurance that external systems satisfy the necessary security requirements so as not to compromise, damage, or harm the system. This requirement is related to 03.16.03.

## 03.02.02 Role-Based Training
### a. Provide role-based security training to organizational personnel:
1. Before authorizing access to the system or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), before performing assigned duties, and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter.
2. When required by system changes or following [Assignment: organization-defined events].

### b. Update role-based training content [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events].

### Discussion
Organizations determine the content and frequency of security training based on the assigned duties, roles, and responsibilities of individuals and the security requirements of the systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide system developers, enterprise architects, security architects, software developers, systems integrators, acquisition/procurement officials, system and network administrators, personnel conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent verification and validation, security assessors, and personnel with access to system-level software with security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned duties.

Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and responsibilities that cover physical, personnel, and technical controls. Such training can include policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined. Organizations also provide the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and supply chain security within the context of organizational information security programs.

### 03.03.01 Event Logging
a. Specify the following event types selected for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-defined event types].

b. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].# Discussion

An event is any observable occurrence in a system, including unlawful or unauthorized system activity. Organizations identify event types for which logging functionality is needed. This includes events that are relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs.

Event types can include:
- Password changes
- The execution of privileged functions
- Failed logons or accesses related to systems
- Administrative privilege usage
- Third-party credential usage

In determining event types that require logging, organizations consider the system monitoring and auditing that are appropriate for each of the security requirements. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related events, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented or cloud-based architectures.

Monitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file access—both successful and unsuccessful—but only activate that capability under specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. The event types that are logged by organizations may change over time. Reviewing and updating the set of logged event types are necessary to ensure that the current set of event types remains relevant.

## 03.03.02 Audit Record Content

a. Include the following content in audit records:
1. What type of event occurred
2. When the event occurred
3. Where the event occurred
4. Source of the event
5. Outcome of the event
6. Identity of the individuals, subjects, objects, or entities associated with the event

b. Provide additional information for audit records as needed.

### Discussion

Audit record content that may be necessary to support the auditing function includes time stamps, source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, file names, and the access control or flow control rules that are invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the system after the event occurred). Detailed information that organizations consider in audit records may include a full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users.

## 1. Retention of Audit Records
- Retain audit records for a time period consistent with the records retention policy.

### Discussion
Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on system functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider additional information in audit records, including the access control or flow control rules invoked and the individual identities of group account users. Organizations may also consider limiting additional audit record information to only information that is explicitly needed for audit requirements.

## 2. Response to Audit Logging Process Failures
### 2.1 Actions to Take
a. Alert organizational personnel or roles within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] in the event of an audit logging process failure.
b. Take the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined additional actions].

### Discussion
Audit logging process failures include software and hardware errors, failures in audit log capturing mechanisms, and reaching or exceeding audit log storage capacity. Response actions include overwriting the oldest audit records, shutting down the system, and stopping the generation of audit records. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for audit logging process failures based on the type of failure, the location of the failure, the severity of the failure, or a combination of such factors. When the audit logging process failure is related to storage, the response is carried out for the audit log storage repository (i.e., the distinct system component where the audit logs are stored), the system on which the audit logs reside, the total audit log storage capacity of the organization (i.e., all audit log storage repositories combined), or all three. Organizations may decide to take no additional actions after alerting designated roles or personnel.

## 3. Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting
### 3.1 Actions to Take
a. Review and analyze system audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] for indications and the potential impact of inappropriate or unusual activity.
b. Report findings to organizational personnel or roles.
c. Analyze and correlate audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide situational awareness.

### Discussion
Audit record review, analysis, and reporting cover information security logging performed by organizations and can include logging that results from the monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, configuration settings, the use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance, system component inventory.# Mobile Device Connection and Audit Records

## Overview
This document discusses various aspects of mobile device connection, equipment delivery and removal, physical access, temperature and humidity, communications at system interfaces, and the use of mobile code. Findings from these activities can be reported to organizational entities such as the incident response team, help desk, and security or privacy offices.

## Audit Record Review and Analysis
If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit records or are unable to conduct such activities, the review or analysis may be carried out by other organizations granted such authority. The scope, frequency, and/or depth of the audit record review, analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to meet organizational needs based on new information received. Correlating audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes helps to ensure that audit records collectively create a more complete view of events.

## Audit Record Reduction and Report Generation (03.03.06)
### Requirements
1. Implement an audit record reduction and report generation capability that supports audit record review, analysis, reporting requirements, and after-the-fact investigations of incidents.
2. Preserve the original content and time ordering of audit records.

### Discussion
Audit records are generated in section 03.03.03. Audit record reduction and report generation occur after audit record generation. Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes it in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts.

Audit record reduction and report generation capabilities do not always come from the same system or organizational entities that conduct auditing activities. An audit record reduction capability can include modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the system can help generate customizable reports. The time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the time stamp in the record is insufficient.

## Time Stamps (03.03.07)
### Requirements
1. Use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records.
2. Record time stamps for audit records that meet [Assignment: organization-defined granularity of time measurement] and that use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), have a fixed local time offset from UTC, or include the local time offset as part of the time stamp.

### Discussion
Time stamps generated by the system include the date and time. Time is often expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) — a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) — or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within hundreds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time granularities for system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities (e.g., access control and identification and authentication), depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.

### 03.03.08 Protection of Audit Information
a. Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.
b. Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to only a subset of privileged users or roles.

#### DISCUSSION
Audit information includes the information needed to successfully audit system activity, such as audit records, audit log settings, audit reports, and personally identifiable information. Audit logging tools are programs and devices used to conduct audit and logging activities. The protection of audit information focuses on technical protection and limits the ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. The physical protection of audit information is addressed by media and physical protection requirements.

Individuals or roles with privileged access to a system and who are also the subject of an audit by that system may affect the reliability of the audit information by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. Requiring privileged access to be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges limits the number of users or roles with audit-related privileges.

#### DISCUSSION
Baseline configurations for the system and system components include aspects of connectivity, operation, and communications. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for the system or configuration items within the system. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to the system and include information about system components, operational procedures, network topology, and the placement of components in the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as the system changes over time. Baseline configurations of the system reflect the current enterprise architecture.

### 03.04.02 Configuration Settings
a. Establish, document, and implement the following configuration settings for the system that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements: [Assignment: organization-defined configuration settings].
b. Identify, document, and approve any deviations from established configuration settings.# Discussion

## Configuration Settings

Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or firmware components of the system and that affect the security posture or functionality of the system. Security-related configuration settings can be defined for:

- Systems (e.g., servers, workstations)
- Input and output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, printers)
- Network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors)
- Operating systems
- Middleware
- Applications

### Security Parameters

Security parameters are those parameters that impact the security state of the system, including the parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. Security parameters include:

- Registry settings
- Account, file, and directory permission settings (i.e., privileges)
- Settings for functions, ports, protocols, and remote connections

Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for the system. The established settings become part of the system’s configuration baseline.

### Common Secure Configurations

Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, and security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations, including:

- Information technology product developers
- Manufacturers
- Vendors
- Consortia
- Academia
- Industry
- Federal agencies
- Other organizations in the public and private sectors

## 03.04.03 Configuration Change Control

1. Define the types of changes to the system that are configuration-controlled.
2. Review proposed configuration-controlled changes to the system, and approve or disapprove such changes with explicit consideration for security impacts.
3. Implement and document approved configuration-controlled changes to the system.
4. Monitor and review activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the system.

### Discussion

Configuration change control refers to tracking, reviewing, approving or disapproving, and logging changes to the system. Specifically, it involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the system, including system upgrades and modifications.

Configuration change control includes:

- Changes to baseline configurations for system components (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, mobile devices)
- Configuration items of the system
- Changes to configuration settings
- Unscheduled and unauthorized changes
- Changes to remediate vulnerabilities

This requirement is related to 03.04.04.

### a.
Analyze changes to the system to determine potential security impacts prior to change implementation.

### b.
Verify that the security requirements for the system continue to be satisfied after the system changes have been implemented.

## Discussion
Organizational personnel with security responsibilities conduct impact analyses that include:
- Reviewing system security plans, policies, and procedures to understand security requirements.
- Reviewing system design documentation and operational procedures to understand how system changes might affect the security state of the system.
- Reviewing the impacts of system changes on supply chain partners with stakeholders.
- Determining how potential changes to a system create new risks and the ability to mitigate those risks.

Impact analyses also include risk assessments to understand the impacts of changes and determine whether additional security requirements are needed. Changes to the system may affect the safeguards and countermeasures previously implemented. This requirement is related to 03.04.03. Not all changes to the system are configuration controlled.

## Discussion
Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system or the operational procedures related to the system can have potentially significant effects on the security of the system. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access the system for the purpose of initiating changes.

Access restrictions include:
- Physical and logical access controls
- Software libraries
- Workflow automation
- Media libraries
- Abstract layers (i.e., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into the system)
- Change windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified times)

### a.
Configure the system to provide only mission-essential capabilities.

### b.
Prohibit or restrict use of the following functions, ports, protocols, connections, and services: [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, connections, and services].

### c.
Review the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to identify unnecessary or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, connections, and services.

### d.
Disable or remove functions, ports, protocols, connections, and services that are unnecessary or nonsecure.

## Discussion
Systems can provide a variety of functions and services. Some functions and services that are routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. It may be convenient to provide multiple services from single system components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit functionality to a single function per component.# System Functions and Services Review

Organizations review the functions and services provided by the system or system components to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent the unauthorized connection of devices, the transfer of information, and tunneling.

Organizations can employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and endpoint protection systems (e.g., firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems) to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, system connections, and services. Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and peer-to-peer networking are examples of the types of protocols that organizations consider eliminating, restricting, or disabling.

# Authorized Software – Allow by Exception

## 03.04.08

a. Identify software programs authorized to execute on the system.
b. Implement a deny-all, allow-by-exception policy for the execution of authorized software programs on the system.
c. Review and update the list of authorized software programs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

## Discussion

If provided with the necessary privileges, users can install software in organizational systems. To maintain control over the software installed, organizations identify permitted and prohibited actions regarding software installation. Permitted software installations include updates and security patches to existing software and downloading new applications from organization-approved “app stores.” The policies selected for governing user-installed software are organization-developed or provided by some external entity. Policy enforcement methods can include procedural methods and automated methods.

Authorized software programs can be limited to specific versions or come from specific sources. To facilitate a comprehensive authorized software process and increase the strength of protection against attacks that bypass application-level authorized software, software programs may be decomposed into and monitored at different levels of detail. These levels include applications, application programming interfaces, application modules, scripts, system processes, system services, kernel functions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link libraries.

# System and Component Configuration for High-Risk Areas

### 03.04.12 System and Component Configuration for High-Risk Areas

a. Issue systems or system components with the following configurations to individuals traveling to high-risk locations: [Assignment: organization-defined system configurations].
b. Apply the following security requirements to the systems or components when the individuals return from travel: [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements].

#### Discussion

When it is known that a system or a system component will be in a high-risk area, additional security requirements may be needed to counter the increased threat. Organizations can implement protective measures on the systems or system components used by individuals departing on and returning from travel.

Actions include:

- Determining whether the locations are of concern
- Defining the required configurations for the components
- Ensuring that the components are configured as intended before travel is initiated
- Taking additional actions after travel is completed

For example, systems going into high-risk areas can be configured with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and more stringent configuration settings. Actions applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include examining the device for signs of physical tampering and purging and reimaging the device storage.

# Identification and Authentication

### 3.5 Identification and Authentication

#### 03.05.01 User Identification and Authentication

a. Uniquely identify and authenticate system users, and associate that unique identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.
b. Re-authenticate users when [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances or conditions].# Security and Authentication Guidelines

## 1. Re-authentication Requirements

### Discussion
System users include individuals (or system processes acting on behalf of individuals) who are authorized to access a system. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames associated with the system accounts assigned to those individuals. Since system processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require the unique identification of individuals in group accounts or the accountability of individual activity. The unique identification and authentication of users apply to all system accesses. Organizations use passwords, physical authenticators, biometrics, or some combination thereof to authenticate user identities. Organizations may reauthenticate individuals in certain situations, including when roles, authenticators, or credentials change; when the execution of privileged functions occurs; after a fixed time period; or periodically.

## 2. Device Identification and Authentication

### Requirement
Uniquely identify and authenticate [Assignment: organization-defined devices or types of devices] before establishing a system connection.

### Discussion
Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication are defined by type, device, or a combination of type and device. Organization-defined device types include devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE] 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate devices on local and wide area networks. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificate revocation checking for the certificates exchanged can be included as part of device authentication.

## 03.05.04 Replay-Resistant Authentication
Implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to privileged and non-privileged accounts.

### Discussion
Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to successfully authenticate by recording or replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include protocols that use nonces or challenges, such as time synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.

4. Manage individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as [Assignment: organization-defined characteristic identifying individual status].

### Discussion
Identifiers are provided for users, processes acting on behalf of users, and devices. Prohibiting the reuse of identifiers prevents the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices. Characteristics that identify the status of individuals include contractors, foreign nationals, and non-organizational users. Identifying the status of individuals by these characteristics provides information about the people with whom organizational personnel are communicating. For example, it is useful for an employee to know that one of the individuals on an email message is a contractor.

## 03.05.07 Password Management
1. Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords, and update the list [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and when organizational passwords are suspected to have been compromised.
2. Verify that passwords are not found on the list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords when users create or update passwords.
3. Transmit passwords only over cryptographically protected channels.
4. Store passwords in a cryptographically protected form.
5. Select a new password upon first use after account recovery.
6. Enforce the following composition and complexity rules for passwords: [Assignment: organization-defined composition and complexity rules].

### Discussion
(Discussion text not provided in the original document.)# Password-Based Authentication

Password-based authentication applies to passwords used in single-factor or multifactor authentication. Long passwords or passphrases are preferable to shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However, organizations may choose to establish and enforce certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum character length) under certain circumstances.

## Password Recovery

For example, account recovery can occur when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof.

## Changing Passwords

Changing temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon ensures that the necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the earliest opportunity and reduces susceptibility to authenticator compromises. Long passwords and passphrases can be used to increase the complexity of passwords.

# Authentication Feedback

## Overview

Authentication feedback does not provide information that would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For example, for desktop or notebook systems with relatively large monitors, the threat may be significant (commonly referred to as shoulder surfing). For mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood of input errors due to small keyboards.

## Obscuring Feedback

Therefore, the means of obscuring authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a limited time before fully obscuring it.

# Authenticator Management

1. Verify the identity of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the authenticator as part of the initial authenticator distribution.
2. Establish initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the organization.
3. Establish and implement administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution; for lost, compromised, or damaged authenticators; and for revoking authenticators.
4. Change default authenticators at first use.
5. Change or refresh authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or when the following events occur: [Assignment: organization-defined events].
6. Protect authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

## Discussion

Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics, and other forms of identification.# Authenticator Management and Incident Response

## Authenticator Management

- **Authenticator Content**: The initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast, requirements for authenticator content contain specific characteristics.

- **Management Support**: Authenticator management is supported by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics, such as:
- Password complexity and composition rules
- Validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens
- Number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication

- **Protection Requirements**: The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented by:
- 03.15.03 for authenticators in the possession of individuals
- 03.01.01, 03.01.02, 03.01.05, and 03.13.08 for authenticators stored in organizational systems

- **Actions for Protection**: Actions can be taken to protect authenticators, including:
- Maintaining possession of authenticators
- Not sharing authenticators with others
- Immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators

- **Default Credentials**: Developers may deliver system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well-known, easily discoverable, and present a significant risk.

- **Management of Authenticators**: Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking authenticators for temporary access when they are no longer needed. The use of long passwords or passphrases may obviate the need to periodically change authenticators.

### Maintenance Tools (03.07.04)
1. Approve, control, and monitor the use of system maintenance tools.
2. Check media with diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before it is used in the system.
3. Prevent the removal of system maintenance equipment containing Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) by:
- Verifying that there is no CUI on the equipment
- Sanitizing or destroying the equipment
- Retaining the equipment within the facility.

### Discussion
Approving, controlling, monitoring, and reviewing maintenance tools address security-related issues associated with the tools that are used for diagnostic and repair actions on the system. Maintenance tools can include hardware and software.# Diagnostic and Test Equipment

Diagnostic and test equipment, including packet sniffers, can be preinstalled, brought in by maintenance personnel on media, cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. These diagnostic and test programs can potentially transport malicious code into the system, either intentionally or unintentionally.

## Media Inspection

Examples of media inspection include checking the cryptographic hash or digital signatures of diagnostic and test programs and media. If organizations inspect media that contain diagnostic and test programs and determine that the media also contain malicious code, the incident is handled consistent with incident handling policies and procedures. A periodic review of system maintenance tools can result in the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-used tools. Maintenance tools do not address the hardware and software components that support maintenance and are considered a part of the system.

# Maintenance Personnel

## 03.07.06 Maintenance Personnel

1. Establish a process for maintenance personnel authorization.
2. Maintain a list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel.
3. Verify that non-escorted personnel who perform maintenance on the system possess the required access authorizations.
4. Designate organizational personnel with required access authorizations and technical competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the required access authorizations.

### Discussion

Maintenance personnel refers to individuals who perform hardware or software maintenance on the system, while 03.10.01 addresses physical access for individuals whose maintenance duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the system. The technical competence of supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the system, while having required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the system. Individuals who have not been previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel (e.g., manufacturers, consultants, systems integrators, and vendors) may require privileged access to the system, such as when they are required to conduct maintenance with little or no notice. Organizations may choose to issue temporary credentials to these individuals based on their risk assessments. Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.

### DISCUSSION
System media include digital and non-digital media. Digital media include diskettes, flash drives, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media include paper and microfilm.

Physically controlling stored media includes conducting inventories, establishing procedures to allow individuals to check out and return media to libraries, and maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet or a controlled media library. Controlled areas provide physical and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

Sanitization techniques (e.g., destroying, cryptographically erasing, clearing, and purging) prevent the disclosure of CUI to unauthorized individuals. The sanitization process removes CUI from media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed.

## 03.08.03 Media Sanitization
Sanitize system media that contain CUI prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for reuse.

### DISCUSSION
Media sanitization applies to digital and non-digital media that are subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media are considered removable. Examples include digital media in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, mobile devices, workstations, network components, and non-digital media.

The sanitization process removes CUI from media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques (e.g., cryptographically erasing, clearing, purging, and destroying) prevent the disclosure of CUI to unauthorized individuals when such media are reused or released for disposal. NARA policies control the sanitization process for media that contain CUI and may require destruction when other methods cannot be applied to the media.

a. Protect and control system media that contain CUI during transport outside of controlled areas.
b. Maintain accountability of system media that contain CUI during transport outside of controlled areas.
c. Document activities associated with the transport of system media that contain CUI.

### Discussion

System media include digital and non-digital media. Digital media include flash drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media include microfilm and paper. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural measures to meet the requirements established for protecting CUI and systems. Media protection during transport can include cryptography and/or locked containers. Activities associated with media transport include releasing media for transport, ensuring that media enter the appropriate transport processes, and the actual transport. Authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking or obtaining the records of transport activities as the media move through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. This requirement is related to 03.13.08 and 03.13.11.

## 03.08.07 Media Use

a. Restrict or prohibit the use of [Assignment: organization-defined types of system media].
b. Prohibit the use of removable system media without an identifiable owner.

### Discussion

In contrast to requirement 03.08.01, which restricts user access to media, this requirement restricts or prohibits the use of certain types of media, such as external hard drives, flash drives, or smart displays. Organizations can use technical and non-technical measures (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control the use of system media. For example, organizations may control the use of portable storage devices by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read, or write to devices.# Portable Storage Device Usage

Organizations may limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Organizations may also control the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device—prohibiting the use of writable, portable devices—and implement this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices.

Limits on the use of organization-controlled system media in external systems include restrictions on how the media may be used and under what conditions. Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for removable system media reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to assign responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the media (e.g., insertion of malicious code).

a. Protect the confidentiality of backup information.
b. Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI at backup storage locations.

### Discussion

The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality of backup information. Hardware security module (HSM) devices safeguard and manage cryptographic keys and provide cryptographic processing. Cryptographic operations (e.g., encryption, decryption, and signature generation and verification) are typically hosted on the HSM device, and many implementations provide hardware-accelerated mechanisms for cryptographic operations. This requirement is related to 03.13.11.

## 1. Access Authorization Review
1. Review and confirm the ongoing operational need for current logical and physical access authorizations to the system and facility.
2. Modify access authorization to correspond with any changes in operational need.

## Discussion
Security-related system property includes hardware authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees and that accountability is achieved for the organizational property. Security topics at exit interviews include reminding individuals of potential limitations on future employment and non-disclosure agreements.

Exit interviews may not always be possible for some individuals, including in cases related to the unavailability of supervisors, illnesses, or job abandonment. The timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals who have been terminated for cause. Organizations may consider disabling the accounts of individuals who are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified.

This requirement applies to the reassignment or transfer of individuals when the personnel action is permanent or of such extended duration as to require protection. Protections that may be required for transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations include:
- Returning old and issuing new identification cards, keys, and building passes.
- Changing system access authorizations (i.e., privileges).
- Closing system accounts and establishing new accounts.
- Providing access to official records to which individuals had access at previous work locations in previous system accounts.

# Risk Assessment

## Risk Assessment Requirements
- Assess the risk (including supply chain risk) of unauthorized disclosure resulting from the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI.
- Update risk assessments [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

## Discussion
Establishing the system boundary is a prerequisite to assessing the risk of the unauthorized disclosure of CUI. Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets based on the assessment.# Risk Management and Vulnerability Monitoring

## 1. Risk Assessments

Risk assessments consider the operation and use of the system and the unauthorized disclosure of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). They also take into account risks from external parties, such as:

- Contractors operating systems on behalf of the organization
- Service providers
- Individuals accessing systems
- Outsourcing entities

Risk assessments can be conducted at various levels:

- Organization level
- Mission or business process level
- System level

These assessments can occur at any phase in the system development life cycle and include supply chain-related risks associated with suppliers or contractors and the systems, components, or services they provide.

b. Remediate system vulnerabilities within organization-defined response times.

c. Update system vulnerabilities to be scanned at an organization-defined frequency and when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.

### Discussion

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for system components and ensure that potential sources of vulnerabilities (e.g., networked printers, scanners, and copiers) are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as:

- Static analysis
- Dynamic analysis
- Binary analysis

These approaches can be used in source code reviews and tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes:

- Scanning for patch levels
- Scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices
- Scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating flow control mechanisms

To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention. Sources for vulnerability information also include:

- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing
- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Respond to findings from security assessments, monitoring, and audits.

### Discussion

This requirement addresses the need to determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of action and milestones (POAM) entry. It may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so that a POAM entry is not needed. However, a POAM entry is generated if the risk response is to mitigate the identified risk and the mitigation cannot be completed immediately.

## 3.12.01 Security Assessment
Assess the security requirements for the system and its environment of operation [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to determine if the requirements have been satisfied.

### Discussion
By assessing the security requirements, organizations determine whether the necessary safeguards and countermeasures are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome. Security assessments identify weaknesses in the system and provide the essential information needed to make risk-based decisions. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by the organization to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports. Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted.

## 3.12.02 Plan of Action and Milestones
a. Develop a plan of action and milestones for the system:
1. To document the planned remediation actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during security assessments and
2. To reduce or eliminate known system vulnerabilities.

b. Update the existing plan of action and milestones based on the findings from:
1. Security assessments,
2. Audits or reviews, and
3. Continuous monitoring activities.

### Discussion
Plans of action and milestones (POAMs) are important documents in organizational security programs. Organizations use POAMs to describe how unsatisfied security requirements will be met and how planned mitigations will be implemented. Organizations can document system security plans and POAMs as separate or combined documents in any format. Federal agencies may consider system security plans and POAMs as inputs to risk-based decisions on whether to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted by a nonfederal organization.

## 3.12.03 Continuous Monitoring
Develop and implement a system-level continuous monitoring strategy that includes ongoing monitoring and security assessments.

### Discussion
Continuous monitoring at the system level facilitates ongoing awareness of the system security posture to support risk management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess and monitor their systems at a frequency that is sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of security requirements may require different monitoring frequencies.

## 3. Discussion
Information exchange applies to exchanges between two or more systems, both internal and external to the organization. Organizations must consider the risks related to new or increased threats that may arise when systems exchange information with others that have different security requirements or policies.

### Factors Influencing Agreement Types
- Relationship between organizations (e.g., government to government, business to business, etc.)
- Level of access to the organizational system by users of the other system.

### Incorporation into Contracts
Organizations may incorporate agreement information into formal contracts, especially for exchanges established between federal agencies and non-federal organizations (e.g., service providers, contractors, system developers, and system integrators).

### 03.13.04 Information in Shared System Resources
Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.

#### Discussion
Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources stops information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles (or current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system resources after those resources have been released back to the system. Information in shared system resources also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, the control of information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence, which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted, covert channels (including storage and timing channels) in which shared system resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions, or components within systems for which there are only single users or roles.

#### Discussion
This requirement applies to internal and external networks and any system components that can transmit CUI, including servers, notebook computers, desktop computers, mobile devices, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and radios. Unprotected communication paths are susceptible to interception and modification. Encryption protects CUI from unauthorized disclosure during transmission and while in storage. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the confidentiality of CUI during transmission include TLS and IPsec. Information in storage (i.e., information at rest) refers to the state of CUI when it is not in process or in transit and resides on internal or external storage devices, storage area network devices, and databases.

# Mobile Code

## Definition
a. Define acceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies.
b. Authorize, monitor, and control the use of mobile code.

## Discussion
Mobile code includes software programs or parts of programs that are obtained from remote systems, transmitted across a network, and executed on a local system without explicit installation or execution by the recipient. Decisions regarding the use of mobile code are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the system if used maliciously. Mobile code technologies include Java applets, JavaScript, HTML5, VBScript, and WebGL. Usage restrictions and implementation guidelines apply to the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and downloaded and executed on individual workstations and devices, including notebook computers, smartphones, and smart devices. Mobile code policies and procedures address the actions taken to prevent the development, acquisition, and use of unacceptable mobile code within the system, including requiring mobile code to be digitally signed by a trusted source.

### Discussion

Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities that result from those flaws, and report this information to designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address the flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources (e.g., CWE or CVE databases) when remediating system flaws. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors, including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types.

## 3.14.02 Malicious Code Protection

a. Implement malicious code protection mechanisms at system entry and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code.
b. Update malicious code protection mechanisms as new releases are available in accordance with configuration management policies and procedures.
c. Configure malicious code protection mechanisms to:
1. Perform scans of the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and real-time scans of files from external sources at endpoints or system entry and exit points as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed; and
2. Block malicious code, quarantine malicious code, or take other mitigation actions in response to malicious code detection.

### Discussion

Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Malicious code can be inserted into the system in a variety of ways, including email, the internet, and portable storage devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats, contained in compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software and custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.

Periodic scans of the system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed can detect malicious code. Malicious code protection mechanisms can also monitor systems for anomalous or unexpected behaviors and take appropriate actions. Malicious code protection mechanisms include signature- and non-signature-based technologies. Non-signature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective.# Security Measures and Practices

## Malicious Code Detection and Prevention

Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). Non-signature-based mechanisms include reputation-based technologies. Pervasive configuration management, anti-exploitation software, and software integrity controls may also be effective in preventing unauthorized code execution.

If malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations can rely on secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that the software only performs intended functions. Organizations may determine that different actions are warranted in response to the detection of malicious code. For example, organizations can define actions to be taken in response to the detection of malicious code during scans, malicious downloads, or malicious activity when attempting to open or execute files.

## Security Alerts, Advisories, and Directives

### 03.14.03 Security Alerts, Advisories, and Directives

a. Receive system security alerts, advisories, and directives from external organizations on an ongoing basis.
b. Generate and disseminate internal system security alerts, advisories, and directives, as necessary.

#### Discussion

There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts and advisories. The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) generate security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the Federal Government and in nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription services, and industry Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) may also provide security alerts and advisories. Compliance with security directives is essential due to the critical nature of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not be implemented in a timely manner.

a. Monitor the system to detect:
1. Attacks and indicators of potential attacks
2. Unauthorized connections.
b. Identify unauthorized use of the system.
c. Monitor inbound and outbound communications traffic to detect unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions.

#### Discussion

System monitoring involves external and internal monitoring. Internal monitoring includes the observation of events that occur within the system. External monitoring focuses on the interactions and communications that occur outside the system.# Monitoring

Monitoring includes the observation of events that occur at the system boundary. Organizations can monitor the system by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects, such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide the determination of the events.

A system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., audit record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms that support critical applications, with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives.

## System Connections

Systems connections can be network, remote, or local. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, the internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device that communicates through an external network (e.g., the internet). Network, remote, and local connections can be either wired or wireless.

## Unusual or Unauthorized Activities

Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in the system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information, or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify a potentially compromised system. System monitoring requirements, including the need for types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements.

# 03.15.02 System Security Plan

a. Develop a system security plan that:
1. Defines the constituent system components;
2. Identifies the information types processed, stored, and transmitted by the system;
3. Describes specific threats to the system that are of concern to the organization;
4. Describes the operational environment for the system and any dependencies on or connections to other systems or system components;
5. Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system;
6. Describes the safeguards in place or planned for meeting the security requirements;
7. Identifies individuals that fulfill system roles and responsibilities; and
8. Includes other relevant information necessary for the protection of CUI.

b. Review and update the system security plan [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

c. Protect the system security plan from unauthorized disclosure.

## Discussion

System security plans provide key characteristics of the system that is processing, storing, and transmitting CUI and how the system and information are protected. System security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and the subsequent determinations of risk if the plan is implemented as intended. System security plans can be a collection of documents, including documents that already exist. Effective system security plans reference policies, procedures, and documents (e.g., design specifications) that provide additional detailed information. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security information in other established management or operational areas related to enterprise architecture, the system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition.

## 3.16.01 Security Engineering Principles

Apply the following systems security engineering principles to the development or modification of the system and system components:

**[Assignment: organization-defined systems security engineering principles].**

### Discussion

Organizations apply systems security engineering principles to new development systems. For legacy systems, organizations apply these principles to system modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components. The application of systems security engineering principles helps to develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduces the susceptibility of organizations to disruptions, hazards, and threats.

Examples include:
- Developing layered protections
- Establishing security policies, architectures, and controls as the foundation for system design
- Incorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle
- Delineating physical and logical security boundaries
- Ensuring that developers are trained on how to build trustworthy secure software
- Performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk

Organizations that apply security engineering principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risks to acceptable levels; and make informed risk-management decisions.

## 3.16.02 Unsupported System Components

a. Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer.

b. Provide options for risk mitigation or alternative sources for continued support for unsupported components that cannot be replaced.

### Discussion

Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components includes situations where vendors no longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in opportunities for adversaries to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies in the installed components.

Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business capabilities when newer technologies are unavailable or when the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.

Alternative sources of support address the need to provide continued support for system components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors when such components remain essential to organizational missions and business functions. If necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for critical software components or obtain the services of external service providers who provide ongoing support for unsupported components through contractual relationships.# Security Requirements for External System Services and Supply Chain Risk Management

## 1. External System Services

### 1.1 Security Requirements
a. Require the providers of external system services used for the processing, storage, or transmission of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) to comply with the following security requirements: [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements].

b. Define and document user roles and responsibilities with regard to external system services, including shared responsibilities with external service providers.

c. Implement processes, methods, and techniques to monitor security requirement compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis.

### 1.2 Discussion
External system services are provided by external service providers. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain exchanges.

The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services remains with the organization charged with protecting CUI. Service-level agreements define expectations of performance, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies, mitigations, and response requirements for instances of noncompliance.

Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions, ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when there is a need to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services or blocking certain ports and protocols. This requirement is related to 03.01.20.

## 2. Supply Chain Risk Management

### 2.1 Supply Chain Risk Management Plan
a. Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and disposal of the system, system components, or system services.

b. Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

c. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure.

### 2.2 Discussion
Dependence on the products, systems, and services of external providers and the nature of the relationships with those providers present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions that may increase security risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain, theft, and the insertion of malicious software, firmware, and hardware.

Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system, component, or service. Managing supply chain risks is a complex task that requires ongoing attention and adaptation to emerging threats.# Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)

## Overview
Supply chain risk management (SCRM) is a multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders.

## SCRM Activities
SCRM activities include:
- Identifying and assessing risks
- Determining appropriate risk response actions
- Developing SCRM plans to document response actions
- Monitoring performance against the plans

The system-level SCRM plan is implementation-specific and provides constraints, policy implementation, requirements, and implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security plans. The SCRM plan addresses the management, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM requirements and the development or sustainment of systems across the system development life cycle to support mission and business functions.

Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to individual program, organizational, and operational contexts.

# Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods

## Overview
Develop and implement acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to identify, protect against, and mitigate supply chain risks.

## Discussion
The acquisition process provides an important vehicle for protecting the supply chain. There are many useful tools and techniques available, including:
- Obscuring the end use of a system or system component
- Using blind purchases
- Requiring tamper-evident packaging
- Using trusted or controlled distribution

The results from a supply chain risk assessment can inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against:
- Unauthorized production
- Theft
- Tampering
- The insertion of counterfeits
- The insertion of malicious software or backdoors
- Poor development practices throughout the system life cycle

Organizations also consider:
- Providing incentives for suppliers to implement safeguards
- Promoting transparency in their processes and security practices
- Providing contract language that addresses the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components
- Restricting purchases from untrustworthy suppliers

Additionally, organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for personnel regarding supply chain risks, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation, and evidence are commensurate with the security requirements of the organization. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.

# Supply Chain Requirements and Processes

## Requirements
a. Establish a process for identifying and addressing weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes.

b. Enforce the following security requirements to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system components, or system services and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events:
- [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements].# Discussion

Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools that are employed for the research, development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components.

Supply chain processes include:

- Hardware, software, firmware, and systems development processes
- Shipping and handling procedures
- Physical security programs
- Personnel security programs
- Configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance
- Other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components.

Supply chain elements and processes are provided by organizations, system integrators, or external service providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to harm the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or business functions.
