# Abstract
This publication provides a catalog of Internet of Things (IoT) device cybersecurity capabilities (i.e., features and functions needed from a device to support security controls) and non-technical supporting capabilities (i.e., actions and support needed from device manufacturers and other supporting entities to support security controls) that can help organizations as they use Special Publication (SP) 800-213 to determine and establish device cybersecurity requirements. This catalog cross-references the capabilities in the catalog to the cybersecurity controls in NIST SP 800-53. Organizations should refer to SP 800-213 as that publication provides necessary context to effectively use this catalog and related material.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Applicability
This publication is intended to help federal organizations determine device cybersecurity requirements for IoT devices they seek to use with federal information systems and other systems operated by the federal government. IoT devices in-scope for this publication have at least one transducer (sensor or actuator) for interacting directly with the physical world and at least one network interface (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Long-term Evolution (LTE), Zigbee, Ultra-Wideband (UWB)) for interfacing with the digital world. The IoT devices in-scope for this publication can function on their own, although they may be dependent on specific other devices (e.g., an IoT hub) or systems (e.g., a cloud) for some functionality.

This publication shall be used with the guidance in Special Publication (SP) 800-213, IoT Cybersecurity Guidance for the Federal Government: Establishing IoT Device Cybersecurity Requirements [800-213]. Federal organizations can use this catalog of device cybersecurity requirements to determine those appropriate to support the security controls implemented on their system and in their organization.

Device cybersecurity requirements are device cybersecurity capabilities and non-technical supporting capabilities needed to integrate an IoT device into a system. Device cybersecurity capabilities are cybersecurity features or functions that computing devices provide through their own technical means (i.e., device hardware and software). For example, data protection using encryption would be a device cybersecurity capability if implemented on an IoT device. Non-technical supporting capabilities are actions an organization (i.e., manufacturers of IoT devices or designated third-party entities with a supporting role) performs in support of the cybersecurity of an IoT device. For example, notifications when an update is available and training on how to apply the software update may be a non-technical supporting capability needed by a federal organization in support of the cybersecurity of an IoT device.

This catalog provides a resource for federal organizations to use in determining and describing...# Device Cybersecurity Requirements

## 1. Introduction
Device cybersecurity requirements are essential to support security in information systems and organizations. When used alongside the guidance in SP 800-213 and the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), this catalog can enhance the security posture of systems and elements.

## 1.2 Target Audience
The target audience for this publication includes:

- Information security professionals
- System administrators
- Procurement professionals
- Others in federal organizations tasked with assessing, applying, and maintaining security on federal information systems.

Personnel within the following Workforce Categories and Specialty Areas from the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity are most likely to find this publication of interest:

- **Securely Provision**: Risk Management, Systems Architecture, Systems Development

- **Oversee and Govern**: Cybersecurity Management, Executive Cyber Leadership, Program/Project Management and Acquisition
- **Protect and Defend**: Cybersecurity Defense Analysis, Cybersecurity Defense Infrastructure Support, Incident Response, Vulnerability Assessment and Management

## 1.3 Relationship to Other Publications
This publication directly relates to SP 800-213. It also builds upon the foundational cybersecurity for IoT work from NIST documented in NISTIR 8228 and the NISTIR 8259 series. Direct mappings and references to SP 800-53 are also included in the catalog to illustrate the connection between device cybersecurity requirements and security controls that a federal organization may be using.

## 1.4 Publication Organization
The remainder of this publication contains the catalog of device cybersecurity requirements divided into two sections:

- **Section 2**: Details seven device cybersecurity capabilities and several related sub-capabilities that may be needed from an IoT device to support system security controls.
- **Section 3**: Details four non-technical supporting capabilities and several related sub-capabilities that may be needed from IoT device manufacturers and supporting entities.

Each section of device cybersecurity requirements provides the name, description, and additional informative discussion for each capability and sub-capability. Many sub-capabilities include additional information in the form of individual requirements that may be part of the device cybersecurity requirement. Each sub-capability includes a mapping to applicable SP 800-53 controls.

### Figure 1
Figure 1 illustrates the structure of a capability and sub-capability. Each capability is named and defined with a short description, accompanied by further discussion about the nature of and need for the capability overall. These high-level descriptions can assist organizations in identifying which capabilities they should consider in support of system and organizational security controls. In this context of SP 800-213, a...# Device Cybersecurity Capability Catalog

## Overview
Capability is further defined by the sub-capabilities that describe the details of device cybersecurity requirements. For each capability, this catalog also documents sub-capabilities that describe distinct, more specific details to further define support needed related to the higher-level capability. The need for a sub-capability or its elements is guided by the cybersecurity needs of the organization as described in SP 800-213.

## Structure of Sub-Capabilities
Figure 1 shows the structure of a sub-capability, which, like capabilities, are named and defined with a short description and further discussion about the sub-capability and why it may be needed.

### Mapping to SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Controls
A mapping to related SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls is also provided for each sub-capability that can help organizations identify the controls and/or enhancements that may be supported by each sub-capability. This support for controls may come from a fulfillment of all or part of a control by the presence of the functionality or actions described in the sub-capability.

For example, the control may state that the element should function in a specific way, and the sub-capability describes how the IoT device should function based on the control. In other cases, support for controls is in the form of enabling the system and/or organization to perform some system/organization-wide function or action including the IoT device.

### Independence of Controls
Controls are considered independent of their inclusion in SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations [800-53B], and so some controls included in the related controls list may not be in the low-, moderate-, and/or high-impact baseline. As explored in SP 800-213 [800-213], these mappings are meant to be used with a prior understanding of security controls to the system to which the IoT device will connect and selection of device cybersecurity requirements guided by that understanding. The mappings do not imply that each mapped security control is necessary in the presence of the sub-capability.

## Individual Requirements
Finally, many sub-capabilities contain individual requirements that can be used by the organization to provide additional detail to a device cybersecurity requirement based on their applicability.

## Using Catalog Content Identifiers
Throughout this catalog, each capability and sub-capability are given identifiers that allow for shorter identification of specific content. For example, the Cybersecurity State Awareness sub-capability Access to Event Information shown in Figure 1 could be referred to as CS:AEI.

Additionally, the numbered requirements that may be necessary can be referred to using those numerals (e.g., CS:AEI(1) or CS:AEI(2)). Finally, some requirements that may be necessary have another level below that are labeled using alphabetic characters (i.e., a, b, c), which can also be incorporated into this shorthand (e.g., DO:SMP(1a) or DO:SMP(2a,b)). This notation is used in Appendices B and C.# Device Cybersecurity Capabilities

A device cybersecurity capability is a feature or function that computing devices (i.e., an IoT device) provide through their own technical means (i.e., device hardware and software) [800-213]. Organizations will often need device cybersecurity capabilities to be present in system elements, including IoT devices, that directly or indirectly implement and support security controls. This section identifies device cybersecurity capabilities and sub-capabilities organizations should consider when establishing device cybersecurity requirements. The identified device cybersecurity capabilities are:

- Device Identification
- Device Configuration
- Data Protection
- Logical Access to Interfaces
- Software Update
- Cybersecurity State Awareness
- Device Security

## DI - Device Identification

### Description
The capability to identify the IoT device for multiple purposes and in multiple ways to meet organizational requirements.

### Discussion
Device identification supports many cybersecurity needs and goals, such as asset management, vulnerability management, access management, data protection, and incident detection. The unique logical identifier can be used to distinguish the device from all others, usually for automated device management and monitoring. Multiple identifiers may be necessary for an organization, each possibly to be used together or for individual purposes. For example, an IoT device may support both a way to identify it uniquely on the system or Internet as well as a way to identify its expected device behavior (e.g., using a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) URL).

### Sub-Capabilities that may be necessary:

#### (IMS) Identifier Management Support

#### (AID) Actions Based on Device Identity

**Description:** Ability to perform actions that can occur based on or using the identity of the device.

**Discussion:** Using IoT device identifiers to perform additional actions can help provide assurance that security controls are applied to all applicable system elements by allowing for...# Differentiation Between Devices and Security Controls

## Overview
The logical access to interfaces capability supports cybersecurity needs and goals such as vulnerability management, access management, data protection, and incident detection. The ability to access the device will support its management and use for cybersecurity.

## Importance of Access Control
Some form factors or use cases may vary in the kinds of interfaces available for accessing the device (e.g., if a physical screen is not possible). A key aspect of this capability is the ability for organizations to control access to interfaces. Limiting access to interfaces reduces the attack surface of the device, giving attackers fewer opportunities to compromise it.

For example, unrestricted network access to an IoT device enables attackers to directly interact with the device, which significantly increases the likelihood of the device being compromised. Authentication of other entities (e.g., humans, other devices) will be a common way to support logical access to interfaces, which has been addressed in FIPS 201-2 [FIPS201] and SP 800-63 [800-63].

## Sub-Capabilities

### (AUN) Authentication Support
