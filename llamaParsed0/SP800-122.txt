# Executive Summary

The escalation of security breaches involving personally identifiable information (PII) has contributed to the loss of millions of records over the past few years. Breaches involving PII are hazardous to both individuals and organizations. Individual harms may include identity theft, embarrassment, or blackmail. Organizational harms may include a loss of public trust, legal liability, or remediation costs.

To appropriately protect the confidentiality of PII, organizations should use a risk-based approach; as McGeorge Bundy once stated, "If we guard our toothbrushes and diamonds with equal zeal, we will lose fewer toothbrushes and more diamonds." This document provides guidelines for a risk-based approach to protecting the confidentiality of PII. The recommendations in this document are intended primarily for U.S. Federal government agencies and those who conduct business on behalf of the agencies, but other organizations may find portions of the publication useful.

Each organization may be subject to a different combination of laws, regulations, and other mandates related to protecting PII, so an organization’s legal counsel and privacy officer should be consulted to determine the current obligations for PII protection. For example, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued several memoranda with requirements for how Federal agencies must handle and protect PII.

To effectively protect PII, organizations should implement the following recommendations:

## Identify All PII

Organizations should identify all PII residing in their environment. An organization cannot properly protect PII it does not know about. This document uses a broad definition of PII to identify as many potential sources of PII as possible (e.g., databases, shared network drives, backup tapes, contractor sites). PII is defined as "any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information."

### Examples of PII include, but are not limited to:

- **Name**: such as full name, maiden name, mother’s maiden name, or alias
- **Personal identification number**: such as social security number (SSN), passport number, driver’s license number, taxpayer identification number, or financial account or credit card number
- **Address information**: such as street address or email address
- **Personal characteristics**: including photographic image (especially of face or other identifying characteristic), fingerprints, handwriting, or other biometric data (e.g., retina scan, voice signature, facial geometry)
- **Information about an individual**: that is linked or linkable to one of the above (e.g., date of birth, place of birth, race, religion, weight, activities, geographical indicators, employment information, medical information, education information, financial information)

## Minimize Use, Collection, and Retention of PII

Organizations should minimize the use, collection, and retention of PII to what is strictly necessary to accomplish their business purpose and mission.# Minimizing Harm from PII Breaches

The likelihood of harm caused by a breach involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is greatly reduced if an organization minimizes the amount of PII it uses, collects, and stores.

## Best Practices for PII Management

1. **Request Only Necessary PII**: An organization should only request PII in a new form if the PII is absolutely necessary.
2. **Regular Review of PII Holdings**: Organizations should regularly review their holdings of previously collected PII to determine whether the PII is still relevant and necessary for meeting the organization’s business purpose and mission. For example, organizations could have an annual PII purging awareness day.

## OMB M-07-16 Requirements

OMB M-07-16 specifically requires agencies to:

- Review current holdings of PII and ensure they are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete.
- Reduce PII holdings to the minimum necessary for proper performance of agency functions.
- Develop a schedule for periodic review of PII holdings.
- Establish a plan to eliminate the unnecessary collection and use of Social Security Numbers (SSNs).

## Categorizing PII by Confidentiality Impact Level

Organizations should categorize their PII by the PII confidentiality impact level. All PII is not created equal. PII should be evaluated to determine its confidentiality impact level, which is different from the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 199 confidentiality impact level.

### PII Confidentiality Impact Levels

The PII confidentiality impact level—low, moderate, or high—indicates the potential harm that could result to the subject individuals and/or the organization if PII were inappropriately accessed, used, or disclosed.

## Factors for Determining PII Confidentiality Impact Level

This document provides a list of factors an organization should consider when determining the PII confidentiality impact level. Each organization should decide which factors it will use for determining impact levels and then create and implement the appropriate policy, procedures, and controls. The following are examples of factors:

1. **Identifiability**: Organizations should evaluate how easily PII can be used to identify specific individuals. For example, a SSN uniquely and directly identifies an individual, whereas a telephone area code identifies a set of people.

2. **Quantity of PII**: Organizations should consider how many individuals can be identified from the PII. Breaches of 25 records and 25 million records may have different impacts. The PII confidentiality impact level should only be raised and not lowered based on this factor.

3. **Data Field Sensitivity**: Organizations should evaluate the sensitivity of each individual PII data field. For example, an individual’s SSN or financial account number is generally more sensitive than an individual’s phone number or ZIP code. Organizations should also evaluate the sensitivity of the PII data fields when combined.

4. **Context of Use**: Organizations should evaluate the context of use—the purpose for which the PII is collected, stored, used, processed, disclosed, or disseminated. The context of use may cause the same PII data elements to be assigned different PII confidentiality impact levels based on their use. For example, suppose that an organization has two lists that contain the same PII data fields (e.g., name, address, phone number). The first list is people who subscribe to a general...# Interest Newsletter

## Introduction
Produced by the organization, the second list is of people who work undercover in law enforcement. If the confidentiality of the lists is breached, the potential impacts to the affected individuals and to the organization are significantly different for each list.

## Obligations to Protect Confidentiality
An organization that is subject to any obligations to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should consider such obligations when determining the PII confidentiality impact level. Obligations to protect generally include laws, regulations, or other mandates (e.g., Privacy Act, OMB guidance).

For example, some Federal agencies, such as the Census Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), are subject to specific legal obligations to protect certain types of PII.

## Access to and Location of PII
Organizations may choose to take into consideration the nature of authorized access to and the location of PII. When PII is accessed more often or by more people and systems, or the PII is regularly transmitted or transported offsite, then there are more opportunities to compromise the confidentiality of the PII.

Organizations should apply the appropriate safeguards for PII based on the PII confidentiality impact level. Not all PII should be protected in the same way. Organizations should apply appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of PII based on the PII confidentiality impact level. Some PII does not need to have its confidentiality protected, such as information that the organization has permission or authority to release publicly (e.g., an organization’s public phone directory).

## Recommended Safeguards
NIST recommends using operational safeguards, privacy-specific safeguards, and security controls, such as:

### Creating Policies and Procedures
Organizations should develop comprehensive policies and procedures for protecting the confidentiality of PII.

### Conducting Training
Organizations should reduce the possibility that PII will be accessed, used, or disclosed inappropriately by requiring that all individuals receive appropriate training before being granted access to systems containing PII.

### De-Identifying PII
Organizations can de-identify records by removing enough PII such that the remaining information does not identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual. De-identified records can be used when full records are not necessary, such as for examinations of correlations and trends.

### Using Access Enforcement
Organizations can control access to PII through access control policies and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists).

### Implementing Access Control for Mobile Devices
Organizations can prohibit or strictly limit access to PII from portable and mobile devices, such as laptops, cell phones, and personal digital assistants (PDA), which are generally higher-risk than non-portable devices (e.g., desktop computers at the organization’s facilities).

### Providing Transmission Confidentiality
Organizations can protect the confidentiality of transmitted PII. This is most often accomplished by encrypting the communications or by encrypting the data being transmitted.# Protecting the Confidentiality of PII

## Auditing Events
Organizations can monitor events that affect the confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as inappropriate access to PII.

Organizations should develop an incident response plan to handle breaches involving PII. Breaches involving PII are hazardous to both individuals and organizations. Harm to individuals and organizations can be contained and minimized through the development of effective incident response plans for breaches involving PII.

Organizations should develop plans that include elements such as:
- Determining when and how individuals should be notified
- How a breach should be reported
- Whether to provide remedial services, such as credit monitoring, to affected individuals

Organizations should encourage close coordination among their chief privacy officers, senior agency officials for privacy, chief information officers, chief information security officers, and legal counsel when addressing issues related to PII.

## Knowledge Requirements
Protecting the confidentiality of PII requires knowledge of information systems, information security, privacy, and legal requirements. Decisions regarding the applicability of a particular law, regulation, or other mandate should be made in consultation with an organization’s legal counsel and privacy officer because relevant laws, regulations, and other mandates are often complex and change over time.

Additionally, new policies often require the implementation of technical security controls to enforce the policies. Close coordination of the relevant experts helps to prevent incidents that could result in the compromise and misuse of PII by ensuring proper interpretation and implementation of requirements.

## 1. Introduction to PII
One of the most widely used terms to describe personal information is PII. Examples of PII range from an individual’s name or email address to an individual’s financial and medical records or criminal history. Unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of PII can seriously harm both individuals, by contributing to identity theft, blackmail, or embarrassment, and the organization, by reducing public trust in the organization or creating legal liability.

This section explains how to identify and locate PII maintained within an organization’s environment and/or under its control, and it provides an introduction to the Fair Information Practices. Sections 3 and 4 discuss factors for assigning PII impact levels and selecting safeguards, respectively. Section 5 discusses incident response for breaches involving PII.

### 1.1 Identifying PII
PII is defined as "any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information."

To distinguish an individual is to identify an individual. Some examples of information that could identify an individual include, but are not limited to, name, passport number, social security number, or biometric data. In contrast, a list containing only credit scores without any additional information concerning the individuals to whom they relate does not provide sufficient information to distinguish a specific individual.

To trace an individual is to process sufficient information to make a determination about a specific aspect of an individual’s activities or status. For example, an audit log containing records of user actions could be used to trace an individual’s activities.

Linked information is information about or related to an individual that is logically associated with other information about the individual. In contrast, linkable information is information about or related to an individual for which there is a possibility of logical association with other information about the individual.

For example, if two databases contain different PII elements, then someone with access to both databases may be able to link the information from the two databases and identify individuals, as well as access additional information about or relating to the individuals. If the secondary information source is present on the same system or a closely-related system and does not have security controls that effectively segregate the information sources, then the data is considered linked. If the secondary information source is maintained more remotely, such as in an unrelated system within the organization, available in public records, or otherwise readily obtainable (e.g., internet search engine), then the data is considered linkable.# Identifying and Managing Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Organizations are required to identify all PII residing within their organization or under the control of their organization through a third party (e.g., a system being developed and tested by a contractor).

## Methods to Identify PII

Organizations should use a variety of methods to identify PII. Privacy threshold analyses (PTAs), also referred to as initial privacy assessments (IPAs), are often used to identify PII. Some organizations require a PTA to be completed before the development or acquisition of a new information system and when a substantial change is made to an existing system.

### Purpose of PTAs

PTAs are used to determine:
- If a system contains PII
- Whether a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is required
- Whether a System of Records Notice (SORN) is required
- If any other privacy requirements apply to the information system

PTAs are usually submitted to an organization’s privacy office for review and approval. They are comprised of simple questionnaires that are completed by the system owner in collaboration with the data owner.

### Benefits of PTAs

PTAs are useful in initiating communication and collaboration for each system between:
- The privacy officer
- The information security officer
- The information officer

### Other Methods to Identify PII

Other examples of methods to identify PII include:
- Reviewing system documentation
- Conducting interviews
- Conducting data calls
- Using data loss prevention technologies (e.g., automated PII network monitoring tools)
- Checking with system and data owners

Organizations should also ensure that retired hardware no longer contains PII and that proper sanitization techniques are applied.

## Examples of PII Data

The following list contains examples of information that may be considered PII:
- **Name**: Full name, maiden name, mother’s maiden name, or alias
- **Personal Identification Number**: Social security number (SSN), passport number, driver’s license number, taxpayer identification number, patient identification number, and financial account or credit card number
- **Address Information**: Street address or email address
- **Asset Information**: Internet Protocol (IP) or Media Access Control (MAC) address or other host-specific persistent static identifier that consistently links to a particular person or small, well-defined group of people
- **Telephone Numbers**: Including mobile, business, and personal numbers
- **Personal Characteristics**: Photographic image (especially of face or other distinguishing characteristic), x-rays, fingerprints, or other biometric image or template data (e.g., retina scan, voice signature, facial geometry)
- **Information Identifying Personally Owned Property**: Vehicle registration number or title number and related information
- **Linked Information**: Information about an individual that is linked or linkable to one of the above (e.g., date of birth, place of birth, race, religion, weight, activities, geographical indicators, employment information, medical information, education information, financial information)

## PII and Fair Information Practices

The protection of PII and the overall privacy of information are concerns both for individuals whose personal information is at stake and for organizations that may be liable or have their reputations damaged should such PII be inappropriately accessed, used, or disclosed.# Privacy and Personal Information

## Introduction
PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is distinct from other types of data because it needs to be not only protected but also collected, maintained, and disseminated in accordance with Federal law. The Privacy Act, as well as other U.S. privacy laws, is based on the widely-recognized Fair Information Practices, also called Privacy Principles.

## Fair Information Practices
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Privacy Guidelines are the most widely-accepted privacy principles, and they were endorsed by the Department of Commerce in 1981. The OECD Fair Information Practices are also the foundation of privacy laws and related policies in many other countries (e.g., Sweden, Australia, Belgium).

In 2004, the Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council issued the Security and Privacy Profile for the Federal Enterprise Architecture that links privacy protection with a set of acceptable privacy principles corresponding to the OECD’s Fair Information Practices.

### The OECD identified the following Fair Information Practices:

1. **Collection Limitation**
There should be limits to the collection of personal data, and any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the data subject.

2. **Data Quality**
Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and kept up-to-date.

3. **Purpose Specification**
The purposes for which personal data are collected should be specified not later than at the time of data collection, and the subsequent use limited to the fulfillment of those purposes or such others as are not incompatible with those purposes and as are specified on each occasion of change of purpose.

4. **Use Limitation**
Personal data should not be disclosed, made available, or otherwise used for purposes other than those specified, except with the consent of the data subject or by the authority of law.

5. **Security Safeguards**
Personal data should be protected by reasonable security safeguards against such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure of data.

6. **Openness**
There should be a general policy of openness about developments, practices, and policies with respect to personal data. Means should be readily available for establishing the existence and nature of personal data, and the main purposes of their use, as well as the identity and usual residence of the data controller.

7. **Individual Participation**
An individual should have the right:
(a) to obtain from a data controller, or otherwise, confirmation of whether or not the data controller has data relating to him;
(b) to have communicated to him, data relating to him within a reasonable time; at a charge, if any, that is not excessive; in a reasonable manner; and in a form that is readily intelligible to him;
(c) to be given reasons if a request made under subparagraphs (a) and (b) is denied, and to be able to challenge such denial; and
(d) to challenge data relating to him and, if the challenge is successful, to have the data corrected.# Privacy and PII Confidentiality

## Accountability
A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures that give effect to the principles stated above.

## Understanding Privacy
Privacy is much broader than just protecting the confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). To establish a comprehensive privacy program that addresses the range of privacy issues that organizations may face, organizations should take steps to establish policies and procedures that address all of the Fair Information Practices.

### Importance of Notice
For example, while providing individuals with notice of new information collections and how their personal information will be used and protected is central to providing individuals with privacy protections and transparency, it may not have a significant impact on protecting the confidentiality of their personal information.

### Fair Information Practices
On the other hand, the Fair Information Practices related to establishing security safeguards, purpose specification, use limitation, collection limitation, and accountability are directly relevant to the protection of the confidentiality of PII. As a result, these principles are highlighted throughout this document as appropriate.

For more information on the Fair Information Practices, see Appendix D.

## PII Confidentiality Impact Levels
This publication focuses on protecting PII from losses of confidentiality. The security objective of confidentiality is defined by law as "preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information."

### Importance of Integrity and Availability
The security objectives of integrity and availability are equally important for PII, and organizations should use the NIST Risk Management Framework to determine the appropriate integrity and availability impact levels. Organizations may also need to consider PII-specific enhancements to the integrity or availability impact levels.

Accuracy is a required Fair Information Practice for most PII, and the security objective of integrity helps to ensure accuracy. Integrity is also important for preventing harm to the individual and the organization. For example, unauthorized alterations of medical records could endanger individuals' lives, and medical mistakes based on inaccurate information can result in liability to the organization and harm to its reputation.

### Determining PII Confidentiality Impact Level
The confidentiality of PII should be protected based on its impact level. This section outlines factors for determining the PII confidentiality impact level for a particular instance of PII, which is distinct from the confidentiality impact level described in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.

The PII confidentiality impact level takes into account additional PII considerations and should be used to determine if additional protections should be implemented. The PII confidentiality impact level—low, moderate, or high—indicates the potential harm that could result to the subject individuals and/or the organization if PII were inappropriately accessed, used, or disclosed.

Once the PII confidentiality impact level is selected, it should be used to supplement the provisional confidentiality impact level.# Security Categorization and Impact Levels

## Overview
Determined from information and system categorization processes outlined in FIPS 199 and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60, Volumes 1 and 2: Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories. Supplementation of the provisional confidentiality impact level should be included in the documentation of the security categorization process.

## Confidentiality of PII
Some Personally Identifiable Information (PII) does not need to have its confidentiality protected, such as information that the organization has permission or authority to release publicly (e.g., an organization publishing a phone directory of employees' names and work phone numbers so that members of the public can contact them directly). In this case, the PII confidentiality impact level would be not applicable and would not be used to supplement a system's provisional confidentiality impact level.

PII that does not require confidentiality protection may still require other security controls to protect the integrity and the availability of the information, and the organization should provide appropriate security controls based on the assigned FIPS 199 impact levels.

## 3.1 Impact Level Definitions
The harm caused from a breach of confidentiality should be considered when attempting to determine which PII confidentiality impact level corresponds to a specific set of PII. For the purposes of this document, harm means any adverse effects that would be experienced by an individual whose PII was the subject of a loss of confidentiality, as well as any adverse effects experienced by the organization that maintains the PII.

### Types of Harm
Harm to an individual includes any negative or unwanted effects (i.e., that may be socially, physically, or financially damaging). Examples of types of harm to individuals include, but are not limited to:
- The potential for blackmail
- Identity theft
- Physical harm
- Discrimination
- Emotional distress

Organizations may also experience harm as a result of a loss of confidentiality of PII maintained by the organization, including but not limited to:
- Administrative burden
- Financial losses
- Loss of public reputation and public confidence
- Legal liability

## Impact Levels Defined in FIPS 199
The following describe the three impact levels—low, moderate, and high—defined in FIPS 199, which are based on the potential impact of a security breach involving a particular system:

### Low Impact Level
The potential impact is LOW if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might:
- Cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced
- Result in minor damage to organizational assets
- Result in minor financial loss
- Result in minor harm to individuals

### Moderate Impact Level
The potential impact is MODERATE if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of...# Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact Levels

## Introduction
The potential impact of loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability can vary significantly. This document outlines the impact levels and factors to consider when assessing the potential harm to organizational operations, assets, and individuals.

## Impact Levels

### Moderate Impact
The potential impact is considered **MODERATE** if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might:
1. Cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced.
2. Result in significant damage to organizational assets.
3. Result in significant financial loss.
4. Result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life-threatening injuries.

### High Impact
The potential impact is considered **HIGH** if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on:
- Organizational operations
- Organizational assets
- Individuals

A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example, the loss might:
1. Cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or more of its primary functions.
2. Result in major damage to organizational assets.
3. Result in major financial loss.
4. Result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of life or serious life-threatening injuries.

## Examples of Harm
Harm to individuals as described in these impact levels can be better understood with examples:
- **Low Impact**: A breach of the confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) would not cause harm greater than inconvenience, such as changing a telephone number.
- **Moderate Impact**: A breach involving PII could lead to financial loss due to identity theft, denial of benefits, public humiliation, discrimination, or the potential for blackmail.
- **High Impact**: Serious physical, social, or financial harm could result, leading to potential loss of life, loss of livelihood, or inappropriate physical detention.

## Factors for Determining PII Confidentiality Impact Levels

### Overview
Determining the impact from a loss of confidentiality of PII should take into account relevant factors. Organizations should consider the following important factors:

1. **Identifiability**: Evaluate how easily PII can be used to identify specific individuals. For example:
- PII data composed of individuals' names, fingerprints, or Social Security Numbers (SSNs) uniquely and directly identify individuals.
- PII data composed of individuals' ZIP codes and dates of birth can indirectly identify individuals.

### Conclusion
It is crucial for organizations to assess these factors collectively, as one factor may indicate a low impact level while another may suggest a high impact level, potentially overriding the first factor. The suggested impact levels are for illustrative purposes; each instance of PII is unique, and organizations should develop policies and procedures that reflect their specific requirements and missions.# PII Confidentiality Impact Levels

## 3.2.1 Identifiability of PII
Data composed of only individuals' area codes and gender usually would not provide for direct or indirect identification of an individual depending upon the context and sample size. Thus, PII that is uniquely and directly identifiable may warrant a higher impact level than PII that is not directly identifiable by itself.

## 3.2.2 Quantity of PII
Organizations may also choose to consider how many individuals are identified in the information (e.g., number of records). Breaches of 25 records and 25 million records may have different impacts, not only in terms of the collective harm to individuals but also in terms of harm to the organization's reputation and the cost to the organization in addressing the breach. For this reason, organizations may choose to set a higher impact level for particularly large PII datasets than would otherwise be set. However, organizations should not set a lower impact level for a PII dataset simply because it contains a small number of records.

## 3.2.3 Data Field Sensitivity
Organizations should evaluate the sensitivity of each individual PII data field, as well as the sensitivity of the PII data fields together. For example, an individual's SSN, medical history, or financial account information is generally considered more sensitive than an individual's phone number or ZIP code. Organizations often require the PII confidentiality impact level to be set at least to moderate if a certain data field, such as SSN, is present. Organizations may also consider certain combinations of PII data fields to be more sensitive, such as name and credit card number, than each data field would be considered without the existence of the others. Data fields may also be considered more sensitive based on potential harm when used in contexts other than their intended use. For example, basic background information, such as place of birth or parent's middle name, is often used as an authentication factor for password recovery at many websites.

## 3.2.4 Context of Use
The context of use factor is related to the Fair Information Practices of Purpose Specification and Use Limitation. Context of use is defined as the purpose for which PII is collected, stored, used, processed, disclosed, or disseminated. Examples of context include, but are not limited to, statistical analysis, eligibility for benefits, administration of benefits, research, tax administration, or law enforcement. Organizations should assess the context of use because it is important in understanding how the disclosure of data elements can potentially harm individuals and the organization. Organizations should also consider whether disclosure of the mere fact that PII is being collected or used could cause harm to the organization or individual. For example, law enforcement investigations could be compromised if the mere fact that information is being collected about a particular individual is disclosed. The context of use factor may cause the same types of PII to be assigned different PII confidentiality impact levels in different instances.# PII Data Confidentiality Considerations

## 3.2.5 Obligation to Protect Confidentiality

An organization that is subject to any obligations to protect PII should consider such obligations when determining the PII confidentiality impact level. Many organizations are subject to laws, regulations, or other mandates governing the obligation to protect personal information, such as:

- The Privacy Act of 1974
- OMB memoranda
- The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)

Additionally, some Federal agencies, such as the Census Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), are subject to additional specific legal obligations to protect certain types of PII. Some organizations are also subject to specific legal requirements based on their role. For example, organizations acting as financial institutions by engaging in financial activities are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). Also, some agencies that collect PII for statistical purposes are subject to the strict confidentiality requirements of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA). Violations of these laws can result in civil or criminal penalties.

Organizations may also be obliged to protect PII by their own policies, standards, or management directives. Decisions regarding the applicability of a particular law, regulation, or other mandate should be made in consultation with an organization’s legal counsel and privacy officer because relevant laws, regulations, and other mandates are often complex and change over time.

## 3.2.6 Access to and Location of PII

Organizations may choose to take into consideration the nature of authorized access to PII. When PII is accessed more often or by more people and systems, there are more opportunities for the confidentiality of the PII to be compromised.

Another aspect of the nature of access to PII is whether PII is being stored on or accessed from teleworkers’ devices or other systems, such as web applications, outside the direct control of the organization. These considerations could cause an organization to assign a higher impact level to widely-accessed PII than would otherwise be assigned to help mitigate the increased risk caused by the nature of the access.

Additionally, organizations may choose to consider whether PII that is stored or regularly transported off-site by employees should be assigned a higher PII confidentiality impact level. For example, surveyors, researchers, and other field employees often need to store PII on laptops or removable media as part of their jobs. Another example is the offsite storage of backup and archive data. PII located offsite could be more vulnerable to unauthorized access or disclosure because it is more likely to be lost or stolen than PII stored on-site.# PII Confidentiality Impact Level Examples

The following examples illustrate how an organization might assign PII confidentiality impact levels to specific instances of PII. The examples are intended to help organizations better understand the process of considering the various impact level factors, and they are not a substitute for organizations analyzing their own situations. Certain circumstances within any organization or specific system, such as the context of use or obligation to protect, may cause different outcomes. Obligation to protect is a particularly important factor that should be determined early in the categorization process. Since obligation to protect confidentiality should always be made in consultation with an organization’s legal counsel and privacy officer, it is not addressed in the following examples.

## Example 1: Incident Response Roster

A Federal government agency maintains an electronic roster of its computer incident response team members. In the event that an IT staff member detects any kind of security breach, standard practice requires that the staff member contact the appropriate people listed on the roster. Because this team may need to coordinate closely in the event of an incident, the contact information includes names, professional titles, office and work cell phone numbers, and work email addresses. The agency makes the same types of contact information available to the public for all of its employees on its main web site.

### Identifiability
The information directly identifies a small number of individuals using names, phone numbers, and email addresses.

### Quantity of PII
The information directly identifies fewer than twenty individuals.

### Data Field Sensitivity
Although the roster is intended to be made available only to the team members, the individuals’ information included in the roster is already available to the public on the agency’s web site.

### Context of Use
The release of the individuals’ names and contact information would not likely cause harm to the individuals, and disclosure of the fact that the agency has collected or used this information is also unlikely to cause harm.

### Access to and Location of PII
The information is accessed by IT staff members who detect security breaches, as well as the team members themselves. The PII needs to be readily available to teleworkers and to on-call IT staff members so that incident responses can be initiated quickly.

Taking into account these factors, the agency determines that unauthorized access to the roster would likely cause little or no harm, and it chooses to assign the PII confidentiality impact level of low.

## Example 2: Intranet Activity Tracking

An organization maintains a web use audit log for an intranet web site accessed by employees. The web use audit log contains the following:

- The user’s IP address
- The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the web site the user was viewing immediately before coming to this web site (i.e., referring URL)
- The date and time the user accessed the web site# Web Access Logs and PII Considerations

## Overview
The web pages or topics accessed within the organization’s website (e.g., organization security policy) are logged for various purposes. This document outlines the considerations regarding the identifiability, quantity of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), data field sensitivity, context of use, and access to PII.

## Identifiability
- The log does not contain directly identifiable data by itself.
- There is a closely-related system with a log that contains domain login information records, including user IDs and corresponding IP addresses.
- Administrators with access to both systems and their logs could potentially correlate information to identify individuals.
- Information could be stored about the actions of most users involving web access to intranet resources.
- A small number of administrators have access to both systems and logs.

## Quantity of PII
- The log contains a large number of records that include linked PII.

## Data Field Sensitivity
- Accessing certain internal web pages could potentially cause embarrassment, especially if the pages involve sensitive subjects (e.g., substance abuse programs).
- The logging is limited to intranet-housed information, minimizing the amount of potentially embarrassing information.

## Context of Use
- The creation of logs is known to all staff members through the organization’s acceptable use policies.
- The release of this information is unlikely to cause harm, aside from potential embarrassment for a small number of users.

## Access to and Location of PII
- The log is accessed by a small number of system administrators for troubleshooting and occasionally by incident response personnel when investigating incidents.
- All access to the log occurs only from the organization’s own systems.

## Confidentiality Impact Level
- Considering the factors above, the organization determines that a breach of the log’s confidentiality would likely cause little or no harm, assigning the PII confidentiality impact level of low.

# Example 3: Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Reporting Application

## Overview
A database contains web form submissions by individuals claiming possible fraud, waste, or abuse of organizational resources and authority. Some submissions include serious allegations, such as accusations of accepting bribes or not enforcing safety regulations.

## Identifiability
- The database does not request PII by default, but a significant percentage of users choose to provide it.
- The web log contains IP addresses, which could be identifiable.
- However, the log information is not linked or readily linkable with the database or other sources to identify specific individuals.

## Quantity of PII
- A recent estimate indicated that the database has approximately 50 records with PII.# PII Confidentiality and Safeguards

## Overview
The database contains nearly 1000 total records, with a focus on the sensitivity of data fields. The narrative text field includes user-supplied information such as names, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.

## Context of Use
Due to the nature of the submissions (reporting claims of fraud, waste, or abuse), disclosing individuals' identities could lead to fear of retribution from management and peers. This could negatively impact individuals who are accused, potentially resulting in:

- Blackmail
- Severe emotional distress
- Loss of employment
- Physical harm

A breach of confidentiality would undermine employee and public trust in the organization.

## Access to and Location of PII
Access to the database is limited to a few individuals investigating fraud, waste, and abuse claims. All access occurs solely from the organization’s internal systems. Given these factors, the organization assesses that a breach of the database's confidentiality could cause catastrophic harm to some individuals, assigning a high confidentiality impact level to PII.

## PII Confidentiality Safeguards
To protect PII, a combination of measures is necessary, including operational safeguards, privacy-specific safeguards, and security controls. Many of these measures align with the Fair Information Practices. Organizations should adopt a risk-based approach to safeguard the confidentiality of PII. The safeguards outlined in this section complement other data protection measures and contribute to a comprehensive strategy for PII confidentiality and the implementation of Fair Information Practices.

### 4.1 Operational Safeguards
This section outlines two types of operational safeguards for PII protection:

1. **Policy and Procedure Creation**
2. **Education, Training, and Awareness**

Organizations can decide whether to integrate these policy, education, and awareness activities with related security controls (e.g., AT-1, AT-2) or to separate them as part of a privacy program.

As agencies establish various safeguards to protect PII confidentiality, they must ensure mechanisms are in place to hold individuals accountable for the effective implementation of these controls. Accountability is a crucial aspect of Fair Information Practices. Agencies may already have established processes for oversight and accountability regarding key controls, such as:

- Information system assessment and authorization
- Privacy Impact Assessments
- Privacy Act compliance

However, additional oversight mechanisms or amendments to existing procedures may be necessary to ensure all measures for protecting PII are considered and properly implemented.

#### 4.1.1 Policy and Procedure Creation
Organizations should develop comprehensive policies and procedures for handling PII at various levels, including:

- Organization level
- Program or component level
- System level (where appropriate)# Privacy Policies and Procedures

## Foundational Privacy Principles
Privacy policies include foundational privacy principles, privacy rules of behavior, policies that implement laws and other mandates, and system-level policies. The foundational privacy principles reflect the organization’s privacy objectives. These principles may also serve as a guide for developing additional policies and procedures.

## Privacy Rules of Behavior
Privacy rules of behavior policies provide guidance on the proper handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as well as the consequences for failure to comply with the policy. Some policies offer guidance on implementing laws and OMB guidance in an organization’s environment based on the organization’s authorized business purposes and mission.

## Recommended Privacy Policy Topics
Organizations should consider developing privacy policies and associated procedures for the following topics:
- Access rules for PII within a system
- PII retention schedules and procedures
- PII incident response and data breach notification
- Privacy in the system development life cycle process
- Limitation of collection, disclosure, sharing, and use of PII
- Consequences for failure to follow privacy rules of behavior

## Interconnected Systems and Agreements
If the organization permits access to or transfer of PII through interconnected systems external to the organization or shares PII through other means, the organization should implement appropriate documented agreements for:
- Roles and responsibilities
- Restrictions on further sharing of the information
- Requirements for notification to each party in the case of a breach
- Minimum security controls
- Other relevant factors

Interconnection Security Agreements (ISA) should be used for technical requirements as necessary. These agreements ensure that partner organizations abide by rules for handling, disclosing, sharing, transmitting, retaining, and using the organization’s PII.

## Incident Response Policies
PII maintained by the organization should also be reflected in the organization’s incident response policies and procedures. A well-defined incident response capability helps the organization:
- Detect incidents rapidly
- Minimize loss and destruction
- Identify weaknesses
- Restore IT operations quickly

OMB M-07-16 sets out specific requirements for reporting incidents involving the loss or inappropriate disclosure of PII. For additional information, see Section 5.

## Awareness, Training, and Education
Awareness, training, and education are distinct activities, each critical to the success of privacy and security programs. Their roles related to protecting PII are briefly described below. Additional information on privacy education, training, and awareness is available in NIST SP 800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program.

### Awareness
Awareness efforts are designed to change behavior or reinforce desired PII practices. The purpose of awareness is to focus attention on the protection of PII. Awareness relies on attention-grabbing techniques to reach all different types of staff across an organization. For PII protection, awareness methods include:
- Informing staff of new scams that are being used to steal identities
- Providing updates on privacy items in the news, such as government data breaches and their effect on individuals and the organization
- Providing examples of how staff members have been held accountable for inappropriate handling of PII# Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

## Training for Staff

The goal of training is to build knowledge and skills that will enable staff to protect PII. Laws and regulations may specifically require training for staff, managers, and contractors. An organization should have a training plan and implementation approach, and an organization’s leadership should communicate the seriousness of protecting PII to its staff.

### Organizational Policy

Organizational policy should define:
- Roles and responsibilities for training
- Training prerequisites for receiving access to PII
- Training periodicity and refresher training requirements

To reduce the possibility that PII will be accessed, used, or disclosed inappropriately, all individuals that have been granted access to PII should receive appropriate training and, where applicable, specific role-based training.

### Important Topics to Address

Depending on the roles and functions involving PII, important topics to address may include:
- The definition of PII
- Applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies
- Restrictions on data collection, storage, and use of PII
- Roles and responsibilities for using and protecting PII
- Appropriate disposal of PII
- Sanctions for misuse of PII
- Recognition of a security or privacy incident involving PII
- Retention schedules for PII
- Roles and responsibilities in responding to PII-related incidents and reporting

Education develops a common body of knowledge that reflects all of the various specialties and aspects of PII protection. It is used to develop privacy professionals who are able to implement privacy programs that enable their organizations to proactively respond to privacy challenges.

## Privacy-Specific Safeguards

Privacy-specific safeguards are controls for protecting the confidentiality of PII. These controls provide types of protections not usually needed for other types of data. Privacy-specific safeguards help organizations collect, maintain, use, and disseminate data in ways that protect the confidentiality of the data.

### Minimizing the Use, Collection, and Retention of PII

The practice of minimizing the use, collection, and retention of PII is a basic privacy principle. By limiting PII collections to the least amount necessary to conduct its mission, the organization may limit potential negative consequences in the event of a data breach involving PII.

Organizations should consider:
- The total amount of PII used, collected, and maintained
- The types and categories of PII used, collected, and maintained

This general concept is often abbreviated as the “minimum necessary” principle. PII collections should only be made where such collections are essential to meet the authorized business purpose and mission of the organization. If the PII serves no current business purpose, then the PII should no longer be used or collected.

Additionally, an organization should regularly review its holdings of previously collected PII to determine whether the PII is still relevant and necessary for meeting the organization’s business purpose and mission. If PII is no longer relevant and necessary, then PII should be properly destroyed. The destruction or disposal of PII must be conducted in accordance with any applicable regulations.# Privacy and Information Management

## 4.2.1 Management of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Organizations must adhere to litigation holds, the Federal Records Act, and records control schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). It is crucial to ensure that retired hardware is properly sanitized before disposal, ensuring that no disk images contain PII and that hard drives have been adequately sanitized.

Effective management and prompt disposal of PII, in accordance with NARA-approved disposition schedules, will minimize the risk of unauthorized disclosure.

## 4.2.2 Conducting Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)

Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) are structured processes designed to identify and mitigate privacy risks, including risks to confidentiality within an information system. According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), PIAs are:

- Structured reviews of how information is handled to ensure compliance with applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements.
- Assessments to determine the risks and effects of collecting, maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable form within an electronic information system.
- Evaluations to identify and assess protections and alternative processes for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.

When used effectively, a PIA should address confidentiality risks at every stage of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Many organizations have developed their own templates to facilitate the PIA process. Common topics addressed in a PIA include:

- What information is to be collected
- Why the information is being collected
- The intended use of the information
- With whom the information will be shared
- How the information will be secured
- What choices the agency made regarding an IT system or collection of information as a result of performing the PIA

## 4.2.3 De-Identifying Information

Full data records are not always necessary for certain activities, such as research, resource planning, and examinations of correlations and trends. The term **de-identified information** refers to records that have had sufficient PII removed or obscured (also known as masked or obfuscated) so that the remaining information does not identify an individual, and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual.

De-identified information can be re-identified (rendered distinguishable) using a code, algorithm, or pseudonym assigned to individual records. The code, algorithm, or pseudonym should not be derived from other related information about the individual, and the means of re-identification should only be known by authorized parties and not disclosed to anyone without the authority to re-identify records.

A common technique for de-identification is to use a one-way cryptographic function, also known as a hash function, on the PII. De-identified information can be assigned a PII confidentiality impact level of low, provided that the following conditions are met:

- The re-identification algorithm, code, or pseudonym is maintained in a separate system, with appropriate controls in place to prevent unauthorized access to the re-identification information.# Identification Information

- The data elements are not linkable, via public records or other reasonably available external records, in order to re-identify the data.

## De-identification

For example, de-identification could be accomplished by removing account numbers, names, SSNs, and any other identifiable information from a set of financial records. By de-identifying the information, a trend analysis team could perform an unbiased review on those records in the system without compromising the PII or providing the team with the ability to identify any individual.

Another example is using health care test results in research analysis. All of the identifying PII fields can be removed, and the patient ID numbers can be obscured using pseudo-random data that is associated with a cross-reference table located in a separate system. The only means to reconstruct the original (complete) PII records is through authorized access to the cross-reference table.

Additionally, de-identified information can be aggregated for the purposes of statistical analysis, such as making comparisons, analyzing trends, or identifying patterns. An example is the aggregation and use of multiple sets of de-identified data for evaluating several types of education loan programs. The data describes characteristics of loan holders, such as age, gender, region, and outstanding loan balances. With this dataset, an analyst could draw statistics showing that 18,000 women in the 30-35 age group have outstanding loan balances greater than $10,000. Although the original dataset contained distinguishable identities for each person, the de-identified and aggregated dataset would not contain linked or readily identifiable data for any individual.

## Anonymizing Information

Anonymized information is defined as previously identifiable information that has been de-identified and for which a code or other association for re-identification no longer exists. Anonymizing information usually involves the application of statistical disclosure limitation techniques to ensure the data cannot be re-identified, such as:

- **Generalizing the Data**—Making information less precise, such as grouping continuous values.
- **Suppressing the Data**—Deleting an entire record or certain parts of records.
- **Introducing Noise into the Data**—Adding small amounts of variation into selected data.
- **Swapping the Data**—Exchanging certain data fields of one record with the same data fields of another similar record (e.g., swapping the ZIP codes of two records).
- **Replacing Data with the Average Value**—Replacing a selected value of data with the average value for the entire group of data.

Using these techniques, the information is no longer PII, but it can retain its useful and realistic properties.

Anonymized information is useful for system testing. Systems that are newly developed, newly purchased, or upgraded require testing before being introduced to their intended production (or live) environment. Testing generally should simulate real conditions as closely as possible to ensure the new or upgraded system runs correctly and handles the projected system capacity effectively. If PII is used in the test environment, it is required to be protected at the same level that it...# Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

## Introduction
In the production environment, protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) can significantly increase the time and expense of testing systems.

## Challenges with Fake Data
Randomly generating fake data to replace PII for testing purposes is often ineffective. This is because certain properties and statistical distributions of PII may need to be retained to effectively test the system.

## Anonymizing PII
There are tools available that substitute PII with synthetic data generated by anonymizing PII. The anonymized information retains the useful properties of the original PII, but it is not considered PII. Anonymized data substitution is a privacy-specific protection measure that enables system testing while reducing the expense and added time of protecting PII. However, it is important to note that not all data can be readily anonymized (e.g., biometric data).

## Security Controls
In addition to the PII-specific safeguards described earlier, many types of security controls are available to safeguard the confidentiality of PII. Providing reasonable security safeguards is also a Fair Information Practice.

### General Security Controls
Security controls are often already implemented on a system to protect other types of data processed, stored, or transmitted by the system. The security controls listed in NIST SP 800-53 address general protections of data and systems. Below are some of the NIST SP 800-53 controls that can be used to help safeguard the confidentiality of PII:

- **Access Enforcement (AC-3)**: Organizations can control access to PII through access control policies and enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists). This can be achieved in various ways, such as implementing role-based access control, where each user can access only the data necessary for their role. Another method is to restrict user access to PII through an application that limits their access, rather than allowing direct access to databases or files containing PII. Encrypting stored information is also an option for implementing access enforcement. OMB M-07-16 specifies that Federal agencies must encrypt all data on mobile computers/devices carrying agency data unless the data is determined not to be sensitive, in writing, by a senior-level individual.

- **Separation of Duties (AC-5)**: Organizations can enforce separation of duties for roles involving access to PII. For example, users of de-identified PII data should not also hold roles that permit access to the original PII.

## Conclusion
Organizations may choose to provide greater protections than what is recommended in NIST SP 800-53. It is essential to consider various factors when choosing the appropriate controls to protect PII effectively. In addition to the controls listed, NIST SP 800-53 contains many other controls that can be used to help protect PII, such as incident response controls.# Access Control Measures for PII

## Least Privilege (AC-6)
Organizations can enforce the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or accesses needed by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) for the performance of specified tasks. Concerning PII, the organization can ensure that users who must access records containing PII only have access to the minimum amount of PII, along with only those privileges (e.g., read, write, execute) that are necessary to perform their job duties.

## Remote Access (AC-17)
Organizations can choose to prohibit or strictly limit remote access to PII. If remote access is permitted, the organization should ensure that the communications are encrypted.

## User-Based Collaboration and Information Sharing (AC-21)
Organizations can provide automated mechanisms to assist users in determining whether access authorizations match access restrictions, such as contractually-based restrictions, for PII.

## Access Control for Mobile Devices (AC-19)
Organizations can choose to prohibit or strictly limit access to PII from portable and mobile devices, such as laptops, cell phones, and personal digital assistants (PDA), which are generally higher-risk than non-portable devices (e.g., desktop computers at the organization’s facilities). Some organizations may choose to restrict remote access involving higher-impact instances of PII so that the information will not leave the organization’s physical boundaries. If access is permitted, the organization can ensure that the devices are properly secured and regularly scan the devices to verify their security status (e.g., anti-malware software enabled and up-to-date, operating system fully patched).

## Auditable Events (AU-2)
Organizations can monitor events that affect the confidentiality of PII, such as unauthorized access to PII.

## Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting (AU-6)
Organizations can regularly review and analyze information system audit records for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity affecting PII, investigate suspicious activity or suspected violations, report findings to appropriate officials, and take necessary actions.

## Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users) (IA-2)
Users can be uniquely identified and authenticated before accessing PII. The strength requirement for the authentication mechanism depends on the impact level of the PII and the system as a whole. OMB M-07-16 specifies that Federal agencies must "allow remote access only with two-factor authentication where one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the computer gaining access," and also must "use a 'time-out' function for remote access and mobile devices requiring user re-authentication after thirty minutes of inactivity."

## Media Access (MP-2)
Organizations can restrict access to information system media containing PII, including digital media (e.g., CDs, USB flash drives, backup tapes) and non-digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). This could also include portable and mobile devices with a storage capability.

## Media Marking (MP-3)
Organizations can label information system media and...# Handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

## 1. PII Distribution and Handling
Organizations must indicate how PII should be distributed and handled. Specific types of media or output may be exempt from labeling as long as they remain within a secure environment. Examples of labeling include:
- Cover sheets on printouts
- Paper labels on digital media

## 2. Media Storage (MP-4)
Organizations can securely store PII in both paper and digital forms until the media are destroyed or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures. An example includes:
- Use of storage encryption technologies to protect PII stored on removable media.

## 3. Media Transport (MP-5)
Organizations can protect digital and non-digital media and mobile devices containing PII that are transported outside the organization’s controlled areas. Examples of protective safeguards include:
- Encrypting stored information
- Locking the media in a container

## 4. Media Sanitization (MP-6)
Organizations can sanitize digital and non-digital media containing PII before disposal or release for reuse. An example is:
- Degaussing a hard drive, which involves applying a magnetic field to render it unusable.

## 5. Transmission Confidentiality (SC-9)
Organizations can protect the confidentiality of transmitted PII, typically accomplished by:
- Encrypting communications
- Encrypting the information before transmission

## 6. Protection of Information at Rest (SC-28)
Organizations can protect the confidentiality of PII at rest, referring to information stored on secondary storage devices, such as hard drives or backup tapes. This is usually achieved by:
- Encrypting the stored information.

## 7. Information System Monitoring (SI-4)
Organizations can employ automated tools to monitor PII internally or at network boundaries for unusual or suspicious transfers or events. An example includes:
- Use of data loss prevention technologies.

## 8. Incident Response for Breaches Involving PII
Handling incidents and breaches involving PII differs from regular incident handling and may require additional actions by an organization. Breaches involving PII can attract considerable media attention, potentially harming an organization’s reputation and reducing public trust. Affected individuals may face embarrassment, identity theft, or blackmail due to such breaches.

### 8.1 Additional Policies
Organizations should develop additional policies that address:
- When and how individuals should be notified
- When and if a breach should be reported publicly
- Whether to provide remedial services, such as credit monitoring, to affected individuals

These policies should be integrated into existing incident handling response policies.

### 8.2 Coordination and Roles
Management of incidents involving PII often requires close coordination among personnel across the organization, including:
- Chief Information Officer (CIO)
- Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)
- System owner
- Data owner
- Legal counsel
- Public relations officer

To ensure effective management during an incident, organizations should establish clear roles and responsibilities.

### 8.3 Compliance
FISMA requires Federal agencies to have procedures for handling information.# Security Incident Handling and PII Considerations

The document discusses the handling of security incidents, particularly those involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It outlines the guidance provided by various organizations and the necessary steps for effective incident response.

## Overview

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed the establishment of a central Federal information security incident center, known as the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Additionally, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provided guidance on security incident handling in **NIST SP 800-61 Revision 1**, titled *Computer Security Incident Handling Guide*.

In 2007, OMB issued **M-07-16**, which provided specific guidance to Federal agencies for handling incidents involving PII.

## Incident Response Plans

Incident response plans should be modified to handle breaches involving PII. These plans should also address how to minimize the amount of PII necessary to adequately report and respond to a breach.

NIST SP 800-61 Revision 1 describes four phases of handling security incidents. Specific policies and procedures for handling breaches involving PII can be added to each of the following phases:

1. Preparation
2. Detection and Analysis
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
4. Post-Incident Activity

This section provides additional details on PII-specific considerations for each of these four phases.

### 5.1 Preparation

Preparation requires the most effort because it sets the stage to ensure the breach is handled appropriately. Organizations should build their response plans for breaches involving PII into their existing incident response plans.

The development of response plans for breaches involving PII requires organizations to make many decisions about how to handle such breaches, which should be used to develop policies and procedures. These policies and procedures should be communicated to the organization’s entire staff through training and awareness programs.

#### Training and Awareness

Training may include tabletop exercises to simulate an incident and test whether the response plan is effective and whether the staff members understand and are able to perform their roles effectively. Training programs should also inform employees of the consequences of their actions regarding inappropriate use and handling of PII.

#### Incident Reporting

The organization should determine if existing processes are adequate, and if not, establish a new incident reporting method for employees to report suspected or known incidents involving PII. The method could be a phone hotline, email, online form, or a management reporting structure in which employees know to contact a specific person within the management chain.

Employees should be able to report any breach involving PII immediately, at any time. Additionally, employees should be provided with a clear definition of what constitutes a breach involving PII and what information needs to be reported.

#### Information to Collect

The following information is helpful to obtain from employees who are reporting a known or suspected breach involving PII:

- Person reporting the incident
- Person who discovered the incident
- Date and time the incident was discovered
- Nature of the incident
- Name of the system and possible interconnectivity with other systems
- Description of the information lost or compromised
- Storage medium from which information was lost or compromised# Breach Notification and Incident Handling Guidelines

## Introduction
Organizations must have controls in place to prevent unauthorized use of lost or compromised information. This includes:

- **Controls in place to prevent unauthorized use of the lost or compromised information**
- **Number of individuals potentially affected**
- **Whether law enforcement was contacted**

Federal agencies are required to report all known or suspected breaches involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to US-CERT within one hour. To meet this obligation, organizations should proactively plan their breach notification response.

## Breach Notification Planning
A breach involving PII may require notification to various external parties, including:

- Law enforcement
- Financial institutions
- Affected individuals
- The media
- The public

Organizations should plan in advance how, when, and to whom notifications should be made. Training sessions on interacting with the media regarding incidents should also be conducted.

### OMB M-07-16 Requirements
OMB M-07-16 requires federal agencies to include the following elements in their plans for handling breach notification:

- Whether breach notification to affected individuals is required
- Timeliness of the notification
- Source of the notification
- Contents of the notification
- Means of providing the notification
- Who receives the notification; public outreach response
- What actions were taken and by whom

Organizations should establish a committee or designate a person responsible for coordinating the organization’s response using the breach notification policy. Additionally, organizations need to determine how incidents involving PII will be tracked.

### Remedial Assistance
Organizations should determine what circumstances require providing remedial assistance to affected individuals, such as credit monitoring services. The PII confidentiality impact level should be considered for this determination, as it provides an analysis of the likelihood of harm from the loss of confidentiality for each instance of PII.

## 5.2 Detection and Analysis
Organizations may continue to use their current detection and analysis technologies and techniques for handling incidents involving PII. However, adjustments to incident handling processes may be necessary, such as ensuring that the analysis process includes an evaluation of whether an incident involves PII.

Detection and analysis should focus on both known and suspected breaches involving PII. Detection of an incident involving PII also requires reporting internally, to US-CERT, and externally, as appropriate.

## 5.3 Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
Existing technologies and techniques for containment, eradication, and recovery may be used for breaches involving PII. However, changes to incident handling processes may be necessary, such as performing additional media sanitization steps when PII needs to be deleted from media during recovery.

PII should not be sanitized until a determination has been made about whether the PII must be preserved as evidence. Particular attention should be paid to using proper forensics techniques to ensure the preservation of evidence. Additionally, it is important to determine whether PII was accessed and how many records or individuals were affected.

## 5.4 Post-Incident Activity
*Details on post-incident activities were not provided in the current text.*# Incident Response and Lessons Learned

As with other security incidents, information learned through detection, analysis, containment, and recovery should be collected for sharing within the organization and with the US-CERT to help protect against future incidents.

## Updating the Incident Response Plan

The incident response plan should be continually updated and improved based on the lessons learned during each incident.

### Training and Security Controls

Lessons learned might also indicate the need for additional training, security controls, or procedures to protect against future incidents.

## Providing Remedial Assistance

Additionally, the organization should use its response policy, developed during the planning phase, to determine whether the organization should provide affected individuals with remedial assistance.
