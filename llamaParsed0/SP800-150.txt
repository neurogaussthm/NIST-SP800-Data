# Cyber Threat Information Sharing Guidelines

## Abstract
Cyber threat information is any information that can help an organization identify, assess, monitor, and respond to cyber threats. Cyber threat information includes indicators of compromise; tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors; suggested actions to detect, contain, or prevent attacks; and the findings from the analyses of incidents. Organizations that share cyber threat information can improve their own security postures as well as those of other organizations.

This publication provides guidelines for establishing and participating in cyber threat information sharing relationships. This guidance helps organizations establish information sharing goals, identify cyber threat information sources, scope information sharing activities, develop rules that control the publication and distribution of threat information, engage with existing sharing communities, and make effective use of threat information in support of the organization’s overall cybersecurity practices.

## Executive Summary
Cyber attacks have increased in frequency and sophistication, presenting significant challenges for organizations that must defend their data and systems from capable threat actors. These actors range from individual, autonomous attackers to well-resourced groups operating in a coordinated manner as part of a criminal enterprise or on behalf of a nation-state. Threat actors can be persistent, motivated, and agile, and they use a variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to compromise systems, disrupt services, commit financial fraud, and expose or steal intellectual property and other sensitive information. Given the risks these threats present, it is increasingly important that organizations share cyber threat information and use it to improve their security posture.

Cyber threat information is any information that can help an organization identify, assess, monitor, and respond to cyber threats. Examples of cyber threat information include indicators (system artifacts or observables associated with an attack), TTPs, security alerts, threat intelligence reports, and recommended security tool configurations. Most organizations already produce multiple types of cyber threat information that are available to share internally as part of their information technology and security operations efforts.

By exchanging cyber threat information within a sharing community, organizations can leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and capabilities of that sharing community to gain a more complete understanding of the threats the organization may face. Using this knowledge, an organization can make threat-informed decisions regarding defensive capabilities, threat detection techniques, and mitigation strategies. By correlating and analyzing cyber threat information from multiple sources, an organization can also enrich existing information and make it more actionable. This enrichment may be achieved by independently confirming the observations of other community members, and by improving the overall quality of the threat information through the reduction of ambiguity and errors.# Cyber Threat Information Sharing Guidelines

## Introduction
Threat information sharing is crucial for organizations to remediate threats and protect against the spread of cyber threats. By sharing cyber threat information, organizations can enhance their ability to detect campaigns targeting specific industry sectors, business entities, or institutions.

## Purpose of the Publication
This publication aims to assist organizations in establishing and participating in cyber threat information sharing relationships. It outlines the benefits and challenges of sharing, emphasizes the importance of trust, and introduces specific data handling considerations. The goal is to provide guidelines that improve cybersecurity operations and risk management activities through safe and effective information sharing practices.

## Recommendations for Effective Information Sharing

### 1. Establish Information Sharing Goals and Objectives
Organizations should define information sharing goals and objectives that align with their business processes and security policies. These goals should advance the overall cybersecurity strategy and help manage cyber-related risks effectively. Utilizing the combined knowledge and experience of personnel and members of cyber threat information sharing organizations is essential while adhering to security, privacy, regulatory, and legal compliance requirements.

### 2. Identify Existing Internal Sources of Cyber Threat Information
Organizations need to identify tools, sensors, and repositories that collect, produce, or store cyber threat information. This includes threat analytics platforms and delivery mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of cyber threat information. As internal sources are identified, organizations should assess how this information supports cybersecurity and risk management activities, document knowledge gaps, and consider acquiring additional threat information from external sources or deploying new tools or sensors. It is also important to identify threat information that is suitable for sharing with outside parties.

### 3. Specify the Scope of Information Sharing Activities
The scope of an organization’s information sharing activities should align with its resources, abilities, and objectives. Efforts should focus on activities that provide the greatest value to the organization and its sharing partners. This scoping activity should identify the types of information authorized for sharing by key stakeholders, the circumstances under which sharing is permitted, and the parties with whom the information can and should be shared.

## Conclusion
NIST encourages greater sharing of cyber threat information among organizations to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of information sharing capabilities. By implementing these recommendations, organizations can improve their cybersecurity posture and better manage risks associated with cyber threats.# Establish Information Sharing Rules

## Purpose of Sharing Rules
Sharing rules are intended to control the publication and distribution of threat information, and consequently help to prevent the dissemination of information that, if improperly disclosed, may have adverse consequences for an organization, its customers, or its business partners.

## Considerations for Sharing Rules
Information sharing rules should take into consideration:
- The trustworthiness of the recipient
- The sensitivity of the shared information
- The potential impact of sharing (or not sharing) specific types of information

# Join and Participate in Information Sharing Efforts
An organization should identify and participate in sharing activities that complement its existing threat information capabilities.

## Participation in Multiple Forums
An organization may need to participate in multiple information sharing forums to meet its operational needs. Organizations should consider:
- Public and private sharing communities
- Government repositories
- Commercial cyber threat information feeds
- Open sources such as public websites, blogs, and data feeds

# Actively Seek to Enrich Indicators
When possible, organizations should increase the usefulness and effectiveness of threat information by producing metadata for each indicator that is generated.

## Importance of Metadata
Such metadata can provide context regarding the indicator by:
- Describing the intended use of the indicator
- Explaining how it is to be interpreted
- Relating it to other indicators

## Feedback Mechanisms
Additionally, sharing processes should include mechanisms for:
- Publishing indicators
- Updating indicators and associated metadata
- Retracting submissions that are incorrect or perhaps inadvertently shared

Such feedback plays an important role in the enrichment, maturation, and quality of the indicators shared within a community.

# Use Secure, Automated Workflows
The use of standardized data formats and transport protocols to share cyber threat information makes it easier to automate threat information processing.

## Benefits of Automation
The use of automation enables cyber threat information to be:
- Rapidly shared
- Transformed
- Enriched
- Analyzed
- Acted upon with less need for manual intervention

# Proactively Establish Cyber Threat Sharing Agreements
Rather than attempting to establish sharing agreements during an active cyber incident, organizations should plan ahead and have agreements in place before incidents occur.

## Importance of Advanced Planning
Such advanced planning helps ensure that participating organizations:
- Establish trusted relationships
- Understand their roles, responsibilities, and information handling requirements

# Protect the Security and Privacy of Sensitive Information
Sensitive information such as controlled unclassified information (CUI) and personally identifiable information (PII) may be encountered when handling cyber threat information.

## Risks of Improper Disclosure
The improper disclosure of such information could lead to:
- Financial loss
- Violation of laws, regulations, and contracts
- Legal action
- Damage to an organization’s or individual’s reputation

Accordingly, organizations should take necessary precautions to protect sensitive information.# Cyber Threat Information Sharing Guidance

## 2. Basics of Cyber Threat Information Sharing
This section introduces basic cyber threat information sharing concepts including types of cyber threat information and common terminology. The section also examines potential uses for...# Shared Cyber Threat Information

This document explores the benefits and challenges of threat information sharing.

## 2.1 Threat Information Types

A cyber threat is defined as "any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or denial of service." For brevity, this publication uses the term **threat** instead of **cyber threat**. The individuals and groups posing threats are known as **threat actors** or simply **actors**.

Threat information is any information related to a threat that might help an organization protect itself against a threat or detect the activities of an actor. Major types of threat information include the following:

### Indicators

Indicators are technical artifacts or observables that suggest an attack is imminent, currently underway, or that a compromise may have already occurred. Indicators can be used to detect and defend against potential threats. Examples of indicators include:
- The Internet Protocol (IP) address of a suspected command and control server
- A suspicious Domain Name System (DNS) domain name
- A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that references malicious content
- A file hash for a malicious executable
- The subject line text of a malicious email message

### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) describe the behavior of an actor.
- **Tactics** are high-level descriptions of behavior.
- **Techniques** are detailed descriptions of behavior in the context of a tactic.
- **Procedures** are even lower-level, highly detailed descriptions in the context of a technique.

TTPs could describe an actor’s tendency to use a specific malware variant, order of operations, attack tool, delivery mechanism (e.g., phishing or watering hole attack), or exploit.

### Security Alerts

Security alerts, also known as advisories, bulletins, and vulnerability notes, are brief, usually human-readable, technical notifications regarding current vulnerabilities, exploits, and other security issues. Security alerts originate from sources such as:
- The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)
- Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)
- The National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs)
- Commercial security service providers
- Security researchers

### Threat Intelligence Reports

Threat intelligence reports are generally prose documents that describe TTPs, actors, types of systems and information being targeted, and other threat-related information that provides greater situational awareness to an organization. Threat intelligence is threat information that has been aggregated, transformed, analyzed, interpreted, or enriched to provide the necessary context for decision-making processes.

### Tool Configurations

Tool configurations are recommendations for setting up and using tools (mechanisms) that support the automated collection, exchange, processing, analysis, and use of threat information. For example, tool configuration information could consist of instructions on how to install and configure security tools.# Threat Information Sharing

## Introduction
Organizations often utilize rootkit detection and removal utilities, customize intrusion detection signatures, and configure router access control lists (ACLs), firewall rules, or web filter configuration files. Many organizations already produce and share threat information internally. For example, an organization’s security team may identify malicious files on a compromised system when responding to an incident and produce an associated set of indicators (e.g., file names, sizes, hash values). These indicators might then be shared with system administrators who configure security tools, such as host-based intrusion detection systems, to detect the presence of these indicators on other systems. Likewise, the security team may launch an email security awareness initiative in response to an observed rise in phishing attacks within the organization. These practices demonstrate information sharing within an organization.

The primary goal of this publication is to foster similar threat information sharing practices across organizational boundaries—both acquiring threat information from other organizations and providing internally-generated threat information to other organizations.

## 2.2 Benefits of Information Sharing
Threat information sharing provides access to threat information that might otherwise be unavailable to an organization. Using shared resources, organizations can enhance their security posture by leveraging the knowledge, experience, and capabilities of their partners in a proactive way. Allowing “one organization’s detection to become another’s prevention” is a powerful paradigm that can advance the overall security of organizations that actively share threat information.

An organization can use shared threat information in many ways. Some uses are operationally oriented, such as updating enterprise security controls for continuous monitoring with new indicators and configurations to detect the latest attacks and compromises. Threat information may also be used strategically, such as using shared threat information as inputs when planning major changes to an organization’s security architecture.

Threat information exchanged within communities organized around specific industries or sectors (or some other shared characteristic) can be particularly beneficial because the member organizations often face actors that use common TTPs that target the same types of systems and information. Cyber defense is most effective when organizations work together to deter and defend against well-organized, capable actors. Such collaboration helps to reduce risk and improve the organization’s security posture.

### Benefits of Information Sharing
- **Shared Situational Awareness:** Information sharing enables organizations to leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and analytic capabilities of their sharing partners within a community of interest, thereby enhancing the defensive capabilities of multiple organizations. Even a single contribution—a new indicator or observation about an actor—can increase the awareness and security of an entire community.

- **Improved Security Posture:** By developing and sharing threat information, organizations gain a...# Understanding the Threat Environment

Organizations can gain a better understanding of the threat environment and utilize threat information to inform their cybersecurity and risk management practices. By sharing information, organizations can:

- Identify affected platforms or systems
- Implement protective measures
- Enhance detection capabilities
- More effectively respond and recover from incidents based on observed changes in the threat environment

As organizations share information and mitigate threats, they can improve their overall cybersecurity posture. This not only protects themselves but also provides a degree of protection to other organizations, including those that may not have responded to the threat information, by reducing the number of viable attack vectors for malicious actors.

## Knowledge Maturation

When seemingly unrelated observations are shared and analyzed by organizations, those observations can be correlated with data collected by others. This enrichment process increases the value of information by:

- Enhancing existing indicators
- Developing knowledge of actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with specific incidents, threats, or threat campaigns

Correlation can also provide valuable insights into the relationships that exist between indicators.

## Greater Defensive Agility

Actors continually adapt their TTPs to evade detection, circumvent security controls, and exploit new vulnerabilities. Organizations that share information are often better informed about changing TTPs and the need to rapidly detect and respond to threats. This awareness helps to:

- Increase operational tempo
- Reduce the probability of successful attacks

Such agility also creates economies of scale for network defenders while increasing the costs for malicious actors by forcing them to develop new TTPs.

# Challenges to Information Sharing

While sharing threat information has clear benefits, certain challenges remain. Some challenges that apply to both consuming and producing threat information include:

## Establishing Trust

Trust relationships form the basis for information sharing but require effort to establish and maintain. Ongoing communication through regular in-person meetings, phone calls, or social media can help accelerate the process of building trust.

## Achieving Interoperability and Automation

Standardized data formats and transport protocols are important building blocks for interoperability. The use of common formats and protocols enables automation and allows organizations, repositories, and tools to exchange threat information at machine speed. However, adopting specific formats and protocols can require significant time and resources, and the value of these investments can be substantially reduced if sharing partners require different formats or protocols. During the standards development process, early adopters need to accept the risk that it may be necessary to purchase new tools if significant changes to formats and protocols occur.

## Safeguarding Sensitive Information

Disclosure of sensitive information, such as controlled unclassified information (CUI) and personally identifiable information (PII), can result in financial and reputational risks.# Information Sharing Challenges

## Risks of Information Sharing
- Loss, violation of sharing agreements, legal action, and loss of reputation.
- Sharing security and event information, such as security logs or scan results, could expose the protective or detective capabilities of the organization and result in threat shifting by the actor.
- Unauthorized disclosure of information may impede or disrupt an ongoing investigation, jeopardize information needed for future legal proceedings, or disrupt response actions such as botnet takedown operations.
- Organizations should apply handling designations to shared information and implement policies, procedures, and technical controls to actively manage the risks of disclosure of sensitive information.

## Protecting Classified Information
- Information received from government sources may be marked as classified, making it difficult for an organization to use.
- Acquiring and maintaining the clearances needed for ongoing access to classified information sources is expensive and time-consuming for organizations.
- Many organizations employ non-U.S. citizens who are not eligible to hold security clearances and are not permitted access to classified information.

## Enabling Information Consumption and Publication
- Organizations that want to consume and publish threat information need to have the necessary infrastructure, tools, personnel, and training to do so.
- Information sharing initiatives should be carefully scoped, as high-frequency, high-volume information exchanges have the potential to overwhelm an organization’s processing capabilities.
- Organizations that are currently unable to support automated indicator exchange can explore other options such as the manual exchange of best practices or summary indicator information.
- As additional resources become available, an organization may decide to use automated tools and workflows to process and use threat information.

## Challenges in Consuming Threat Information
### Accessing External Information
- Organizations need the infrastructure to access external sources and incorporate the information retrieved from external sources into local decision-making processes.
- Information received from external sources has value only to the extent that an organization is equipped to act on the information.

### Evaluating the Quality of Received Information
- Before acting on threat information, an organization needs to confirm that the information is correct, that the threat is relevant, and that the risks of using or not using the information (i.e., potential impacts of action vs. inaction) are well understood.

## Challenges in Providing Information to Other Organizations
### Complying with Legal and Organizational Requirements
- An organization’s executive and legal teams may restrict the types of information that the organization can provide to others.
- Such restrictions may include limits on the types of information and the level of technical detail provided.
- These safeguards are appropriate when they address legitimate business, legal, or privacy concerns.# Information Sharing Guidelines

## Introduction
The imposition of unwarranted or arbitrary restrictions may diminish the utility, availability, quality, and timeliness of shared information.

### Limiting Attribution
Organizations may openly participate in information sharing communities but still require that their contributions remain anonymous. Unattributed information sharing may allow an organization to share more information because there is less perceived risk to the organization’s reputation. However, the lack of attribution may limit the usefulness of the information because users may have less confidence in information that originates from an unknown source. If the original sources of information cannot be identified, organizations may be unable to confirm that information has been received from multiple independent sources, thus reducing an organization’s ability to build confidence in received information.

## Establishing Sharing Relationships
When launching a threat information sharing capability, the following planning and preparation activities are recommended:

1. **Define the goals and objectives of information sharing** (section 3.1).
2. **Identify internal sources of threat information** (section 3.2).
3. **Define the scope of information sharing activities** (section 3.3).
4. **Establish information sharing rules** (section 3.4).
5. **Join a sharing community** (section 3.5).
6. **Plan to provide ongoing support for information sharing activities** (section 3.6).

Throughout this process, organizations are encouraged to consult with subject matter experts both inside and outside their organization. Such sources include:
- Experienced cybersecurity personnel,
- Members and operators of established threat information sharing organizations,
- Trusted business associates, supply chain partners, and industry peers, and
- Personnel knowledgeable about legal issues, internal business processes, procedures, and systems.

An organization should use the knowledge and experience from these experts to help shape a threat information sharing capability that supports its mission and operates under its security, privacy, regulatory, and legal compliance requirements. Due to constantly changing risks, requirements, priorities, technology, and/or regulations, this process will often be iterative. Organizations should reassess and adjust their information sharing capabilities as needed based on changing circumstances. Such a change may involve repeating some or all of the planning and preparation activities listed above.

## 3.1 Define Information Sharing Goals and Objectives
At the outset, an organization should establish goals and objectives that describe the desired outcomes of threat information sharing in terms of the organization’s business processes and security policies. These goals and objectives will help guide the organization through the process of scoping its information sharing efforts, selecting and joining sharing communities, and providing ongoing support for information sharing activities. Due to technological and/or resource constraints, it may be necessary to prioritize goals and objectives to ensure that the most important information sharing activities are performed.

## 3.2 Identify Internal Sources of Cyber Threat Information
(Section content not provided in the original text.)# Identifying Threat Information Sources

A key step in any information sharing effort is to identify potential sources of threat information within an organization. By conducting an inventory of internal threat information sources, an organization is better able to identify knowledge gaps. These gaps can be addressed by deploying additional tools and sensors or by acquiring threat information from external threat information feeds or repositories. In large organizations, this inventory process is also a means of discovering information that is being collected and analyzed in business units across the organization that may not be currently shared within the organization.

## Steps to Identify Threat Information Sources

The process of identifying threat information sources includes the following steps:

1. **Identify Sensors, Tools, Data Feeds, and Repositories**
Confirm that the information is produced at a frequency, precision, and accuracy to support cybersecurity decision-making.

2. **Identify Threat Information Collected for Continuous Monitoring**
Determine what threat information is collected and analyzed as part of the organization’s continuous monitoring strategy.

3. **Locate Underutilized Threat Information**
Find threat information that is collected and stored, but not necessarily analyzed or reviewed on an ongoing basis. If an organization finds useful threat information that is being underutilized, methods of integrating this information into its cybersecurity and risk management practices should be explored.

4. **Identify Shareable Threat Information**
Determine which threat information is suitable for sharing with outside parties and could help them more effectively respond to threats.

## Role of Owners and Operators

The owners and operators of threat information sources play an important role in the inventory process and should be consulted. These personnel understand:

- What information is available and how it is natively stored
- The data export formats that are supported
- The query languages, protocols, and services available for data retrieval

Some sources may store and publish structured, machine-readable data, while others may provide unstructured data with no fixed format (e.g., free text or images). Structured data that is expressed using open, machine-readable, standard formats can generally be more readily accessed, searched, and analyzed by a wider range of tools. Thus, the format of the information plays a significant role in determining the ease and efficiency of information use, analysis, and exchange.

## Addressing Information Gaps

As part of the inventory process, organizations should take note of information gaps that may prevent realization of the organization’s goals and objectives. By identifying these gaps, an organization is better able to prioritize investments into new capabilities and identify opportunities to fill gaps by acquiring threat information from other, possibly external, sources or through the deployment of additional tools or sensors.

## Common Sources of Cybersecurity-Related Information

Table 3-1 describes common sources of cybersecurity-related information and provides examples of data elements from these sources that may be of interest to security operations personnel.

Organizations should update the inventory when new sensors, repositories, or capabilities are deployed or when significant changes to a device’s configuration, ownership, or other relevant factors occur.# Information Sharing Guidelines

## 3.3 Define the Scope of Information Sharing Activities

Organizations should specify the scope of their information sharing activities by identifying the types of information available to share, the circumstances under which sharing this information is permitted, and those with whom the information can and should be shared. Organizations should review their information sharing goals and objectives while scoping information sharing activities to ensure that priorities are addressed.

When defining these activities, organizations should ensure that the information sources and capabilities needed to support each activity are available. Organizations should also consider pursuing sharing activities that will address known information gaps. For example, an organization might not have an internal malware analysis capability, but it may gain access to malware indicators by participating in a sharing community.

The breadth of information sharing activities will vary based on an organization’s resources and abilities. By choosing a relatively narrow scope, an organization with limited resources can focus on a smaller set of activities that provides the greatest value to the organization and its sharing partners. An organization may be able to expand the scope as additional capabilities and resources become available. Such an incremental approach may help to ensure that information sharing activities support an organization’s information sharing goals and objectives, while at the same time fit within available resources.

Organizations with greater resources and advanced capabilities may choose a larger initial scope that allows for a broader set of activities in support of their goals and objectives. The degree of automation available to support the sharing and receipt of threat information is a factor to consider when establishing the scope of sharing activities. Less automated approaches or manual approaches, which require direct human intervention, may increase human resource costs and limit the breadth and volume of information that can be processed. The use of automated exchange mechanisms can help reduce human resource costs and allow an organization to exchange threat information on a larger scale. Automated threat information sharing concepts are further discussed in section 4.

## 3.4 Establish Information Sharing Rules

Before sharing threat information, organizations should:

- List the types of threat information that may be shared.
- Describe the conditions and circumstances when sharing is permitted.
- Identify approved recipients of threat information.
- Describe any requirements for redacting or sanitizing information to be shared.
- Specify if source attribution is permitted.
- Apply information handling designations that describe recipient obligations for protecting information.

Sharing rules help control the publication and distribution of threat information, and consequently help to prevent the dissemination of information that, if improperly disclosed, may have adverse consequences for the organization or its customers or business partners. Information sharing rules should take into consideration the trustworthiness of the recipient, the sensitivity of the information, and the potential impact of its disclosure.# Information Sharing Guidelines

## Overview
Organizations must establish rules for sharing information, particularly regarding sensitive data. These rules can dictate how different levels of sensitivity are handled, from highly sensitive information shared only internally to non-sensitive information that can be freely exchanged in public forums.

## Internal Threat Information Sharing
Large organizations aiming to share internal threat information across business units should create specific rules for this exchange. Business units that collect or process threat information should be involved in determining what information will be shared and the methods of sharing.

### Considerations for Multinational Corporations
Multinational corporations must navigate varying privacy laws across nations and address the handling of classified information, which often cannot be shared with foreign nationals.

## Establishing Information Sharing Rules
When creating and reviewing information sharing rules, organizations should seek input from:

- Legal and privacy officials
- Information owners
- Management teams
- Other key stakeholders

This collaboration ensures that sharing rules align with the organization’s documented policies and procedures. Sharing rules can be formalized through various agreements, such as:

- Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)
- Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)
- Framework Agreements

Organizations are encouraged to proactively establish threat information sharing agreements as part of their cybersecurity operations, rather than waiting until an active cyber incident occurs.

## Reevaluation of Information Sharing Rules
Organizations should regularly reevaluate their information sharing rules. Triggers for reevaluation may include:

- Changes to regulatory or legal requirements
- Updates to organizational policy
- Introduction of new information sources
- Changes in risk tolerance
- Changes in information ownership
- Changes in the operating/threat environment
- Organizational mergers and acquisitions

## Information Sensitivity and Privacy
Many organizations manage information that requires protection due to regulations, laws, or contractual obligations. This includes:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
- Sensitive information protected under various laws, such as:
- Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA)
- Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)

Organizations should identify and properly protect such sensitive information. It is advisable to consult the legal team, privacy officers, auditors, and experts familiar with regulatory frameworks when developing procedures for identifying and protecting sensitive information.# Threat Information Sharing and Privacy Considerations

## Introduction
From a privacy perspective, one of the key challenges with threat information sharing is the potential for disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Education and awareness activities are critical to ensure that individuals responsible for handling threat information understand how to recognize and safeguard PII.

## Internal Sharing of Information
Internal sharing of information may result in the disclosure of PII to people who, by virtue of their job functions, would not typically have routine access to such information. For example, a forensic analyst or incident responder may encounter PII while:

- Searching a hard drive for malware indicators
- Reviewing emails related to suspected phishing attacks
- Inspecting packet captures

The analyst has a legitimate need to review this information to investigate an exploit, develop detection strategies, or develop defensive measures. If the result of such an analysis is shared with others, steps should be taken to protect the confidentiality of PII.

## Information Sharing Policies and Procedures
An organization should have information sharing policies and procedures in place that provide guidance for the handling of PII. These policies and procedures should include:

- Steps for identifying incident data types that are likely to contain PII
- Proper safeguards for managing the privacy risks associated with sharing such data

A common practice is to focus on the exchange of indicators to the maximum extent possible. Some indicators, such as file hashes, network port numbers, registry key values, and other data elements, are largely free of PII.

### Redaction of PII
Where PII is identified, organizations should redact fields containing PII that are not relevant to investigating or addressing threats before sharing. The type and degree of protection applied should be based on:

- The intended use of the information
- The sensitivity of the information
- The intended recipient

## Automated Methods for PII Protection
Where practical, organizations are encouraged to use automated methods rather than human-oriented methods to identify and protect PII. Manual identification, extraction, and obfuscation of PII can be a slow, error-prone, and resource-intensive process.

### Examples of Automated Methods
Automated methods may include:

- Field-level data validation using permitted values lists
- Searching for PII using pattern matching techniques such as regular expressions
- Performing operations that de-identify, mask, and anonymize data containing PII

The degree of automation that can be achieved will vary based on factors such as the structure, complexity, and sensitivity of the information.

## Safeguards for Proprietary Information
Organizations should also implement safeguards to protect intellectual property, trade secrets, and other proprietary information from unauthorized disclosure. The disclosure of such information could result in:

- Financial loss
- Violation of NDAs or other sharing agreements
- Legal action
- Damage to an organization’s reputation

### Plan for Unauthorized Disclosure
Organizations should have a plan in place to address the unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). The plan should cover:

- Containment, control, and recovery procedures
- Breach notification requirements
- Post-incident activities such as capturing lessons learned

## Conclusion
Table 3-2 introduces selected types of threat information, provides examples of sensitive data that may be present in these types of threat information, and offers general recommendations.# Handling Threat Information

## 3.4.2 Sharing Designations

A variety of methods exist to designate handling requirements for shared threat information. These designations identify unclassified information that may not be suitable for public release and that may require special handling. A designation applied to threat information can communicate specific handling requirements and identify data elements that are considered sensitive and should be redacted prior to sharing. Organizations are encouraged to provide clear handling guidance for any shared threat information. Likewise, recipients of threat information should observe the handling, attribution, dissemination, and storage requirements expressed in the source organization’s handling guidance.

### Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)

The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP), depicted in Table 3-3, provides a framework for expressing sharing designations. The TLP specifies a color-coded set of restrictions that indicate which restrictions apply to a particular record. In the TLP, red specifies the most restrictive rule, with information sharable only in a particular exchange or meeting, not even within a participant’s own organization. The amber, green, and white color codes specify successively relaxed restrictions.

### Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) Schema

The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) has also proposed a schema for expressing sharing designations. The APWG schema describes an extensible, hierarchical tagging system that can be used to express distribution restrictions on shared information. The tags can be used to indicate with whom the information may or may not be shared (e.g., recipient only, with affected parties only, no restrictions) and to express other caveats (e.g., that no attribution is permitted).

### Tear Line Reporting

For some threat information, collection methods may be considered confidential or proprietary, but the actual indicators observed may be shareable. In such cases, an organization may want to use tear line reporting, an approach where reports are organized such that information of differing sensitivity is not intermingled (e.g., the indicator information is presented in a separate part of the document than the collection methods). Organizing a report in this manner allows an organization to readily produce a report containing only information that designated recipients are authorized to receive.

An organization should carefully choose, or formulate, an approach for expressing sharing designations. Regardless of how an organization expresses sharing designations, the procedures for applying designations to threat information should be documented and approved, and the personnel responsible for assigning such designations properly trained.

## 3.4.3 Cyber Threat Information Sharing and Tracking Procedures

Over time, an organization’s cybersecurity activities can result in the accumulation of large quantities of threat information from various sources, both internal and external. Though challenging, tracking of data sources is important both for protecting information owners and for ensuring that consuming organizations can meet their legal or regulatory commitments for data protection. Organizations should...# Information Sharing and Tracking Procedures

## Importance of Provenance
Organizations must preserve the provenance of data by tracking who provided the information and how it was collected, transformed, or processed. This information is crucial for drawing conclusions from shared data.

## Procedures for Sharing Threat Information
An organization should formulate procedures that allow for the prompt sharing of threat information while satisfying obligations to protect potentially sensitive data. The procedures should balance the risks of ineffective sharing against the risks of flawed protection.

### Key Procedures
An organization’s information sharing and tracking procedures should:
- Identify threat information that can be readily shared with trusted parties.
- Establish processes for reviewing, sanitizing, and protecting threat information likely to contain sensitive information.
- Develop a plan for addressing leakage of sensitive data.
- Automate the processing and exchange of threat information where possible.
- Describe how information handling designations are applied, monitored, and enforced.
- Accommodate non-attributed information exchange when needed.
- Track internal and external sources of threat information.

### Roles and Responsibilities
The procedures should describe the roles, responsibilities, and authorities (both scope and duration) of all stakeholders. They should allow for the effective transfer of authority and flow of shared information to key decision-makers and enable collaboration with approved external communities when necessary.

## Joining a Sharing Community
When evaluating potential sharing partners, an organization should seek sources that complement its existing threat information resources or offer actionable information that addresses known gaps in situational awareness.

### Types of Sharing Communities
Since sharing communities may focus on specific types of threat information, an organization may need to participate in multiple information sharing forums to meet its objectives. Threat information can be acquired from:
- Public and private sharing communities
- Government repositories
- Internal sources
- Commercial threat information feeds
- Open sources

### Characteristics of Sharing Communities
Sharing communities often organize around shared characteristics or interests, which may include:
- Geographic region
- Political boundary
- Industrial sector
- Business interest
- Threat space (e.g., phishing attacks)

Many of these communities have multinational constituencies and global reach.

### Examples of Potential Sharing Partners
Examples of potential sharing partners include:
- Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)
- Domestic and foreign Computer Emergency Readiness Teams (CERTs) or CSIRTs
- Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs)
- DHS Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) initiative
- Threat and vulnerability repositories
- Law enforcement agencies
- Product vendors
- Managed security service providers
- Internet service providers
- Supply chain partners
- Industry sector peers
- Business partners
- Customers

Some communities are informal, open, self-organizing groups that operate through voluntary cooperation. Membership in these communities is often mutable (i.e., no formal fixed membership), sometimes anonymous, and members may maintain full autonomy with minimal oversight.# Central Coordination

These communities generally operate under basic rules of conduct rather than formal agreements. In such communities, members publish threat information to the community on a voluntary, ad hoc basis and are individually responsible for ensuring that the content provided to the community is suitable for sharing.

Organizations wishing to consume information can subscribe to or access various delivery mechanisms offered by a community such as web services, email or text alerts, and RSS feeds. Such sharing communities generally make no assertions regarding the quality and accuracy of data provided by their members, and the degree to which the information should be trusted depends on the reputation of submitters (if known).

## Formal Sharing Communities

In contrast, formal sharing communities may define specific membership rules such as:

- Membership fee structures;
- Eligibility requirements for institutions (e.g., must operate within a specific industry sector);
- Eligibility requirements for individuals (e.g., must have enterprise-wide security responsibilities);
- Nomination or sponsorship requirements (i.e., brokered trust);
- Probationary membership period requirements;
- Types of threat information the community provides/accepts;
- Standard delivery mechanisms, formats, and protocols supported by the community; and
- Required organizational cybersecurity capabilities.

Formal communities may recruit members by invitation or through sponsorship, and, as such, members are vetted. Membership rosters in formal communities are generally more stable than those of informal communities. The exchange of information in a formal community is often governed through service level agreements (SLAs), NDAs, and other agreements that describe the responsibilities of its members and participating organizations. Some communities collect an annual membership fee to cover the services and administrative costs of the community. These fees vary by community and the fee structure is sometimes tiered, providing for different levels of membership and service.

## Considerations for Information Sharing Agreements

Before entering into information sharing agreements, an organization should obtain approval from the:

- Leadership team that has oversight for information sharing activities and for controlling the resources necessary to support the organization’s information sharing goals;
- Legal team or those with the authority to enter into commitments; and
- Privacy officers and other key stakeholders that have a role in the collection, ingest, storage, analysis, publication, or protection of threat information.

When choosing a sharing community, consideration should be given to the types of information that are shared within the community, the structure and dynamics of the community, and the cost of entry and sustainment of membership.

## Evaluating Information Sharing

When evaluating how information is shared within a community, an organization should consider the following questions:

- Is the threat information shared within the community relevant and does it complement existing threat information by providing meaningful insights in the context of an organization’s threat environment?
- Is the threat information exchanged within the community actionable?
- Does the community have mechanisms in place to accept non-attributed threat information?# Information Sharing Considerations

## Key Questions for Information Sharing

- Is the threat information timely, reliable, and of known good quality?
- Are the information exchange formats used by the community compatible with the infrastructure and tools used in an organization?
- Given the frequency and volume of data sent by a community, does an organization have the capacity to ingest, analyze, and store the information?

## Community Dynamics

In addition to the information shared within a community, consideration should also be given to the dynamics of the community and its participants, including:

- What is the size and composition of the community? (e.g., number of participants, information producers, and information consumers)
- How active is the community? (e.g., number of submissions or requests per day)
- Are community members recruited and vetted? If so, how?
- What are the technical skills and proficiencies of the community members?
- What is the community’s governance model?
- What are the initial and sustained costs of membership?
- What type of sharing agreement does the community use?
- Is the sharing agreement well-aligned with an organization’s goals, objectives, and business rules?
- What are the community’s data retention and disposal policies?

When researching sharing communities, organizations are encouraged to have conversations with current or former members regarding their experiences as a participant in a community. Such conversations can provide additional insight and help an organization assess the trustworthiness of a prospective community.

## Ongoing Support for Information Sharing Activities

Organizations should develop a support plan that addresses information sharing infrastructure maintenance and user support. The plan should identify the personnel, funding, infrastructure, and processes needed to:

- Collect and analyze the information from both internal and external sources.
- Acquire and deploy protective measures.
- Acquire and deploy a monitoring and threat detection infrastructure.

Organizations should provide funding for the personnel, infrastructure, and training required for ongoing operational support for data collection, storage, analysis, and dissemination; for technology refreshment; and for membership or service fees required for community participation. Although participation in information sharing activities will require ongoing funding, effective use of threat information may avoid the potentially much larger costs of successful attacks.

# Participating in Sharing Relationships

An organization’s participation in an information sharing community will typically include some or all of the following activities:

- Engage in ongoing communication (section 4.1)
- Consume and respond to security alerts (section 4.2)
- Consume and use indicators (section 4.3)
- Organize and store indicators (section 4.4)
- Produce and publish indicators (section 4.5)

The following sections describe these activities in greater detail. Organizations just starting their threat information sharing efforts should initially choose one or two activities to focus on and should consider adding activities as their information sharing capability matures.# Threat Information Sharing

## Introduction
Threat information sharing augments—not replaces—an organization’s fundamental cybersecurity capabilities, regardless of the maturity of their information sharing practices.

## 4.1 Engage in Ongoing Communication
Information sharing communities use a variety of communication methods to share threat information with their members. Most organizations can receive threat information via:

- Email lists
- Text alerts
- Web portals

These methods typically do not require infrastructure investments specific to information sharing, although the content received may need to be manually processed (e.g., "cut and paste" into tools).

### Standard Data Formats
Organizations with security tools that support standard data formats can utilize standards-based data feeds that enable semi-automated ingest, processing, and use of threat information. Other information sharing methods, such as conferences and workshops, require dedicated staff and travel. Organizations that actively produce and share threat information are likely to incur higher communication costs.

### Communication Types
Communications may be:

- **Event-driven**: In response to the actions or behavior of an actor.
- **Periodic**: Such as bi-weekly reviews, teleconferences, and annual conferences.

The level of detail, volume, and frequency of messages delivered in human-readable formats varies widely across information sharing communities. Some communities aim to deliver the most current threat information with minimal latency, while others may prefer summary data for trending and analysis, with no need for near real-time delivery of detailed information.

### Subscription Options
To reduce the number of messages generated, sharing communities sometimes provide the option of subscribing to digests (i.e., compilations of messages over time intervals) rather than receiving individual messages.

## Integration and Best Practices
An organization that has recently joined an information sharing community may require time to:

- Integrate new threat information sources into existing cybersecurity practices.
- Configure security tools.
- Train decision-makers on how to interpret and act upon the threat information.

During this ramp-up period, an organization should:

- Consult any best practices guidance offered by the community.
- Observe and learn from the interactions of more experienced members.
- Query community support resources (e.g., community knowledgebase, FAQs, blogs).

Community-sponsored training events also provide opportunities for less mature organizations and inexperienced employees to gain practical insights from skilled practitioners.

## Recruitment and Retention
Organizations should establish recruitment and retention processes that reduce personnel turnover and foster the formation of trusted professional relationships between sharing communities and organizations. Retention of skilled staff mitigates the loss of institutional knowledge and preserves investments in training.

## Ongoing Participation
Ongoing participation in a sharing community is essential for fostering trust, establishing stronger ties to other members, and continuously improving practices. Organizations that actively participate in community-sponsored conference calls and face-to-face meetings are better able to establish trust with other members.# Security Alerts and Response

## 4.2 Consume and Respond to Security Alerts

An information sharing community may publish security alerts notifying community members of emerging vulnerabilities, exploits, and other security issues. Fields that commonly appear in security alerts such as US-CERT alerts, NVD vulnerability advisories, and vendor security bulletins include:

- **Brief overview/executive summary and detailed description**, which would include indicators;
- **Platforms affected** (e.g., operating system, application, hardware);
- **Estimated impact** (e.g., system crash, data exfiltration, application hijacking);
- **Severity rating** (e.g., Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS));
- **Mitigation options**, including permanent fixes and/or temporary workarounds;
- **References for more information**; and
- **Alert metadata** (e.g., alert creation and modification dates, acknowledgments).

Upon receipt of a security alert, an organization should determine if the alert came from a trusted, reliable source. When alerts originate from unknown or untrusted sources, organizations may need to apply greater scrutiny and/or seek independent confirmation before taking action. If an alert is deemed credible and it applies to systems, applications, or hardware that the organization owns or operates, the organization should determine a suitable course of action.

When determining a proper response, an organization should characterize the overall impact of an alert by assessing factors such as the severity of the alert, the number of affected systems within the organization, the effects an attack might have on the organization’s mission-critical functions, and any operational impacts related to the deployment of mitigating security controls. This assessment should inform the prioritization and approach for response actions.

Response actions include activities such as:

- Identifying and extracting indicators from an alert;
- Using indicators to develop and deploy detection signatures;
- Making configuration changes;
- Applying patches;
- Notifying personnel of threats; and
- Implementing or enhancing security controls.

Extracting indicators is largely a manual process today, but there are clear incentives for automating indicator handling workflows. Manual processing of indicators can be time-consuming, tedious, error-prone, and slow; automation of the activities allows analysts to focus on the interpretation of information, rather than routine data manipulations.

## 4.3 Consume and Use Indicators

The consumption and use of indicators from external feeds is often a multi-step process that includes some, if not all, of the following activities:

- **Validation**: verifying the integrity of indicator content and provenance through digital signatures, cryptographic hashes, or other means.
- **Decryption**: transforming encrypted indicator files or data streams back to their original format.
- **Decompression**: unpacking compressed indicator files, archive files (e.g., zip, tar), or data streams.
- **Content extraction**: parsing indicator files and extracting indicators of interest to an organization.
- **Prioritization**: processing indicators based on relative importance, the perceived value of a data source, the overall confidence in the data, and any operational requirements that specify that data sources.# Data Processing and Indicator Management

## Overview
Data processing involves transforming data into actionable information, which can be influenced by various factors such as the order of processing and the effort required.

## Categorization
- **Indicator Metadata Review**: This involves determining the security designation and handling requirements of indicators. Sensitive information may necessitate:
- Encrypted storage
- Stringent access control
- Limitations on distribution

These activities are typically performed in a specific order, although it may vary based on operational or security requirements. Organizations are encouraged to utilize automated techniques to expedite the availability of indicators and reduce manual effort.

In cases of informal sharing (e.g., via email), prioritization and categorization remain crucial and should be conducted by the recipient.

## Characteristics of Ideal Indicators
Indicators should ideally possess the following characteristics:

### Timeliness
- Indicators should be delivered with minimal latency to allow recipients adequate time to prepare suitable responses. The criticality of timing depends on:
- Threat characteristics (severity, speed, ease of propagation)
- Targeted infrastructure
- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used
- Capabilities of the actor(s)

### Relevance
- Indicators must be applicable to the recipient's operating environment and address likely threats. Processing irrelevant indicators can create unnecessary work for analysts and hinder prioritization and categorization.

### Accuracy
- Indicators should be correct, complete, and unambiguous. Inaccurate or incomplete information can lead to:
- Uncertainty
- Ineffective responses
- False sense of security

Recipients should be informed of any uncertainties or caveats regarding the accuracy of an indicator.

### Specificity
- Indicators should provide clear descriptions of observable events that can help recipients detect threats while minimizing false positives and negatives.

### Actionability
- Indicators must provide sufficient information and context to enable recipients to formulate an appropriate response.

## Practical Considerations
In practice, an indicator may exhibit some, but not all, of these characteristics. For instance, a single ambiguous indicator may gain clarity when aggregated and analyzed with threat information from other sources, enhancing its value.

Threat information from multiple sources may vary in precision and accuracy, making it essential for users to evaluate the information and assign tags that describe the quality or confidence level. These tags are particularly important when resolving discrepancies between threat information sources.

As organizations enrich indicators, any new insights should be shared to benefit the entire community. Organizations may utilize both externally and internally generated indicators to:
- Add or modify rules or signatures used by firewalls
- Enhance intrusion detection systems
- Improve data loss prevention measures# Cyber Threat Information Management

## Using Indicators for Threat Detection and Response

Organizations can utilize indicators in various ways to enhance their security posture:

- **Block or Alert on Activity**: Implement systems and security controls to block or alert on activities that match known indicators (e.g., connections involving IP addresses on a blacklist).
- **Configure Security Solutions**: Set up security information and event management (SIEM) solutions or other log management systems to assist in analyzing security log data.
- **Scan Security Logs**: Use indicators as search keys to scan security logs, systems, or other information sources to identify potentially compromised systems.
- **Incident Investigation**: Find matching records during an incident investigation to gather more information about a threat, which can expedite incident response and recovery actions.
- **Support Security Analysts**: Provide additional information to security operations center (SOC) analysts.
- **Educate Staff**: Train staff on the characteristics of threats.
- **Identify Threat Trends**: Recognize threat trends that may indicate a need for changes in security controls.

### Trust in Sources

An organization's willingness to use indicators from external sources is heavily influenced by the level of trust in those sources. Indicators from trusted sources may be used immediately for threat detection and response, while those from untrusted sources may require:

- Independent validation
- Additional research
- Testing before implementation

### Risk-Based Approach

Organizations should adopt a risk-based approach when evaluating the characteristics of received indicators. Factors to consider include:

- **Service Disruptions**: Some organizations prioritize security and may accept blocking benign activity, while others may prioritize service availability and only monitor for potential malicious activity.

Ultimately, each organization must determine the most effective use of indicators based on its unique context.

## Organizing and Storing Cyber Threat Information

Organizations often collect indicators from various sources, including:

- Open source repositories
- Commercial threat feeds
- External partners

### Knowledgebase Organization

Depending on the usage of indicators, there may be a need to organize them in a knowledgebase. Options for organization include:

- **Free-form Methods**: Tools like wikis can be flexible and suitable for developing working notes and indicator metadata.
- **Structured Databases**: Useful for storing, organizing, tracking, querying, and analyzing collections of indicators.

### Common Information Recorded

When maintaining a knowledgebase, organizations typically record the following information, when known:

- Source of an indicator
- Rules governing the use or sharing of an indicator
- Date or time an indicator was collected
- Validity period of an indicator
- Specific organizations or sectors targeted by attacks associated with an indicator
- Associated records such as Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), and Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)
- Groups or actors associated with an indicator
- Aliases of any associated actors# Threat Indicator Management

## Commonly Used TTPs
- TTPs commonly used by an actor
- Motives or intent of an associated actor
- Individuals or types of individuals targeted in associated attacks
- Systems targeted in attacks

## Security Practices for Indicator Knowledgebase
An indicator knowledgebase is an attractive target of attack; therefore, effective security practices should be followed, including:
- Implementing access controls
- Performing regular backups
- Maintaining operating system and application software by installing current patches
- Verifying secure configurations
- Following software development best practices for the production of any in-house software used for the knowledgebase

## Policies and Procedures for Indicator Disposition
Organizations should establish policies and procedures that address the disposition of indicators (and threat information in general). These policies should define:
- Data retention requirements for short (online) and long (offline) term availability of indicator information
- Information handling and retention requirements that may change once threat information is entered into evidence

### Evidence Collection and Preservation
Evidence acquired during any incident investigations should be collected and preserved using best practices for data preservation, following chain of custody requirements and other laws pertaining to the submission of evidence. A more detailed treatment of forensic techniques related to chain of custody and preserving information integrity is available in:
- NIST Special Publication 800-86
- Section 3.3.2 of NIST Special Publication 800-61

### Retention Policies for Non-Evidential Indicators
For indicators that are not needed as evidence, organizations should determine proper retention policies. Although retaining threat information has costs, detailed information may provide historical value and help new sharing community members and partners understand the persistence and evolution of different actors and attack types. Other considerations, such as financial, legal, contractual, or regulatory issues, may limit data retention to a fixed period of months or years. Once a retention schedule is identified, organizations should either archive or destroy the indicators per applicable policies.

## Producing and Publishing Indicators
Many organizations only consume indicators. However, some organizations, often those with more advanced security capabilities, choose to produce and publish their own indicators. An organization may benefit substantially by producing threat information, including:
- Gaining greater expertise
- Helping other organizations more effectively respond to threats in their environments
- Fostering trust with other community members

These effects are important for building and sustaining the flow of threat information that ultimately benefits a producing organization. A producer of shared threat information must decide:
- What, if any, metadata should accompany shared information
- What data formats should be used
- How sensitive data should be handled
- How information sharing rules should be updated over time

### Indicator Enrichment
Indicators that are produced and published should include metadata that provides context for each indicator, describes how the indicator is to be used and interpreted, and how the information should be handled.# Indicator Sharing and Management

## Overview
The indicator production process should provide a mechanism for publishing indicators, updating indicators and associated metadata, and retracting submissions that are incorrect or perhaps inadvertently shared.

## Metadata Considerations
- Metadata may include sensitivity designations and provenance information (e.g., what tool was used to acquire the data, how the data was processed, who collected the data).
- As indicators are created, aggregated, or enriched, their sensitivity and classification should be reevaluated.
- An aggregation, association, or enrichment process may enable re-identification (e.g., using data mining techniques) or elevate the sensitivity of the information, thus necessitating additional data handling restrictions.

## Feedback Mechanism
Organizations that share indicators should provide a feedback mechanism that allows sharing partners to:
- Submit error reports
- Suggest improvements
- Request additional information about the indicators

Such feedback plays an important role in the enrichment, maturation, and quality of the indicators shared within a community.

## Handling Sensitive Information
Some information shared within a community may be marked as "currently under investigation" and may require that members avoid sharing beyond the collective. Such markings may also prohibit members from performing active information collection (e.g., retrieving malware samples from a suspect website, or performing DNS lookups on suspect hostnames) that might tip off a potential actor or otherwise compromise investigative activities.

At some point, such information will probably have its distribution and investigation restrictions downgraded, so a mechanism to change the marking or to add a revised marking (e.g., "downgraded to GREEN as of 12/20/2015") is useful.

## Standard Data Formats

### Importance of Standardization
The use of standard data formats for the exchange of indicators enhances interoperability and allows information to be exchanged with greater speed.

### Format Suitability
- Unstructured formats (e.g., text documents, email) are suitable for high-level threat reports and ad hoc exchanges of indicator information intended to be read by security personnel rather than machines.
- For time-critical exchanges of indicators, such as automatically configuring a firewall to block specified communications, the use of standard data formats is encouraged because such formats reduce the need for human assistance.

### Participation in Standards Development
Organizations are encouraged to participate in threat information sharing standards development activities by:
- Sharing use cases
- Identifying desired features
- Providing feedback to standards development organizations

Organizations should seek out data formats and exchange protocols that can effectively support their key threat information sharing use cases, demonstrate a high degree of maturity, broad adoption, and enable interoperability between a wide range of products and/or organizations.

## Protection of Sensitive Data
The indicators that an organization publishes may be sensitive, so proper safeguards should be used to protect this information.# Preventing Unauthorized Disclosure or Modification

Indicator data can be protected using a variety of methods, including:

- Encrypted network communications
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Storage in a hardened repository

## Repository Management

If a repository is used, an organization should have a written Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the repository that specifies:

- Expected availability
- Security posture requirements
- Acceptable use policies

## Sharing Sensitive Information

When producing indicators that may contain sensitive information, proper sharing rules (see section 3.4) should be followed. Information should be shared only with community members that are:

- Trusted to follow sharing rules
- Have agreed to do so
