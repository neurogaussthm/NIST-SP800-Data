# Abstract
Many people telework, and they use a variety of devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, and tablets, to read and send email, access websites, review and edit documents, and perform many other tasks. Each telework device is controlled by the organization, a third party (such as the organization’s contractors, business partners, and vendors), or the teleworker; the latter is known as bring your own device (BYOD). This publication provides recommendations for securing BYOD devices used for telework and remote access, as well as those directly attached to the enterprise’s own networks.

# Executive Summary
Many people telework (also known as telecommuting), which is the ability for an organization’s employees, contractors, business partners, vendors, and/or other users to perform work from locations other than the organization’s facilities. Teleworkers use various devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, and tablets, to read and send email, access websites, review and edit documents, and perform many other tasks. Most teleworkers use remote access, which is the ability of an organization’s users to access its non-public computing resources from locations other than the organization’s facilities. Organizations have many options for providing remote access, including virtual private networks, remote system control, and individual application access (e.g., webmail).

Telework devices can be divided into two categories: personal computers (desktops, laptops) and mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets). Each telework device is controlled by the organization, the teleworker, or a third party the teleworker is affiliated with (a contractor, business partner, or vendor for the organization). Telework devices controlled by the user are also known as bring your own device (BYOD). This publication provides recommendations for securing BYOD devices used for telework and remote access, as well as those directly attached to the enterprise’s own networks.

Many organizations limit the types of BYOD devices that can be used and which resources they can use, such as permitting BYOD laptops to access a limited set of resources and permitting all other BYOD devices to access webmail only. This allows organizations to limit the risk they incur from BYOD devices. When a telework device uses remote access, it is essentially a logical extension of the organization’s own network. Therefore, if the telework device is not secured properly, it poses additional risk to not only the information that the teleworker accesses but also the organization’s other systems and networks. For example, a telework device infected with a worm could spread the worm through remote access to the organization’s internal computers. Therefore, telework devices should be secured properly and have their security maintained regularly.

Before implementing any of the recommendations or suggestions in this guide, users should back up all data and verify the validity of the backups. Readers with little or no experience configuring...# Telework Security Recommendations

## Introduction
Personal computers, mobile devices, or home networks should seek assistance in applying the recommendations. Every telework device’s existing configuration and environment is unique, so changing its configuration could have unforeseen consequences, including loss of data and loss of device or application functionality.

## General Recommendations
Implementing the following recommendations should help teleworkers improve the security of their telework devices. Some of the recommendations may be challenging for many users to implement, so users who are unsure of how to implement these recommendations should seek expert assistance.

### Understanding Policies and Requirements
Before teleworking, users should understand not only their organization’s policies and requirements but also appropriate ways of protecting the organization’s information that they may access.

### Protecting Sensitive Information
Sensitive information that is stored on or sent to or from telework devices needs to be protected so that malicious parties can neither access nor alter information. An unauthorized release of sensitive information could damage the public’s trust in an organization, jeopardize the mission of an organization, or harm individuals if their personal information has been released.

### Methods of Protection
Understanding how to protect such information accessed during teleworking can be confusing because there are many ways in which information can be protected. Examples include:
- Protecting the physical security of telework devices
- Encrypting files stored on devices
- Ensuring that information stored on devices is backed up

## Securing Home Networks
Teleworkers should ensure that all the devices on their wired and wireless home networks are properly secured, as well as the home networks themselves.

### Importance of Network Security
An important part of telework and remote access security is applying security measures to the personal computers (PCs) and mobile devices using the same wired and wireless home networks to which the telework device normally connects. If any of these other devices become infected with malware or are otherwise compromised, they could attack the telework device or eavesdrop on its communications.

### Caution with Network Access
Teleworkers should also be cautious about allowing others to place devices on the teleworkers’ home networks, in case one of these devices is compromised.

### Security Measures for Home Networks
Teleworkers should apply security measures to the home networks to which their telework devices normally connect. Examples of security measures include:
- Using a broadband router or firewall appliance to prevent computers outside the home network from initiating communications with telework devices on the home network.
- Ensuring that sensitive information transmitted over a wireless home network is adequately protected through strong encryption.

## Securing BYOD Devices
Teleworkers who use a BYOD desktop or laptop (PC) for telework should secure its operating system and primary applications.

### Actions for Securing a BYOD PC
Securing a BYOD PC includes the following actions:
- Using a combination of security software, such as antivirus software, personal firewalls, spam and web content filtering, and popup blocking, to stop most attacks, particularly malware.# Security Recommendations for Teleworkers

## PC Security Measures
- **User Account Management**
- Restrict who can use the PC by having a separate standard user account for each person.
- Assign a password to each user account.
- Use standard user accounts for daily use.
- Protect user sessions from unauthorized physical access.

- **Regular Updates**
- Ensure that updates are regularly applied to the operating system and primary applications, such as web browsers, email clients, instant messaging clients, and security software.

- **Networking Configuration**
- Disable unneeded networking features on the PC.
- Configure wireless networking securely.

- **Application Security**
- Configure primary applications to filter content and stop other activity that is likely to be malicious.
- Install and use only known and trusted software.

- **Remote Access Configuration**
- Configure remote access software based on the organization’s requirements and recommendations.

- **Ongoing Security Maintenance**
- Maintain the PC’s security on an ongoing basis, such as changing passwords regularly and checking the status of security software periodically.

## BYOD Mobile Device Security
Teleworkers who use a BYOD mobile device for telework should secure it based on the security recommendations from the device’s manufacturer.

### General Recommendations
- **Access Control**
- Limit access to the device by setting a unique personal identification number (PIN) or password not used elsewhere.
- Automatically lock the device after an idle period.

- **Networking Features**
- Disable networking capabilities, such as Bluetooth and Near Field Communication (NFC), except when needed.

- **Security Updates**
- Ensure that security updates, if available, are acquired and installed at least weekly, preferably daily.

- **Application Configuration**
- Configure applications to support security (e.g., blocking activity that is likely to be malicious).

- **App Sources**
- Download and run apps only from authorized app stores.

- **Device Integrity**
- Do not jailbreak or root the device.
- Do not connect the device to an unknown charging station.

- **Data Access Environment**
- Use an isolated, protected, and encrypted environment that is supported and managed by the organization to access the organization’s data and services.

## Device Control for Teleworkers
Teleworkers should avoid using any client device for telework that is not controlled by the organization, the teleworker, or the teleworker’s affiliated organization (contractor, business partner, vendor, etc.).

### Risks of Unknown Devices
Teleworkers often want to perform remote access from unknown devices, such as checking email from a kiosk computer at a hotel or from a friend’s mobile phone. However, teleworkers typically do not know if such devices have been secured properly or if they have been compromised.

Consequently, a teleworker could use a device infected with malware that steals their information (e.g., passwords, email messages, and other sensitive data). Many organizations either prohibit unknown devices from being used for telework.# Remote Access and Telework Security Guide

## 2. Overview of Telework Technologies

Many people telework (also known as telecommuting), which is the ability for an organization’s employees, contractors, business partners, vendors, and/or other users to perform work from locations other than the organization’s facilities. Teleworkers use various devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, smartphones, and tablets, to read and send email, access websites, review and edit documents, and perform many other tasks. Most teleworkers use remote access, which is the ability for an organization’s users to access its non-public computing resources from locations other than the organization’s facilities.

This section of the publication provides an overview of telework technologies. It discusses commonly used remote access methods and talks about the need to secure telework devices, such as laptops and smartphones.

### 2.1 Remote Access Methods

Organizations have many options for providing remote access to their computing resources. The options most commonly used for teleworkers are as follows:

- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: A VPN is a secure “tunnel” that connects the teleworker’s device to the organization’s network. Once the tunnel has been established, the teleworker can access many of the organization’s computing resources through the tunnel. The types of VPNs most commonly used for teleworking are as follows:
- **Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) VPN**: An IPsec VPN can give teleworkers access to many different types of resources, such as applications, file servers, and printers. Using an IPsec VPN requires IPsec client software to be installed and configured on each telework device. Various applications, such as a word processor for viewing and editing documents, also may need to be installed. Because of the software installation and configuration needs, IPsec VPNs are most often accessed from computers issued and controlled by the organization. Some organizations permit teleworkers to install IPsec VPN clients on their own PCs and mobile devices. The client software is often preconfigured by the organization and provided to the teleworkers; otherwise, teleworkers can configure IPsec VPN clients built into their devices or acquire, install, and configure third-party clients.
- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN**: Some SSL VPNs primarily provide access to web applications through standard web browsers. Other SSL VPNs are very similar to IPsec VPNs and can provide access to many types of applications; these types of VPNs typically require users to install additional software.

- **Remote System Control**: Remote system control allows a teleworker to remotely use a PC at the organization from a telework device. The remote PC has the software installed that the teleworker needs to run, such as office productivity software (e.g., word processors, spreadsheet programs).# Telework Access Methods

## Remote System Control

The remote system control method most commonly used for telework is terminal server access, which gives each teleworker access to a separate standard virtual desktop. Terminal server access requires the teleworker to either install a special client application on the telework device or use a web interface, often with a browser plug-in or other additional software that the organization provides.

### Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)

A similar method is known as virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), which delivers virtual images of operating systems to users.

### Virtual Mobile Infrastructure (VMI)

Yet another method that is essentially VDI for smartphones and tablets is known as virtual mobile infrastructure (VMI).

## Individual Application Access

A teleworker can access an individual application remotely, usually a web application such as email access. This type of access typically requires only a web browser on the telework device, so in most cases, there is no need to reconfigure the device or install software on it before accessing the applications.

## Internet Access Methods

There are many ways in which teleworkers gain access to the Internet, including:

- Broadband networks (e.g., cable modem, wireless broadband)
- Cellular networks
- Wireless hotspots
- Other organizations’ networks

For this publication, the access method used is typically irrelevant; any special considerations related to a particular method are highlighted.

## Authentication Requirements

Most of the computing resources used through remote access are available only to an organization’s users. Before accessing such resources, users need to demonstrate their identities, such as with usernames and passwords or with credentials from a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) smart card or derived PIV credentials.

Many remote access solutions require teleworkers to authenticate multiple times; for example, a teleworker might need to authenticate to use a VPN and then authenticate to individual applications accessed through the VPN.

### Hardware Tokens

Many organizations have separate authentication systems for remote access, and it is common for teleworkers to be issued a hardware token and to have to enter a code from the token into the computer to be authenticated.

### Reauthentication

Many organizations also require teleworkers to reauthenticate periodically during long remote access sessions, such as after each eight hours of a session or after 30 minutes of idle time. These authentication options help organizations confirm that the person using remote access is authorized to do so.

## Communication Protection

Most remote access technologies and many individual applications are able to encrypt their communications automatically. This ability prevents attackers on the Internet and other networks from eavesdropping on the communications or tampering with them.

It is outside the scope of this publication to provide a detailed explanation of communications protection. Teleworkers should check with their organizations as to what protection is applied to their communications, so that they do not inadvertently transfer sensitive information over networks without adequate protection.

# Telework Devices

Telework devices can be divided into two general categories:

- **Personal Computers (PC)**: This includes desktop and laptop computers. PCs run desktop/laptop applications.# Telework Device Security Recommendations

## Overview of Device Types

### Personal Computers (PCs)
Operating systems such as Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux are commonly used on PCs. PCs can be utilized for any of the remote access methods described in Section 2.1.

### Mobile Devices
Mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, are small mobile computers. They are primarily used for remote access methods that utilize web browsers, particularly SSL VPNs and individual web application access.

The distinction between PCs and mobile devices is diminishing as mobile devices increasingly offer functionalities that were once exclusive to PCs. However, the security controls available for PCs and mobile devices remain significantly different. Therefore, this publication provides separate recommendations for each category where applicable.

## Categories of Telework Devices

### Organization-Controlled Devices
Telework devices in this category are typically acquired, configured, and managed by the organization. These devices can be used for any of the organization’s remote access methods.

### Third-Party-Controlled Devices
These telework devices are managed by a third party, often one that employs the teleworker on behalf of the organization (e.g., contractors, business partners, or vendors). The third party is responsible for securing these devices and maintaining their security. They can usually be used for many or all of the organization’s remote access methods.

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
Devices that are not controlled by the organization and are managed by the teleworkers themselves fall under the BYOD category. These devices can typically be used for many or all of the organization’s remote access methods.

### Unknown Devices
Devices labeled as “unknown” lack assurances regarding their security. These may include kiosk computers at hotels or PCs and mobile devices owned by friends and family. Remote access options for these devices are often limited, as users cannot or should not install the organization’s software (e.g., VPN software, terminal server software, and web browser plug-ins). The use of unknown devices is extremely risky due to the uncertainty of their security posture. Consequently, many organizations either prohibit the use of unknown devices for telework or allow their use only after the user restarts the PC with special removable media to boot into a secure environment.

## Device Usage Limitations
Organizations often impose restrictions on the types of devices that can be used for remote access due to security policies and technology limitations. For instance, an organization may only permit its own PCs and mobile devices for remote access. Some organizations implement tiered access levels, allowing organization PCs to access a wide range of resources, BYOD PCs to access a more limited set of resources, and BYOD mobile devices to access only one or two resources, such as webmail. This strategy helps organizations mitigate risks by granting the most controlled devices access to sensitive resources.# Telework Device Security

## 1. Introduction
The most access and the least-controlled devices should have minimal access or no access at all. Before using a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) device, each teleworker should check with their organization to confirm that the organization permits the teleworker’s BYOD devices to be used. Teleworkers should also be aware that many organizations periodically reassess their policies for telework devices and may change which types of devices are permitted. Therefore, teleworkers should ensure they review current information on remote access devices.

## 2. Telework Device Security Overview

### 2.1 Threats to Telework Devices
In today’s computing environment, there are many threats to telework devices. These threats are posed by individuals with various motivations, including causing mischief and disruption, as well as committing identity theft and other forms of fraud. Teleworkers can increase their devices’ security to provide better protection against these threats.

### 2.2 Primary Threat: Malware
The primary threat against most telework devices is malware. Malware, also known as malicious code, refers to a computer program that is covertly placed onto a computing device with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the device’s data, applications, or operating system (OS). Common types of malware threats include:
- Viruses
- Worms
- Malicious mobile code
- Trojan horses
- Rootkits
- Spyware
- Bots

Malware threats can infect devices through various means, including:
- Email
- Websites
- File downloads and file sharing
- Peer-to-peer software
- Instant messaging
- Social media

### 2.3 Other Common Threats
Another common threat against telework devices is the loss or theft of the device. Someone with physical access to a device has many options for attempting to view or copy the information stored on it.

## 3. Security Protections

### 3.1 Security Controls
Security protections, also known as security controls, are measures against threats that are intended to compensate for the device’s security weaknesses, also known as vulnerabilities. Threats attempt to take advantage of these vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities can be eliminated through security protections, such as:
- Features in applications that automatically download and install new versions correcting previous errors.

For vulnerabilities that cannot be eliminated, security protections can prevent attacks from taking advantage of them, such as:
- Antivirus software stopping an infected email from being opened by a user.
- Hard drive encryption making files unreadable by others.

### 3.2 Realistic Security Goals
Regardless of how many security protections are used, it is simply impossible to provide 100 percent protection against attacks due to the complexity of computing. A more realistic goal is to use security protections to give attackers as few opportunities as feasible to gain access to a device or to damage the device’s software or information.

## 4. Organizational Considerations
For an organization, permitting teleworkers to remotely access its computing resources gives attackers additional opportunities to breach the organization’s security. When a telework device uses remote access, it is essentially an extension of the organization’s own network. The same is true when a BYOD device is directly connected to the organization’s local network. Therefore, if the telework device is not...# Securing Telework Devices

Securing telework devices is crucial to protect both the information accessed by teleworkers and the organization’s systems and networks. An unsecured telework device can pose significant risks, such as the spread of malware through remote access to internal computers. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that telework devices are properly secured and that their security is regularly maintained.

## Security Checks for Telework Devices

Many organizations implement automatic checks on the security health of telework devices attempting to use remote access. These checks ensure compliance with organizational policies. Examples of security checks include:

- Verifying that a PC’s operating system is fully patched.
- Ensuring antivirus software is installed and up-to-date.
- Checking if a personal firewall is enabled.
- Determining if a smartphone has been rooted or jailbroken.

Some remote access solutions can also identify whether the device has been secured by the organization and the type of device (e.g., desktop/laptop, smartphone, tablet). Based on the results of these checks, organizations can decide whether to permit remote access for the device.

## Recommendations for Securing Telework Devices

The remainder of this publication provides recommendations for securing telework devices, which include:

- Securing PCs and mobile devices.
- Securing the networks that telework devices use.
- Protecting information stored on and transmitted to and from telework devices.

Additionally, guidance is provided on evaluating the security of unknown devices, helping teleworkers decide whether to use them for remote access.

# Securing Information

Sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII) (e.g., personnel records, medical records, financial records), stored on or transmitted to and from telework devices must be protected to prevent unauthorized access or alteration. An unauthorized release of sensitive information can damage public trust in an organization, jeopardize its mission, or harm individuals if their personal information is compromised.

## Understanding Organizational Policies

Before teleworking, users should familiarize themselves with their organization’s policies and requirements regarding the protection of information. This can be complex due to the various methods available for safeguarding information. Organizations may expect or require teleworkers to employ the following methods:

- **Physical Security Controls**: Telework devices and removable media should be secured physically. For instance, organizations might mandate that laptops not be left unattended in hotels, conferences, or other locations where unauthorized individuals could gain access. Physical security measures may also apply to papers and other non-computer media containing sensitive information taken outside the organization’s facilities.

- **File Encryption**: Files stored on telework devices and removable media (e.g., CDs, flash drives) should be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. Various options exist for protecting files, including encrypting individual files, folders, volumes, and hard drives. Generally, using encryption requires an authentication mechanism (e.g., password) to decrypt the files when necessary.# Telework Information Security Guidelines

## Backing Up Information
- Ensuring that information stored on telework devices is backed up. If something adverse happens to a device, such as a hardware, software, or power failure or a natural disaster, the information on the device will be lost unless it has been backed up to another device or removable media.
- Some organizations permit teleworkers to back up their local files to a centralized system (e.g., through VPN remote access), whereas other organizations recommend that their teleworkers perform local backups (e.g., burning CDs, copying files onto removable media).
- Teleworkers should perform backups, following their organizations’ guidelines, and verify that the backups are valid and complete.
- It is important that backups on removable media be secured at least as well as the device that they backed up. For example, if a computer is stored in a locked room, then the media also should be in a secured location; if a computer stores its data encrypted, then the backups of that data should also be encrypted.

## Destroying Information
- Ensuring that information is destroyed when it is no longer needed. For example, the organization’s files should be removed from a computer that is about to be retired.
- Some remote access methods perform basic information cleanup, such as clearing web browser caches that might inadvertently hold sensitive information, but more extensive cleanup typically requires using a special utility, such as a disk scrubbing program specifically designed to remove all traces of information from a device.
- Many organizations offer their teleworkers assistance in removing information from BYOD devices.
- Another example of information destruction is shredding telework papers containing sensitive information once the papers are no longer needed.

## Erasing Information from Missing Devices
- Erasing information from missing devices. If a smartphone or tablet is lost or stolen, its contents might be remotely erasable by the organization or its service provider, particularly if the device has cellular networking enabled.
- Erasing the contents prevents an attacker from obtaining any information from the device. The availability of this service depends on the capabilities of the product and the company providing network services for the product.

## Protection Options
- Each situation may require a different combination of protection options: for example, an organization might require one combination for SSL VPN access from BYOD PCs and another combination for access to an individual application from BYOD mobile devices.
- Teleworkers should follow their organizations’ requirements and recommendations for protecting sensitive information accessed with telework devices.
- Some organizations use the same requirements and recommendations for all types of information because of the difficulties in differentiating sensitive and nonsensitive information.

## Protecting Authenticators
- Teleworkers also need to ensure that they adequately protect their remote access-specific authenticators, such as passwords, personal identification numbers (PIN), and hardware tokens.
- Such authenticators should not be stored with the telework device, nor should multiple authenticators be stored with each other (e.g., a password or PIN should not be written on the back of a hardware token).# Telework Security Guidelines

## Understanding Social Engineering Threats
Teleworkers should be aware of how to handle threats involving social engineering, which is a general term for attackers trying to trick people into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions, such as downloading and executing files that appear to be benign but are actually malicious.

### Example of Social Engineering
For example, an attacker might approach a teleworker in a coffee shop and ask to use the computer for a minute or offer to help the teleworker with using the computer. Teleworkers should be wary of any requests they receive that could lead to a security breach or the theft of a telework device.

### Training and Awareness
Teleworkers should ask their organizations for training regarding how to recognize and handle social engineering attempts, if such training is not already being provided.

## Reporting Security Breaches
If a teleworker suspects that a security breach (including loss or theft of materials) has occurred involving a telework device, remote access communications, removable media, or other telework components, the teleworker should immediately follow the organization’s policy and procedures for reporting the possible breach.

### Importance of Reporting
This is particularly important if any of the affected telework components contain sensitive information such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), so that the potential impact of a security breach is minimized. Teleworkers should also contact the appropriate point of contact within the organization whenever they have questions or concerns related to telework security.

## Securing Home Networks and Using Other Networks
An important part of telework and remote access security is applying security measures to the home networks to which the telework device normally connects.

### Home Network Security
A major component of home network security is securing other PCs and mobile devices on the home network. If any of these devices become infected with malware or are otherwise compromised, they could be used to attack the telework device or eavesdrop on its communications.

### Device Security
Consequently, teleworkers should ensure that all devices on their home networks are secured properly. Teleworkers should also be cautious about allowing others to place devices on the teleworkers’ wired and wireless home networks, in case one of these devices has been or will be compromised.

### Risks of External Networks
Teleworkers also need to be aware of the risks of using external networks and of the procedures for connecting their telework devices, including Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) devices, to the organization’s own networks.

## Recommendations for Securing Networks
Sections 4.1 and 4.2 present recommendations for securing wired and wireless home networks, respectively. Section 4.3 briefly discusses the security implications of performing telework from external networks. (Many of the recommendations made in Sections 4.1 through 4.3 may be challenging for many users to implement. Users who are unsure of how to implement these recommendations should seek expert assistance.) Finally, Section 4.4 discusses issues regarding connecting BYOD devices to an organization’s own networks.

### 4.1 Wired Home Networks
Teleworkers should secure their wired home networks to help protect their telework devices. The most important part of securing most wired home networks is separating the home network from the network’s...# Internet Security for Teleworkers

## Overview
When teleworking, it is crucial to ensure that your devices are secure, especially when connecting to the Internet Service Provider (ISP).

## Risks of Direct Connection
If a telework device connects directly to the teleworker’s ISP, such as plugging the device directly into a cable modem, it becomes directly accessible from the Internet and is at a very high risk of being attacked.

## Recommended Security Measures
To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to have a security device between the ISP and the telework device. This is most commonly accomplished by using:

- **Broadband Router** (e.g., cable modem router)
- **Firewall Appliance**

### Configuration of Security Devices
The security device should be configured to prevent external computers from initiating communications with any devices on the home network, including the telework device.

Even if each device uses a personal firewall, an additional layer of security through a firewall appliance or broadband router is advisable. For instance, if a personal firewall on a computer malfunctions, the appliance or router would still protect the computer from unsolicited network communications from external sources.

### Protection Between Devices
In some cases, the appliance or router can also protect devices on the home network from each other by logically separating them. For example, a router with both wired and wireless interfaces might prevent the spread of certain types of malware from a device on the wireless network to a device on the wired network, depending on the router’s capabilities and configuration.

### Complexity of Configuration
However, such home network configurations can be complex to set up and maintain, so only users proficient in networking and security should consider implementing these configurations.

## Installation and Configuration Precautions
When installing and configuring firewall appliances, broadband routers, and similar devices, teleworkers should follow the security precautions outlined in the manufacturer’s documentation. Here are some examples of possible precautions:

- **Change Default Passwords**: Change default passwords on the device to prevent attackers from gaining access (lists of default passwords are widely available on the Internet).

- **Restrict External Administration**: Configure the device so that it cannot be administered from outside the home network, preventing external attackers from taking control.

- **Ignore Unsolicited Requests**: Configure the device to silently ignore unsolicited requests, which essentially hides the device from malicious parties. Teleworkers should check with their ISP before configuring a device this way, as it could interfere with necessary communications with the ISP’s infrastructure.

- **Regular Updates**: Check for updates and apply them periodically, as explained in the manufacturer’s documentation—either automatically (typically daily or weekly) or manually (to be performed by the teleworker at least monthly).

- **Disable Unused Wireless Access Points**: For broadband routers, turn off or disable built-in wireless access points (APs) that are not in use.

### Variability of Precautions
The proper precautionary measures for a firewall appliance, broadband router, etc., vary greatly from device to device, so some or all of these options may not be applicable to many devices.

## Wireless Home Networks
### [Section to be continued...]# Wireless Networking Security for Teleworkers

Wireless networking transfers information through the air between a telework device and a wireless access point (AP). If improperly configured, a wireless home network will transmit sensitive information without adequate protection, exposing it to other wireless devices in close proximity. Accordingly, teleworkers should secure their wireless home networks so that their remote access communications are protected.

## Security Recommendations

Teleworkers should follow the security recommendations from the documentation for the home network’s wireless AP. Assuming that the network is using Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 protocols, the following are examples of common security recommendations:

### 1. Use Strong Encryption

Use strong encryption to protect communications. An industry group called the Wi-Fi Alliance has created a series of product security certifications called Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), which include the WPA and WPA2 certifications. These certifications define sets of security requirements for wireless networking devices. Devices with wireless network cards that support either WPA or WPA2 can use their security features, such as encrypting network communications with the Advanced Encryption Security (AES) algorithm. Recommended choices, in order with the most preferred option first, are as follows:

- **WPA2 with AES**
- **WPA with AES**
- **WPA with Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)**

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is an earlier form of protection for wireless communications that has serious flaws. Attackers can easily circumvent WEP and gain access to the information being sent over the wireless network. If WEP is the only protection option available for a home network, users should configure it to use 128-bit encryption (which will somewhat slow attacks), use the organization’s secure remote access solution (e.g., VPN) to protect their remote access communications, and avoid sending any sensitive information unprotected.

### 2. Use a WPA2, WPA, or WEP Key

Use a WPA2, WPA, or WEP key (depending on the option selected above). This key is a series of characters (either a password composed of letters, digits, and punctuation, or a hexadecimal number) that is used to limit access to a wireless network. A wireless AP can be configured to require each device to provide the same key as the one stored in the AP. Devices that do not know the key cannot use the wireless network. The key should be long and complex, making it difficult for others to guess. This should help to prevent people near the AP from gaining unauthorized access to the network.

### 3. Permit Access for Specific Wireless Network Cards

Permit access for only particular wireless network cards. Some APs can be configured to allow only specific devices to use the wireless network. This is accomplished by identifying the media access control (MAC) address of each device’s wireless network card and entering the MAC address into a list on the AP. Because a MAC address should be unique to a particular network interface, specifying its MAC address in the AP can be helpful in preventing some unauthorized parties from gaining wireless network access. (Consult a device’s documentation to learn how to determine its MAC address.)# Teleworker Security Guidelines

## 1. Wireless Access Point (AP) Configuration

### 1.1 Change the Default Service Set Identifier (SSID)
- An SSID is a name assigned to a wireless AP that allows people and devices to distinguish one wireless network from another.
- Most APs come with a default SSID, often the manufacturer or product’s name. If this default SSID is not changed, devices may accidentally connect to the wrong network.
- Change the SSID to something unusual—not the default value or an obvious value (e.g., “SSID” or “wireless”)—to reduce the likelihood of connecting to the wrong network.

### 1.2 Disable SSID Broadcasts
- Many wireless APs broadcast the SSID, advertising the existence of the AP to nearby computers.
- Configuring an AP to not broadcast its SSID makes it less likely that people will inadvertently attempt to join the wireless network, although it does not prevent determined attackers.

### 1.3 Disable AP Administration Through Wireless Communications
- Flaws are often found in the administration utilities for wireless APs. If an AP has such a flaw, attackers nearby could reconfigure it to disable security features or gain access to the teleworker’s home network or the Internet.
- Teleworkers should configure APs to be administered locally (e.g., using a cable connection) rather than wirelessly or remotely.

## 2. External Networks

- Teleworkers should be aware that networks other than their home networks typically provide little protection for their devices and communications, such as when using a wireless hotspot at a coffee shop.
- External networks may not encrypt communications, making them susceptible to eavesdropping, especially on wireless networks.
- Devices on external networks are often directly accessible from the Internet. Some networks may offer partial protection by blocking specific types of malicious communications and checking for common threats like worms or spam.
- Since teleworkers cannot easily determine the level of protection provided by external networks, they should assume that third-party networks offer no protection.
- Telework devices on third-party networks are generally at a higher risk of being compromised, and their communications are more likely to be monitored.

### 2.1 Precautions Before Using Third-Party Networks
- Before using a third-party network, teleworkers should ensure their devices are fully updated (see Section 5.1 and Section 6). Updates should be retrieved over a trusted network, such as the user’s home network.
- When accessing organizational computing resources via a third-party network, teleworkers should use a VPN or other secure remote access solution provided by the organization and activate the secure remote access solution.# Establishing a VPN Session

Immediately after connecting to the third-party network, if applicable.

## 4.4 Organization Networks

Organizations may choose to permit BYOD devices to directly connect to networks within their facilities, such as using a wireless network within a user’s office building. Teleworkers who are interested in bringing BYOD devices into the office to use enterprise networks should first determine if the organization permits such network access, and if they do, then find out which network(s) the BYOD devices are allowed to use. Many organizations set up a dedicated BYOD network, usually wireless, and this network is the only one that BYOD devices can directly connect to. Teleworkers should not connect any BYOD devices to an organization’s internal networks without explicit permission to do so.

## 5. Securing BYOD Telework PCs

Teleworkers who use BYOD desktop or laptop PCs for telework should implement the recommendations presented in this section. These recommendations should be helpful in securing a PC’s OS and primary applications. Teleworkers who do not need to secure BYOD PCs may skip this section. Some of the recommendations made in this section may be challenging for many users to implement. Users who are unsure of how to implement these recommendations should seek expert assistance.

### 5.1 Software Updates

Many threats take advantage of vulnerabilities in software on PCs. Software manufacturers release updates for their software to eliminate these vulnerabilities. Accordingly, teleworkers should ensure that updates are applied regularly to the major software on their BYOD PCs. In addition to the OS, updating should include the following types of software:

- Web browsers
- Email clients
- Instant messaging clients
- Office productivity software (document viewers, word processors, spreadsheet tools, etc.)
- Antivirus software
- Personal firewalls

Teleworkers should review manufacturer documentation for each software program their PC contains in these categories to determine each program’s update capabilities. Most major software programs provide built-in mechanisms to update themselves automatically. Teleworkers should enable these features so that the programs check for updates at least weekly, preferably daily (especially for antivirus software and other security software).

For any programs that do not offer automatic updating, the teleworker should determine from the documentation other available options, such as running an update feature from the application’s menus every week or visiting the manufacturer’s website weekly for updates and downloading and installing any available updates.

For a PC with metered connectivity, such as a cellular modem, teleworkers should be cautious when configuring automatic software update features. Because many updates are very large, downloading them over metered networks could be quite costly. Large updates should be downloaded over non-metered networks.# Security Guidelines for Teleworkers

## Software Updates
Some software manufacturers offer updates at no charge, whereas others require an annual fee or other payment to receive updates, such as paying a subscription fee to get the latest antivirus signatures. Most software manufacturers that charge a fee allow users to pay it through the manufacturer’s website and receive updates within minutes of making payment.

## User Accounts and Sessions
A PC can be configured with user accounts and passwords to restrict who can use the PC. This section explains how teleworkers can configure their BYOD PCs to prevent unauthorized access to their applications and data.

### Use Accounts with Limited Privileges
On most operating systems (OSs), user accounts can have full privileges or limited privileges. Accounts with full privileges, also known as administrative accounts, should be used only when performing PC management tasks, such as installing updates and application software, managing user accounts, and modifying OS and application settings. If a PC is attacked while an administrative account is in use, the attack will be able to inflict more damage to the PC. Therefore, user accounts should be set up to have limited privileges; such accounts are known as daily use, limited, or standard user accounts. Teleworkers should not use administrative accounts for general tasks, such as reading email, web browsing, and social networking, because such tasks are common ways of infecting PCs with malware.

The primary disadvantages of having separate administrative and standard user accounts are that standard users might not be able to run some applications, especially ones designed for older OSs, or to install applications and OS or application updates. This could cause a significant delay in downloading and installing updates, as well as making other tasks less convenient for users. Some OSs have a feature that allows a person logged in as a standard user to perform individual administrative tasks by selecting a particular option.

Each person who uses the telework PC should have a separate standard user account. On most OSs, this keeps each person’s data and settings (e.g., files, stored emails, web browser bookmarks, and security settings) private from other people using the PC. It also helps limit how much damage certain attacks can cause, such as damaging only one user’s files, not all users’ files.

### Protect Accounts with Passwords
Each PC user account should have a password to prevent unauthorized people from using the PC—not only people with physical access to the PC, but also attackers attempting to contact the PC from other computers. Users should select strong passwords that cannot be guessed by attackers. The following are recommended practices for password selection:

- **Select a sufficiently long password.** Longer passwords are more difficult to guess than shorter passwords of similar complexity. The downside is that longer passwords are often more difficult for users to remember. Users should select passwords that are at least eight characters long. Passphrases, which are long passwords composed of multiple words, may be easier to remember than shorter, complex passwords.# Password Security Guidelines

## Creating Complex Passwords
- Create a complex password. A variety of characters should be part of the password.
- For example, a password made of all lower case letters is a relatively simple password, but another password of the same length made of upper and lower case letters, digits, and symbols (such as punctuation marks) is relatively complex.
- The more complex the password is, the more difficult it will be for others to guess.
- Users should select passwords containing digits and/or symbols in addition to letters.
- Users should not create new passwords that are very similar to old passwords. For example, if the old password was “dahlia*1”, the new password should not be “dahlia*2”.

## Avoiding Password Hints
- Do not use password hints.
- Password hints can be very helpful to people in guessing others’ passwords and using them to gain unauthorized access to a PC.
- Users should not use password hints unless their PCs do not need protection from people with physical access to them.

## Unique Passwords for Different Accounts
- Do not use the same password for other accounts.
- Teleworkers should not use the same password for multiple accounts, such as organization and personal email accounts, instant messaging accounts, and e-commerce website accounts.
- If the password used for the telework PC is also used for other user accounts and an attacker learned one of the passwords, the attacker could then access the other accounts.

## Regular Password Changes
- Teleworkers should change their passwords regularly, based on the interval specified in their organizations’ password policies.
- This is necessary because if a password is unknowingly revealed to an unauthorized person or uncovered by malware or other automated attacks, the password could be used without authorization until the teleworker changes the password.

## Managing Forgotten Passwords
- If an OS password is forgotten, especially for an administrative account, it may be difficult to regain access to the PC.
- Therefore, users should consider writing down their OS passwords and storing them in a physically secure location, such as a locked fire safe.
- Users should also safeguard their other passwords, such as application and website passwords.
- For example, some organizations provide cryptographic tokens to teleworkers that can be used to hold passwords.
- When the teleworker needs to retrieve a password, he or she authenticates to the token (such as entering a PIN into the token), and the token provides the password.
- The token helps prevent users from losing their passwords while also protecting the passwords from attackers.
- Another option for protecting application and website passwords is a password management utility, which is a program that can be used to generate, store, and access passwords securely.
- A teleworker typically enters a single password to gain access to all the passwords stored by the utility.

## Protecting User Sessions from Unauthorized Physical Access
- It is important that user sessions be protected against unauthorized physical access.
- For example, if a PC is sitting unattended in an area that other people can access, anyone could walk up to the PC and masquerade as the user, such as sending email from the user’s account, accessing the organization’s resources, etc.# Security Recommendations for PC Users

## 1. Introduction
Remote access resources, making purchases from websites, or accessing sensitive information stored on the PC can pose security risks. To prevent such events, most operating systems (OSs) allow users to lock the current session through menu options or a combination of keystrokes.

## 2. Locking the PC
Many OSs offer screensavers that activate automatically after the PC has been idle for a certain number of minutes, and can also be activated manually by the user on demand. Some of these screensavers can be configured to lock the PC and require the user to enter their password to unlock it.

### 2.1 Best Practices
If a PC will be left unattended in an accessible area at any time, users should:
- Use a password-protected screensaver.
- Manually lock their user sessions.

However, users should be aware that these security features provide only short-term protection; someone who has access to the PC for an extended period can bypass these features and gain access to the user’s session and data.

## 3. Networking Configuration
Most PCs can be configured to limit network access, which reduces the number of ways in which attackers can try to gain access to the PC. This section makes recommendations for configuring networking features to better protect the PC.

### 3.1 Disable Unneeded Networking Features
By default, most PCs provide several networking features that can facilitate communications and data sharing between PCs. Most teleworkers need to use only a few of these features.

#### 3.1.1 Recommendations
- Disable file and printer sharing services unless necessary.
- Disable IPv6 protocols and wireless networking protocols (e.g., Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, NFC) if not in use.
- Consult the PC’s hardware and OS documentation for guidance on which network features should be disabled; if still unsure, seek expert assistance.

### 3.2 Limit the Use of Remote Access Utilities
Some OSs offer features that allow teleworkers to get remote technical support assistance. While these features are convenient, they also increase the risk of unauthorized access.

#### 3.2.1 Recommendations
- Keep remote access utilities disabled at all times except when specifically needed.
- Configure utilities to require authentication (username and password) before granting access.
- Provide the username and password to the remote person in person, by phone, or by other secure means; do not send passwords through email or instant messaging.

### 3.3 Configure Wireless Networking
An improperly configured wireless network could transmit sensitive information.

## 4. Conclusion
By following these recommendations, users can significantly enhance the security of their PCs and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.# Teleworker Security Guidelines

## Wireless Network Security

Without protecting it properly, allowing people nearby to eavesdrop. Section 4.2 explains how to secure a wireless home network. In addition, PCs should be configured so that they do not automatically attempt to join wireless networks they detect. For example, a PC could join a neighbor’s wireless home network instead of the teleworker’s network; if that neighbor’s network is improperly secured, then the teleworker’s communications and computer could be at higher risk.

Therefore, teleworkers should configure their PCs so they do not join detected wireless networks automatically, with the exception of the organization’s own wireless networks, if such access is authorized. Teleworkers should also configure their PCs so that they cannot use ad hoc networking, which is a relatively easy way to attack a PC.

## Attack Prevention

As explained in Section 2, no 100 percent solution exists for computer security; it is simply not possible to thwart every single attack. PCs should use a combination of software and software features that will stop most attacks, particularly malware. The types of software described in this section are:

- Antivirus software
- Personal firewalls
- Spam and web content filtering
- Popup blocking

Changing a few settings on common applications, such as email clients and web browsers, can also stop some attacks. Although security tools can stop many attacks, teleworkers also need to practice safe computing habits.

One of the most common ways that PCs are attacked is by users opening and executing files from unknown and untrusted sources. Teleworkers may download these files from websites, file sharing services, or other means, or they may be sent to teleworkers through email, instant messaging, social media, and other communications services. These files often contain malware, and teleworkers unknowingly infect their PCs by trying to use these files. Teleworkers should avoid using any files that are coming from unknown and untrusted sources. Other people using a BYOD PC should also be made aware of safe computing habits.

### Install and Configure Antivirus Software

Antivirus software is specifically designed to detect many forms of malware and prevent them from infecting PCs, as well as cleaning PCs that have already been infected. Because malware is the most common threat against PCs, NIST recommends that PCs use antivirus software at all times. The antivirus software should be kept up-to-date, as described in Section 5.1.

Many brands of antivirus software are available, most of which offer similar functionality. NIST recommends configuring antivirus software to use the following types of functions:

- Automatically checking for and acquiring updates of signature or data definition files at least daily
- Scanning critical OS components, such as startup files, system basic input/output system (BIOS), and boot records
- Monitoring the behavior of common applications, such as email clients, web browsers, file transfer and file sharing programs, and instant messaging software
- Performing real-time scans of each file as it is downloaded, opened, or executed# Security Measures for Telework PCs

## Regular Scanning of Hard Drives
- Scanning all hard drives regularly to identify any file system infections, and optionally scanning removable media as well.
- Handling infected files by attempting to disinfect them (removing malware from within a file) and quarantining them (storing files containing malware in isolation for future disinfection or examination).
- Logging all significant events, such as:
- Results of scans
- Startup and shutdown of antivirus software
- Installation of updates
- Discovery and handling of any instances of malware

## Use Personal Firewalls
A personal firewall is a software program that monitors communications between a PC and other computers, blocking unwanted communications. Proper configuration of a personal firewall can significantly reduce the exposure of the PC to network-based attacks, such as worms and botnets.

### Importance of Personal Firewalls
- A personal firewall should be enabled on every telework PC.
- It protects shared resources on a PC, such as file and print shares.
- Personal firewalls should be configured to log significant events, including:
- Blocked and allowed activity
- Startup and shutdown of the firewall software
- Firewall configuration changes

### Configuration Considerations
- Personal firewalls can monitor incoming communications, and some can also monitor outbound communications, which offers better security but may cause issues with certain applications.
- If configured too restrictively, a personal firewall could prevent some applications or OS functions from working correctly (e.g., file and print services).
- Conversely, if configured too permissively, it could allow attacks to compromise the PC.

### Best Practices for Configuration
- Teleworkers should read their personal firewall documentation carefully to understand how to configure it properly.
- If unclear, teleworkers should seek expert guidance on configuring their personal firewalls.
- Ideally, personal firewalls should deny all types of communications that teleworkers have not specifically approved, known as a "deny by default" configuration.
- Most firewalls can be configured to allow communications based on lists of authorized applications (e.g., web browsers contacting web servers, email clients sending and receiving messages).
- Communications involving any other application are either denied automatically or permitted based on the teleworker's response to prompts regarding the activity.

### Challenges with Personal Firewalls
- Personal firewalls often do not provide a seamless experience, and their configuration can be problematic, especially when dealing with new applications.# Network Security for Teleworkers

## Introduction
Teleworkers often face challenges in determining whether network activity is benign or malicious. This guide provides essential information on managing network security effectively.

## Understanding Network Activity
- Teleworkers may struggle to identify which application is using the network.
- Unclear activity can lead to cautious teleworkers blocking legitimate applications.
- Conversely, allowing access without verification can support malicious activities.

### Recommendations for Teleworkers
- When uncertain, teleworkers should:
- Search for additional information about the service or software in question.
- Consult someone with more security expertise for assistance.

## Firewall Management
### Single Firewall Usage
- Each PC should only have one personal firewall enabled to avoid interference.
- Multiple firewalls can:
- Allow conflicting activities.
- Slow down PC performance.
- Cause applications to malfunction.
- Weaken overall security.

### Firewall Configuration
- Ensure the firewall is enabled for all network interfaces, including:
- VPNs
- Wired connections
- Wireless connections
- Virtual network cards

### Additional Security Features
- Many personal firewalls offer features such as:
- Password protection for configuration settings to prevent unauthorized changes.

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Firewalls frequently block unwanted activities, such as:
- Worms and malware attempting to infect PCs.
- Teleworkers should not be alarmed by firewall notifications about blocked connections or scans, as these do not indicate infection.

## Content Filtering Software
### Overview of Content Filtering
- Content filtering monitors communications (e.g., email, web pages) for suspicious content.
- It prevents the delivery of harmful content to users.

### Types of Content Filtering
1. **Spam Filtering Software**
- Analyzes emails for spam characteristics.
- Places suspected spam in a separate folder.
- Reduces the amount of spam reaching users, though some legitimate emails may be misclassified.

2. **Web Content Filtering Software**
- Monitors web pages for harmful content.

### Customization Options for Spam Filtering
- Users can refine spam filtering through:
- **Blacklists**: Lists of email senders known for sending spam.

## Conclusion
By following these guidelines, teleworkers can enhance their network security and reduce the risk of malicious activities while working remotely.# Spam and Web Content Filtering

## Spam Filtering Techniques

### Blacklists
A blacklist is a list of email addresses from which future emails will be classified as spam automatically. If a user receives a spam message, they can request that the sender’s email address be added to this list.

### Whitelists
A whitelist is a list of email senders that are known to be benign, such as coworkers, friends, and family. Users can add email addresses to a whitelist, ensuring that future emails from these trusted senders are not classified as spam. This helps to prevent accidental classification of benign emails as spam.

### Bayesian Spam Filters
A Bayesian spam filter determines the likelihood that a particular email message is spam by comparing the email’s characteristics with those of previously received spam messages. Users can correct any errors made by the spam filtering software, allowing the Bayesian filter to analyze both benign and spam messages to record their characteristics. For example, if a user has received 35 spam messages containing the phrase “FREE FREE FREE” but no benign messages with that phrase, the filter will assign a higher spam probability to new emails containing that phrase.

## Web Content Filtering

Web content filtering software works by comparing a website address that a user attempts to access with a list of known bad websites. While the primary purpose is to prevent access to inappropriate materials, many filters also include lists of hostile websites that may distribute malware or host phishing attempts. However, web content filtering software may inadvertently classify benign content as inappropriate or vice versa.

### Recommendations
From a telework PC security perspective, it is strongly recommended to use spam content filtering and web content filtering technologies. All content filtering products should be kept up-to-date to ensure accurate detection.

## Primary Application Configuration

Many attacks, particularly malware, exploit features provided by common applications such as email clients, web browsers, instant messaging clients, and office productivity suites. By default, these applications are often configured to favor functionality over security.

### Best Practices for Teleworkers
Teleworkers should consider the following best practices:
- Disable unneeded features and capabilities from applications, especially those commonly exploited by malware.
- Configure applications to filter content and stop activities that are likely to be malicious.

### Application Settings
Teleworkers should be aware that a single PC might have multiple web browsers, email clients, instant messaging clients, and office productivity suites installed, each of which may require individual configuration for optimal security.# Teleworking Security Guidelines

## Overview
Teleworkers should consider their organization’s policies regarding application use. Many organizations forbid the use of peer-to-peer software and file sharing programs on organization computers due to the increased security risks associated with such software. To better protect the organization’s information, teleworkers should remove any forbidden software from their telework computers. In general, teleworkers should install and use only known and trusted software on their BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) PCs.

## 5.5.1 Web Browsers
Teleworkers should consider adopting the following recommendations for the web browsers on their BYOD PCs:

### Use a Different Brand of Web Browser for Telework
- Multiple brands of web browsers (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer or Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, etc.) can be installed on a single PC.
- Accessing websites containing malicious content is one of the most common ways for PCs to be attacked, such as spyware plug-ins being installed in a browser.
- To reduce the likelihood of such attacks impacting telework, teleworkers can use one brand of browser for telework only and another brand for all other website access.
- This separation provides better protection for telework-related data, although it cannot adequately secure browser data on its own.
- Having a separate brand of browser for telework also allows the teleworker to secure it more tightly.

### Block Popup Windows
- Web browsers support the use of popup windows, which are standalone web browser panes that open automatically when a web page is loaded or a user performs an action designed to trigger a popup window.
- Many popup windows contain advertising, but some are used to attack computers.
- Some popup windows are crafted to resemble legitimate system message boxes or websites and can trick users into visiting phony websites, including phishing sites, or authorizing changes to their computers.
- For example, a popup window may inform a user that their computer is infected with spyware and prompt them to click OK to disinfect it. By clicking OK, the user unwittingly permits spyware or other types of malware to be installed on their computer.
- To control popup windows, teleworkers should either configure their web browsers to block them or use third-party popup blocking utilities.
- Both options prevent popup windows from opening and indicate to the teleworker that a popup window was blocked. If the teleworker did not want the window to be blocked, they could choose to permit that particular popup window or all popup windows from a trusted website, such as the organization’s remote access website.

### Enable Phishing Filter Capabilities
- Most browsers can detect possible phishing attempts and warn users accordingly.

By following these guidelines, teleworkers can enhance their security and protect sensitive organizational information while working remotely.# Security Recommendations for Teleworkers

## Web Browsers

Teleworkers should implement the following security measures for their web browsers:

### 1. Enable Phishing Filters
- Check the browser’s documentation to see if it offers a phishing filter, and if so, enable it.

### 2. Remove Unneeded Browser Plug-ins
- Review the plug-ins installed in the browser periodically.
- Uninstall all plug-ins that are unneeded or unknown.
- If a necessary plug-in is accidentally uninstalled, the user will typically be prompted to download and install it again when accessing relevant content.

### 3. Protect Sensitive Information
- Browsers may store sensitive information such as cached passwords, digital certificates, and encryption keys.
- Check if the browser offers options for strong protection of this information, such as requiring a master password.
- If available, enable this option and set a master password.

### 4. Prevent Automatic Password Recall
- Configure the browser to avoid using auto-fill or auto-complete functions for usernames and passwords.
- This prevents unauthorized access to various websites by someone else using the teleworker's device.

### 5. Run Browsers with Least Privileges
- Use a mode that offers low privileges to limit the impact of potential attacks.
- This helps prevent some attacks from succeeding and limits damage if they do.

### 6. Use Third-Party Security and Privacy Enhancing Plug-ins
- Consider using plug-ins that improve security and privacy, such as:
- Preventing automatic execution of active content.
- Stopping tracking techniques across websites.
- Blocking unwanted advertising content.

## Email Clients

Teleworkers should consider the following recommendations for each email client on their BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) PCs:

### 1. Limit Mobile Code Execution
- Be aware that email messages can carry malicious mobile code that may attempt to infect the device.
- Implement measures to prevent infections from mobile code executed through email messages.# Email Security Recommendations for Teleworkers

## Email Clients
Teleworkers should consider the following recommendations for configuring their email clients:

- **Disable Mobile Code Support**: Configure email clients to permit only the required forms of mobile code (e.g., JavaScript, ActiveX, Java, etc.). It is advisable to disable mobile code support, understanding that some benign email messages may not display fully.

- **Set Default Message Formats**: Set the default message reading and sending format to plain text. Many email clients allow users to specify the default format. Since malware and phishing attacks often exploit HTML features, using plain text is preferable. This ensures emails are displayed as text only, omitting pictures, hyperlinks, and other HTML content. Sending emails as plain text is also beneficial for security-conscious users.

- **Disable Automatic Previewing**: Configure email clients to prevent automatic previewing and opening of email messages. Some email-based malware can activate when a malicious email is previewed or opened. By disabling this feature, teleworkers can identify and delete suspicious emails based on sender, recipient, subject, and other identifying information without viewing the entire email.

- **Enable Spam Filtering**: Implement spam filtering to help manage unwanted emails. Refer to Section 5.4.3 for additional information on this topic.

## Instant Messaging Clients
Teleworkers should consider the following recommendations for each instant messaging client on their BYOD PCs:

- **Suppress Display of Email Addresses**: If the teleworker’s displayed name or supporting information includes an email address, it may be harvested by malware or malicious users for future attacks.

- **Restrict File Transfers**: Configure the software to prompt the teleworker before allowing a file transfer to begin. File transfers are a common method for spreading malware to other computers.

## Office Productivity Suites
Teleworkers should consider the following recommendations for each office productivity suite on their BYOD PCs:

- **Restrict Macro Use**: Applications like word processors and spreadsheets often contain macro languages that certain types of malware exploit. Most common applications with macro capabilities offer security features that allow macros only from trusted locations or prompt the user to approve or reject each attempt to run a macro. This prompting feature can effectively stop macro-based malware threats.# Teleworking Security Guidelines

## Limiting Personal Information
- **Limit personal information.** Many office productivity tools allow personal information, such as name, initials, mailing address, and phone number, to be stored with each document created. Although the most basic information (typically, name and initials) are often needed for collaboration features and edit tracking, information such as mailing addresses and phone numbers is not. Personal information becomes embedded within document files and may inadvertently be distributed with files to others. Teleworkers should not enter any more personal information than necessary into the user settings of office productivity tools. For some word processors, teleworkers can use sanitization utilities that remove personal information from documents, as well as comments, tracked changes, and other information that might be embedded in documents but should not be part of the final document.

## Using Secured Folders for Application Files
- **Use secured folders for application files.** Most office productivity applications allow users to define default locations for saving documents and holding temporary files, including auto-save and backup copies of documents. This can be very helpful at protecting application files from unauthorized access by others. Teleworkers should also store their custom dictionary entries in a user-specific file stored in one of their protected folders.

## Remote Access Software Configuration
As described in Section 2, teleworkers may have to install remote access software onto their BYOD PCs or configure software built into the PC’s OS. This software should be configured based on the organization’s requirements and recommendations. In many cases, the remote access software will be preconfigured by the organization so that teleworkers do not have to be concerned about configuring it. In general, remote access software should be configured so that only the necessary functions are enabled. Teleworkers should also ensure that whenever updates to the remote access software are available, they are acquired and installed. If the organization provides the updates, teleworkers should make sure that they will be notified when updates are available.

## Security Maintenance and Monitoring
Teleworkers should maintain their BYOD PCs’ security on an ongoing basis. Common responsibilities are as follows:
- **Confirming periodically that the OS and primary applications are up-to-date.** Many software programs have a menu option or other mechanism that displays the update status, such as the number of updates that have not yet been applied or the most recent date the software was updated.
- **Checking the status of security software periodically** to ensure that it is still enabled, configured properly, and up-to-date. Some operating systems offer security dashboards that show the current status of the security software. Checking the software’s status should also include verifying that the regular scans performed by antivirus software have not found any infections on the PC. If an infection is still present, the teleworker should follow the antivirus software’s instructions for disinfecting the system.# Telework Security Guidelines

## User Account Management
- Creating a new user account whenever another person needs to start using the PC, as well as disabling or deleting a user account whenever the associated person no longer needs to use the PC.
- All user accounts should be reviewed periodically to ensure that only the necessary accounts are enabled.

## Password Management
- Changing the teleworker’s PC password regularly in accordance with the organization’s password policy.

## Security Issue Identification
- Periodically identifying security issues on the PC. Some operating systems (OSs) offer utilities that can be run to check the PC for potential problems.
- These utilities can identify missing software updates and incorrect security settings and can provide recommendations for fixing problems.
- However, understanding the reports that these utilities produce and properly implementing recommended solutions can require someone with considerable security expertise.
- Teleworkers without sufficient expertise should seek expert assistance before implementing any unclear recommendations.

## Investigating Unusual Behavior
- Teleworkers also need to investigate any cases in which the PC begins to display unusual behavior.
- Generally, the best first step is to ensure that the computer’s software (especially antivirus software) is fully up-to-date; then, the entire computer should be scanned using the antivirus software.
- If any malware is detected, it should be removed using the antivirus software; if no malware is detected, then the next step should be to reboot the computer, which clears many errors.
- If that is ineffective, then additional troubleshooting steps need to be performed. Examples are as follows:
- Checking antivirus manufacturer websites for instances of malware that cause the unusual behavior being seen.
- Uninstalling and reinstalling an application that is not functioning properly.
- Searching the OS manufacturer’s website for information on similar problems.
- Using troubleshooting utilities that can provide insights into what is happening on the PC.

## Seeking Expert Assistance
- If the problem still cannot be resolved, or the teleworker does not have sufficient knowledge to perform these troubleshooting steps, the teleworker should seek expert assistance, such as contacting the organization’s help desk if the organization provides support for BYOD PCs.
- Teleworkers can assist with troubleshooting by collecting and documenting information regarding the problems.
- Some OSs provide features that automate this process, and some PC manufacturers install utilities on their PCs designed specifically for this purpose.
- Teleworkers should consult the PC’s hardware and OS manuals for information regarding such features.
- Teleworkers also should preserve error messages by performing a screen capture, copying and pasting the error message into a file or email, or writing down the error message verbatim on paper.
- (The appropriate technique should be selected based on the complexity of the error message and the PC’s support for performing screen captures, if any.)

## Securing BYOD Telework Mobile Devices
- Teleworkers who use BYOD mobile devices for telework, particularly smartphones and tablets, should implement the recommendations presented in this section.

Mobile devices can skip this section. A wide variety of mobile devices exist, and the security features available for these devices also vary widely. Some devices offer only a few basic features, whereas others offer sophisticated features similar to those offered by PCs. This does not necessarily imply that more security features are better; in fact, many devices offer more security features because the capabilities they provide make them more susceptible to attack than devices without these capabilities.

In general, mobile devices currently face fewer threats than PCs, but threats against mobile devices are increasing. The variety in security features makes it infeasible to create specific recommendations that apply to all mobile devices; therefore, teleworkers should consult the documentation provided by their device manufacturers and service providers (e.g., cellular service) and follow their security recommendations.

## General Recommendations

1. **Limit Access to the Device**
- Most mobile devices allow the owner to restrict access by setting a PIN or password; some also support more sophisticated authentication mechanisms, such as biometrics (e.g., the owner’s thumbprint).
- Using some sort of authenticator prevents or deters access to the teleworker’s information and service by a person who gains unauthorized physical access to the device.
- Some devices can also be configured to lock themselves automatically after an idle period; a person attempting to use the device when it is locked must authenticate again to unlock it.
- PINs and passwords should be changed periodically and whenever teleworkers suspect that someone else may know them. Each PIN or password should be unique and not used elsewhere, either currently or previously, to prevent a PIN or password from being compromised by someone and then used to gain access to additional devices, applications, websites, etc.

2. **Disable Unnecessary Networking Capabilities**
- Many mobile devices offer multiple types of networking capabilities, such as IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, and NFC.
- Attackers can try to use these capabilities to access information on the device or use the device’s services. This can be prevented by disabling each networking capability that is not used, and by enabling necessary capabilities only when they are going to be used.
- For example, if a person only uses a Bluetooth earpiece occasionally with a smartphone, then the teleworker could enable the smartphone’s Bluetooth capability only when the teleworker wants to use the earpiece and disable it when the teleworker is done with the earpiece.
- Each enabled networking capability increases the risk of successful attacks, so teleworkers should consider the relative risk of each form of networking before enabling it (for example, enabling Bluetooth in a crowded public area is generally riskier than enabling it in a private home).

3. **Keep Devices Updated**
- Most mobile devices can be updated or patched to eliminate known security flaws. Devices that support updating may do so directly (e.g., the teleworker selects an option on the device).# Mobile Device Security Guidelines for Teleworkers

## Updating Devices
- **Direct Updates**: Teleworkers can update their devices directly (e.g., using a device to get an update) or indirectly (e.g., downloading a patch onto a PC and then installing it onto the mobile device through a data cable).
- **Regular Updates**: If a device supports updating, teleworkers should follow the provided instructions to ensure that security updates are identified, acquired, and installed regularly, at least weekly. See Section 5.1 for information on acquiring updates through metered networks.

## Application Configuration
- **Security Configuration**: Many applications on mobile devices, such as web browsers, are often configured by default to favor functionality over security. Teleworkers should consider:
- Disabling unneeded application features.
- Configuring applications to stop or block activity that is likely to be malicious.
- **Recommendations**: Section 5.5 provides configuration recommendations for web browsers, email clients, and instant messaging clients on personal computers; these recommendations should also be applied to mobile devices to the extent possible.

## Downloading Applications
- **Authorized Sources**: Teleworkers should download and run apps only from authorized app stores. Caution is advised when downloading and installing software that is not provided by either the organization or the device’s manufacturer.
- **Risks of Unfamiliar Software**: Downloading software from unfamiliar websites could reduce the security of the device or contain malware that would infect the device. Such software could also disrupt other applications, including security software.

## Device Integrity
- **Avoid Jailbreaking or Rooting**: Teleworkers should not jailbreak or root their devices, as this disables the manufacturer’s built-in security capabilities. Many organizations automatically check mobile devices attempting to access their networks for signs of jailbreaking or rooting and deny access to such devices.

## Charging Precautions
- **Unknown Charging Stations**: Teleworkers should not connect their devices to unknown charging stations. Altered charging stations, especially in public areas, may attempt to gain unauthorized access to the data, applications, services, and other resources on mobile devices.

## Secure Access Environment
- **Isolated and Encrypted Environment**: Teleworkers should use an isolated, protected, and encrypted environment that is supported and managed by the organization to access the organization’s data and services.
- Such environments are generally automatically generated and maintained on mobile devices, isolating the organization’s stored data, applications, and other files while maintaining control without accessing the teleworker’s personal information.
- **Caution with Synchronization**: Teleworkers should be cautious about connecting mobile devices to other computers, such as synchronizing data between a smartphone and a PC, as malware could be transmitted during synchronization.# Security Considerations for Teleworkers

## 1. Risks of Transferring Sensitive Information

Transferring sensitive information from one device to another can expose that information to higher risks, especially if the second device is not adequately protected. Before connecting a mobile device to another computer, teleworkers should ensure that both devices have been properly secured.

## 2. Considering the Security of Third-Party Devices

Teleworkers sometimes need to perform remote access from devices owned by third parties, such as checking email from a kiosk computer at a conference. However, when a third party is responsible for securing a device, teleworkers typically do not know if it has been secured properly. This uncertainty can lead to accessing compromised devices, which may be infected with malware designed to steal sensitive information, such as passwords or email messages.

### 2.1 Organizational Policies on Third-Party Devices

Many organizations either prohibit the use of third-party devices for remote access or allow only limited use, such as for webmail. If an organization permits the use of third-party devices for telework, teleworkers should carefully consider the security of the device before using it.

### 2.2 Risks of Using Third-Party BYOD Devices

There is generally more risk associated with using third-party Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) devices compared to teleworker-owned devices due to the uncertainty surrounding their security. However, some third-party devices may be reasonably secured. Teleworkers should evaluate:

- Who is responsible for securing the third-party device.
- Who can access the device.

For instance, a kiosk provided at a conference for attendees is likely to be more secure than one located in a hotel lobby accessible to the general public.

### 2.3 Recommendations for Teleworkers

Whenever possible, teleworkers should avoid using publicly accessible devices for telework, including remote access to email and other applications. They should refrain from using any third-party devices for sensitive functions or accessing sensitive information. If a teleworker is not reasonably confident in the security of a third-party device, they should exercise caution and avoid using it altogether. Many teleworkers opt not to use any third-party secured devices for remote access due to these security concerns.
