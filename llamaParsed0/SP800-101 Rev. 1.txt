# Mobile Device Forensics Guide

## Abstract
Mobile device forensics is the science of recovering digital evidence from a mobile device under forensically sound conditions using accepted methods. Mobile device forensics is an evolving specialty in the field of digital forensics. This guide attempts to bridge the gap by providing an in-depth look into mobile devices and explaining technologies involved and their relationship to forensic procedures. This document covers mobile devices with features beyond simple voice communication and text messaging capabilities. This guide also discusses procedures for the validation, preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information.

## Executive Summary
The digital forensic community faces a constant challenge to stay abreast of the latest technologies that may be used to expose relevant clues in an investigation. Mobile devices are commonplace in today’s society, used by many individuals for both personal and professional purposes. Mobile devices vary in design and are continually undergoing change as existing technologies improve and new technologies are introduced.

When a mobile device is encountered during an investigation, many questions arise:
- What is the best method to preserve the evidence?
- How should the device be handled?
- How should valuable or potentially relevant data contained on the device be extracted?

The key to answering these questions begins with a firm understanding of the hardware and software characteristics of mobile devices. This guide discusses procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital evidence. The issue of ever-increasing backlogs for most digital forensics labs is addressed, and guidance is provided on handling on-site triage casework.

The objective of the guide is twofold:
1. To help organizations evolve appropriate policies and procedures for dealing with mobile devices.
2. To prepare forensic specialists to conduct forensically sound examinations involving mobile devices.

This guide is not all-inclusive nor is it prescribing how law enforcement and incident response communities should handle mobile devices during their investigations or incidents. Specific vendors and mobile forensic acquisition guidance is not specified. However, from the principles outlined and other information provided, organizations should find this guide helpful in establishing their policies and procedures.

This publication should not be construed as legal advice. Organizations should use this guide as a starting point for developing a forensic capability in conjunction with proper technical training and extensive guidance provided by legal advisors, officials, and management. This guide is the first revision to NIST SP800-101. While much of the information provided herein has been carried over from the original guide, the material has been updated and augmented to reflect the current state of the discipline.# Mobile Forensics Guide

## 2. Background
This chapter gives an overview of the hardware and software capabilities of mobile devices and their associated cellular networks. The overview provides a summary of general characteristics and, where useful, focuses on key features relevant to forensics. Developing an understanding of the components and organization of mobile devices (e.g., memory organization and its use) is a prerequisite to understanding the intricacies involved when dealing with them forensically.

For example, mobile device memory that contains user data may be volatile (i.e., DRAM/SRAM) and require continuous power to maintain content similar to RAM in a personal computer. Similarly, features of cellular networks are an important aspect of mobile device forensics, since logs of usage, geographic location, and other data are maintained. Mobile device technologies and cellular networks are rapidly changing, with new technologies, products, and features being introduced regularly. Because of the fast pace with which mobile device technologies are evolving, this discussion captures a snapshot of the mobile device discipline at the present time.

### 2.1 Mobile Device Characteristics
Mobile devices perform an array of functions ranging from a simple telephony device to those of a personal computer. Designed for mobility, they are compact in size, battery-powered, and lightweight. Most mobile devices have a basic set of comparable features and capabilities. They house a microprocessor, read-only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), a radio module, a digital signal processor, a microphone and speaker, a variety of hardware keys and interfaces, and a liquid crystal display (LCD).

The operating system (OS) of a mobile device may be stored in either NAND or NOR memory while code execution typically occurs in RAM. Currently, mobile devices are equipped with system-level microprocessors that reduce the number of supporting chips required and include considerable internal memory.# Mobile Device Capabilities

## Memory Capacity
- Currently up to 64GB (e.g., Stacked NAND).
- Built-in Secure Digital (SD) memory card slots, such as one for the micro Secure Digital eXtended Capacity (microSDXC), may support removable memory with capacities ranging from 64GB to 2TB of storage.

## Wireless Communications
- Non-cellular wireless communications such as:
- Infrared (i.e., IrDA)
- Bluetooth
- Near Field Communication (NFC)
- WiFi
- These may also support synchronization protocols to exchange other data (e.g., graphics, audio, and video file formats).

## Device Characteristics
- Different mobile devices have different technical and physical characteristics (e.g., size, weight, processor speed, memory capacity).
- Mobile devices may also use different types of expansion capabilities to provide additional functionality.
- Mobile device capabilities sometimes include those of other devices such as:
- Handheld Global Positioning Systems (GPS)
- Cameras (still and video)
- Personal computers

## Classification of Mobile Devices
- Mobile devices can be classified as:
- **Feature Phones**: Primarily simple voice and messaging communication devices.
- **Smartphones**: Offer more advanced capabilities and services for multimedia, similar to those of a personal computer.

### Hardware Characteristics
- Table 1 highlights the general hardware characteristics of feature and smartphone models, which underscore this diversity.
- The classification scheme is illustrative and intended to give a sense of the range of hardware characteristics currently in the marketplace.
- Over time, characteristics found in smartphones tend to appear in feature phones as new technology is introduced to smartphones.

### Dynamic Classification
- Though the lines of delineation are somewhat fuzzy and dynamic, the classification scheme serves as a general guide.

## Basic Functionality
- Both feature phones and smartphones support:
- Voice
- Text messaging
- A set of basic Personal Information Management (PIM) type applications including phonebook and calendar facilities.

## Advanced Capabilities of Smartphones
- Smartphones add PC-like capability for running a wide variety of general and special-purpose applications.
- Typically larger than feature phones, support higher video resolutions (e.g., ~300 PPI), and may have:
- An integrated QWERTY keyboard
- Touch sensitive screen
- Generally support a wide array of applications, available through an application storefront.

### Software Capabilities
- Table 2 lists the differences in software capabilities found on these device classes.

## Operating Systems
- Feature phones typically use a closed operating system with no published documentation.
- A number of companies specializing in embedded software also offer real-time operating system solutions for manufacturers of mobile devices.
- Smartphones generally use either a proprietary or an open-source operating system.
- Nearly all smartphones use one of the following operating systems:
- Android
- BlackBerry OS
- iOS
- Symbian
- WebOS
- Windows Phone
- Unlike the more limited kernels in feature phones, these operating systems are multi-tasking.# Mobile Device Memory Considerations

## Overview
Mobile devices are designed to be tasking and full-featured, specifically to match the capabilities of high-end mobile devices. Many smartphone operating system manufacturers offer a Software Development Kit (SDK), such as the Android or iOS SDKs.

## 2.2 Memory Considerations

### Types of Memory
Mobile devices contain both non-volatile and volatile memory:

- **Volatile Memory (RAM)**: Used for dynamic storage; its contents are lost when power is drained from the mobile device.
- **Non-Volatile Memory**: Persistent memory whose contents are not affected by loss of power or data overwriting upon reboot. An example is solid-state drives (SSD) that store persistent data on solid-state flash memory.

### Flash Memory Types
Mobile devices typically contain one or two different types of non-volatile flash memory:

- **NOR Flash**:
- Faster read times
- Slower write times than NAND
- Nearly immune to corruption and bad blocks
- Allows random access to any memory location

- **NAND Flash**:
- Offers higher memory storage capacities
- Less stable
- Only allows sequential access

### Evolution of Memory Configurations
Memory configurations among mobile devices have evolved over time:

1. **First Generation**:
- Feature phones contained NOR flash and RAM memory.
- System and user data were stored in NOR and copied to RAM upon booting for faster code execution.

2. **Second Generation**:
- Introduced with smartphones, adding NAND flash memory.
- System files stored in NOR flash, user files in NAND, and RAM used for code execution.

3. **Third Generation**:
- Latest smartphones contain only NAND and RAM memory.
- Driven by requirements for higher transaction speed, greater storage density, and lower cost.
- New Embedded MultiMedia Cards (eMMC) style chips are present in many of today’s smartphones, facilitating higher density storage (i.e., 2GB – 128GB).

### RAM Capture Challenges
RAM is the most difficult to capture accurately due to its volatile nature. Since RAM is typically used for program execution, information may be valuable to the examiner (e.g., configuration files, passwords, etc.). Mobile device RAM capture tools are just beginning to become available.

### Data Storage in Flash Memory
- **NOR Flash Memory**:
- Includes system data such as operating system code, the kernel, device drivers, system libraries, memory for executing operating system applications, and storage of user application execution instructions.
- Best location for data collection for first generation memory configuration devices.

- **NAND Flash Memory**:
- Contains PIM data, graphics, audio, video, and other user data.# Memory and Identity Module Characteristics

## 1. NAND Flash Memory

This type of memory generally provides the examiner with the most useful information in most cases. NAND flash memory may leave multiple copies of transaction-based files (e.g., databases and logs) due to wear leveling algorithms and garbage collection routines.

Since NAND flash memory cells can be reused for only a limited amount of time before they become unreliable, wear leveling algorithms are used to increase the lifespan of Flash memory storage by arranging data so that erasures and rewrites are distributed evenly across the SSD.

Garbage collection occurs because NAND flash memory cannot overwrite existing data; the data must first be erased before writing to the same cell [Bel10].

## 2. Identity Module Characteristics

Identity modules (commonly known as SIM cards) are synonymous with mobile devices that interoperate with GSM cellular networks. Under the GSM framework, a mobile device is referred to as a Mobile Station and is partitioned into two distinct components: the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) and the Mobile Equipment (ME).

### 2.1 UICC Overview

A UICC, commonly referred to as an identity module (e.g., Subscriber Identity Module [SIM], Universal Subscriber Identity Module [USIM], CDMA Subscriber Identity Module [CSIM]), is a removable component that contains essential information about the subscriber. The ME and the radio handset portion cannot fully function without a UICC.

The UICC’s main purpose entails authenticating the user of the mobile device to the network providing access to subscribed services. The UICC also offers storage for personal information, such as phonebook entries, text messages, last numbers dialed (LND), and service-related information.

### 2.2 Portability of UICC

The UICC partitioning of a mobile device stipulated in the GSM standards has brought about a form of portability. Moving a UICC between compatible mobile devices automatically transfers the subscriber’s identity and some of the associated information (e.g., SMS messages and contacts) and capabilities.

In contrast, 2G and 3G CDMA mobile devices generally do not contain a UICC card. Analogous UICC functionality is instead directly incorporated within the device. However, newer CDMA (i.e., 4G/LTE) devices may employ a CDMA Subscriber Identity Module (CSIM) application running on a UICC.

### 2.3 Applications of UICC

A UICC can contain up to three applications: SIM, USIM, and CSIM. UICCs used in GSM and UMTS mobile devices use the SIM and UMTS SIM (USIM) applications, while CDMA devices use the CSIM application.

A UICC with all three applications provides users with additional portability through the removal of the UICC from one mobile device and insertion into another. Because the SIM application was originally synonymous with the physical card itself, the term SIM is often used to refer to the physical card in lieu of UICC. Similarly, the terms USIM and CSIM can refer to both the physical card as well as the respective applications supported on the UICC.

### 2.4 Technical Specifications

At its core, a UICC is a special type of smart card that typically contains a processor and...# UICC Overview

## Memory and Storage
The UICC (Universal Integrated Circuit Card) contains between 16 to 128 KB of persistent electronically erasable, programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). It also includes RAM for program execution and ROM for the operating system, user authentication, data encryption algorithms, and other applications.

### File System
The UICC’s file system resides in persistent memory and stores data such as:
- Phonebook entries
- Text messages
- Last numbers dialed (LND)
- Service-related information

Depending on the mobile device used, some information managed by applications on the UICC may coexist in the memory of the mobile device. Information may also reside entirely in the memory of the mobile device instead of the available memory reserved for it in the file system of the UICC.

## Operating System and Access Control
The UICC operating system controls access to elements of the file system. Actions such as reading or updating may be permitted or denied unconditionally, or allowed conditionally with certain access rights, depending on the application. Rights are assigned to a subscriber through 4-8 digit Personal Identification Number (PIN) codes.

### PIN and PUK
PINs protect core subscriber-related data and certain optional data. A preset number of attempts (usually three) are allowed for providing the correct PIN code to the UICC before further attempts are blocked completely, rendering communications inoperative.

Only by providing a correct PIN Unblocking Key (PUK) may the value of a PIN and its counter be reset on the UICC. If the number of attempts to enter the correct PUK value exceeds a set limit, normally ten, the card becomes blocked permanently. The PUK for a UICC may be obtained from the service provider or network operator by providing the identifier of the UICC (i.e., Integrated Circuit Chip Identifier or ICCID). The ICCID is normally imprinted on the front of the UICC but may also be read from an element of the file system.

## UICC Formats
UICCs are available in three different size formats:
- **Mini SIM (2FF)**: 25 mm x 15 mm x 0.76 mm
- **Micro SIM (3FF)**: 12 mm x 15 mm x 0.76 mm
- **Nano SIM (4FF)**: 8.8 mm x 12.3 mm x 0.67 mm

The Mini SIM is currently the most common format used worldwide. Micro and Nano SIMs are found in newer mobile devices (e.g., iPhone 5 uses the 4FF).

## Design and Security
Though similar in dimension to a miniSD removable memory card, UICCs follow a different set of specifications with vastly different characteristics. For example, their pin connectors are not aligned along the bottom edge as with removable media cards, but instead form a contact pad integral to the smart card chip, which is embedded in a plastic frame.

UICCs also employ a broad range of tamper resistance techniques to protect the information they contain. The slot for the UICC card is normally not accessible from the exterior of the mobile device.# Understanding UICC in Mobile Devices

## Introduction
The Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) plays a crucial role in mobile devices, particularly in terms of secure communication and data storage.

## UICC Insertion and Removal
- The UICC is typically located beneath the battery compartment of a mobile device.
- Unlike memory cards, UICCs are not designed for frequent insertion and removal.
- To read data from a UICC, it is often necessary to remove it from the handset and use a Personal Computer/Smart Card (PC/SC) reader.

## Importance of UICC
- The UICC is essential for authenticating a device to a network securely.
- It contains cryptographic key information and algorithms that facilitate a challenge-response dialogue with the network.
- This process ensures that sensitive key material is not exposed, preventing unauthorized access to subscriber services.

## Cryptographic Functions
- The UICC supports stream cipher encryption to protect against eavesdropping on the air interface.
- It acts as a tamper-resistant module, safeguarding critical information.

## Memory Structure of UICC
- A UICC has both volatile and non-volatile memory, similar to a mobile device.
- It can be viewed as a trusted sub-processor that interfaces with the device and draws power from it.
- The file system in a UICC is organized as a hierarchical tree structure.

### File System Structure
- The SIM applications file system consists of three types of elements:
- **Master File (MF)**: The root of the file system.
- **Directory Files (DF)**: Subordinate directory files.
- **Elementary Files (EF)**: Files containing data.

### Example of File System
- The EFs under DFGSM and DFDCS1800 contain network-related information for different frequency bands.
- The EFs under DFTELECOM contain service-related information.

## Digital Evidence in UICC
- Various types of digital evidence can be found in elementary data files throughout the UICC's file system.
- Some information may also be stored in the mobile device's memory.

## Categories of Data in UICC
Standard elementary data files in a UICC may include:

- **Service-related Information**:
- Unique identifiers for the UICC, such as the Integrated Circuit Card Identification (ICCID) and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI).

- **Phonebook and Call Information**:
- Abbreviated Dialing Numbers (ADN) and Last Numbers Dialed (LND).

- **Messaging Information**:
- Short Message Service (SMS) text messages and Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS) multimedia messages.

- **Call Storage**:
- The USIM application supports links to incoming (EFICI) and outgoing (EFOCI) calls, each stored using two bytes.

## Conclusion
The UICC is a vital component in mobile devices, providing secure authentication, data storage, and a structured file system that can hold various types of digital evidence. Understanding its functions and structure is essential for anyone involved in mobile technology or digital forensics.# Cellular Network Characteristics

## Overview
Within the U.S., different types of digital cellular networks follow distinct incompatible sets of standards. The following sections discuss digital cellular networks, Mobile IP, and satellite phones.

## Types of Digital Cellular Networks
The two most dominant types of digital cellular networks are known as:

- **Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)**
- **Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)**

Other common cellular networks include:

- **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**
- **Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN)**

iDEN networks use a proprietary protocol designed by Motorola, while the others follow standardized open protocols. A digital version of the original analog standard for cellular telephone service, called **Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service (D-AMPS)**, also exists.

### CDMA
CDMA refers to a technology designed by Qualcomm in the U.S., which employs spread spectrum communications for the radio link. Rather than sharing a channel as many other network air interfaces do, CDMA spreads the digitized data over the entire bandwidth available, distinguishing multiple calls through a unique sequence code assigned.

Successive versions of the IS-95 standard define CDMA conventions in the U.S., which is the reason why the term CDMA is often used to refer to IS-95 compliant cellular networks. IS-95 CDMA systems are sometimes referred to as **cdmaOne**. The next evolutionary step for CDMA to 3G services was **CDMA2000**. CDMA2000 is backward compatible with its previous 2G iteration IS-95 (cdmaOne). The successor to CDMA2000 is Qualcomm’s **Long Term Evolution (LTE)**, which adds faster data transfer capabilities for mobile devices and is commonly referred to as **4G LTE**. Verizon and Sprint are common CDMA network carriers in the U.S.

### GSM
GSM is a cellular system used worldwide that was designed in Europe, primarily by Ericsson and Nokia. AT&T and T-Mobile are common GSM network carriers in the U.S. GSM uses a TDMA air interface.

#### TDMA
TDMA refers to a digital link technology whereby multiple phones share a single carrier, radio frequency channel by taking turns – using the channel exclusively for an allocated time slice, then releasing it and waiting briefly while other phones use it. A packet switching enhancement to GSM called **General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)** was standardized to improve the transmission of data.

The next generation of GSM, commonly referred to as the third generation or **3G**, is known as **Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)** and involves enhancing GSM networks with a **Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA)** air interface. 4G LTE is also available to GSM mobile devices, providing higher data transmission rates to its customers.

### Conclusion
TDMA is also used to refer specifically to the standard covered by IS-136.# Understanding TDMA and Cellular Networks

## Introduction to TDMA
The term **TDMA** (Time Division Multiple Access) can refer to a general technique or a specific type of cellular network, which can be a source of confusion. For example, although **GSM** (Global System for Mobile Communications) uses a TDMA air interface (i.e., the general technique), as does **iDEN** (Integrated Digital Enhanced Network), neither of those systems is compatible with TDMA cellular networks that follow **IS-136**.

## iDEN and Its Features
Many mobile forensic tools refer to devices operating on the iDEN network as **iDEN/TDMA phones**. Mobile devices operating over the iDEN network often utilize a **Push-To-Talk (PTT)** function, providing subscribers with the ability to communicate with one another over a cellular network in a “walkie-talkie” fashion.

### Development of iDEN
Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN) is a mobile telecommunications technology developed by **Motorola**. It provided the benefits of a two-way radio system and a cellular telephone. The iDEN project originally began as **MIRS** (Motorola Integrated Radio System) in early 1991 and was phased out in the summer of 2013 for the US markets, although coverage still exists in Mexico and Canada.

## 2G Mobile Phone Systems
**Digital AMPS (D-AMPS)**, **IS-54**, and **IS-136** are 2G mobile phone systems that were once prevalent in the United States and Canada in the 1990s. Existing networks were mostly replaced by **GSM/GPRS** or **CDMA2000** technologies.

## Mobile Device Compatibility
Mobile devices work with certain subsets of the network types mentioned, typically those associated with a service provider from whom the phone was obtained and with whom a service agreement was entered. Mobile devices may also be acquired without service from any manufacturer, vendor, or other source and subsequently have their service set up separately with a service provider or network operator.

### Unlocked Devices
Mobile devices that are permitted to be provisioned to more than one specific carrier are commonly referred to as **“unlocked”**. These devices may be used on a variety of carriers by switching **UICC** (Universal Integrated Circuit Card) for GSM mobile devices.

### Hybrid Phones
Mobile devices do exist that provide the user with both GSM and CDMA capabilities. Such devices are sometimes referred to as **hybrid phones** or **global phones**. These types of mobile devices contain two types of cellular radios for voice and data, providing the ability to operate over either the GSM or CDMA network.

## Cellular Network Structure
As the name implies, cellular networks provide coverage based on dividing up a large geographical service area into smaller areas of coverage called **cells**. Cells play an important role in the reuse of radio frequencies in the limited radio spectrum available, allowing more calls to occur than otherwise would be possible.

### Connection Management
As a mobile device moves from one cell to another, a cellular arrangement requires active connections to be monitored and effectively passed along between cells to maintain the connection. To administer the cellular network system, provide subscribed services, and accurately bill or debit subscriber accounts, data about the service contract and associated service activities is captured and maintained by the network system.

## Conclusion
Despite their differences in technology, cellular networks are organized to ensure efficient communication and service delivery to subscribers.# Mobile Communications Systems

## Overview
Mobile communications systems consist of several key components that work together to facilitate communication between mobile devices and the cellular network. These components include:

- **Node B**: Represents a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) that communicates with mobile devices.
- **Radio Network Controller (RNC)**: Manages the transceiver equipment and performs channel assignment.
- **Mobile Switching Center (MSC)**: Manages overall communications throughout the cellular network.

The RNCs and the Node B units they control are collectively referred to as a **Radio Access Network (RAN)**.

## Mobile Switching Center (MSC)
Each MSC controls a set of RNCs and is responsible for various functions, including:

- Registration
- Authentication
- Location updating
- Handovers
- Call routing

An MSC interfaces with the public switch telephone network (PSTN) via a **Gateway MSC (GMSC)**. To perform its tasks, an MSC utilizes several databases:

### Key Databases
- **Home Location Register (HLR)**: A central repository system for subscriber data and service information.
- **Visitor Location Register (VLR)**: Used for mobile devices roaming outside of their service area.

### Supporting Nodes
- **Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)**: Performs a role similar to that of MSC/VLR but supports General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) for packet-switched services.
- **Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)**: Functions similarly to a GMSC but for packet-switched services.

## Subscriber Data Management
Account information, such as subscriber data (e.g., billing address), subscribed services, and the last registered location update, is maintained at the HLR. This information is used by the MSC to route calls and messages and to generate usage records known as **Call Detail Records (CDR)**. The subscriber account data, CDRs, and related technical information obtained from the network carrier can be valuable evidence in investigations.

## Other Communications Systems
### Mobile IP
Mobile IP is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard communications protocol designed to allow mobile device users to move from one network to another while maintaining a permanent IP address.

#### Key Features
- **Seamless Connectivity**: Unlike the original IP protocol, which required restarting all active network connections when moving to a new Internet point of attachment, Mobile IP allows users to maintain their "home address" IP address, enabling continuous Internet connectivity.
- **Application**: Mobile IP is primarily used in wireless environments where users need to carry their mobile devices across different networks.# Communication Technologies

## Local Area Networks (LAN)
Multiple Local Area Network (LAN) subnets are utilized in various applications, including:

- Roaming between overlapping wireless systems (e.g., Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX))
- IP over Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB)
- Broadband Wireless Access (BWA)

## Satellite Phones
Individuals requiring communication services from remote locations (e.g., aviation, emergency services, government, military) are often equipped with satellite phones.

### Overview
Satellite phones are mobile devices that establish connectivity with satellites rather than cellular towers. Typically, they require a direct line of sight to the satellite, as obstructions (e.g., buildings, trees) can impact signal strength and call quality.

### Coverage
Depending on the service, coverage may range from a specific area to the entire Earth. For example, the Iridium satellite constellation consists of 66 Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites with spares, providing worldwide voice and data communications.

### Communication Process
Satellite phones communicate by sending radio signals to a satellite, which then transmits a signal back down to Earth where a station routes the call to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). In some cases, the satellite phone provider may transmit from one satellite to another that has a connection to an Earth station.

### Features
Much like GSM-based mobile devices, satellite phones are equipped with a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) and provide users with a variety of features, including:

- Contact list
- Text messaging
- Voicemail
- Call forwarding

## Forensic Tools

### Overview
The availability of forensic software tools for mobile devices differs significantly from that of personal computers. While personal computers may differ from mobile devices in hardware and software, their functionality has become increasingly similar.

### Operating Systems
Most mobile device operating systems are open source (e.g., Android), while feature phone operating systems are typically closed. Closed operating systems complicate the interpretation of their associated file systems and structures. Additionally, mobile devices with the same operating system may vary widely in their implementation, leading to numerous file system and structure permutations. These variations pose significant challenges for mobile forensic tool manufacturers and examiners.

### Types of Software
The types of software available for mobile device examination include:

- **Commercial and Open Source Forensic Tools**: Designed to acquire data from the internal memory of handsets and UICCs without altering their content and to calculate integrity hashes for the acquired data.
- **Non-Forensic Tools**: Intended for device management, testing, and diagnostics. These tools may allow unrestricted two-way flow of information and often omit data integrity hash functions.

Both forensic and non-forensic software tools typically use the same protocols and techniques to communicate with a device.# Mobile Device Forensics

Mobile forensics examiners typically assemble a collection of both forensic and non-forensic tools for their toolkit. The range of devices over which they operate is typically narrowed to distinct platforms, a specific operating system family, or even a single type of hardware architecture.

## Challenges in Mobile Forensics

Short product release cycles are the norm for mobile devices, requiring tool manufacturers to continually update their tools, providing forensics examiners with a forensic solution. The task is formidable, and tool manufacturers’ support for newer models may lag significantly behind the introduction of a device into the marketplace.

Models of older functioning mobile devices, though out of date, can remain in use for years after their initial release. Mobile device models introduced into one national market may also be used in areas by exchanging the UICC of one cellular carrier with that from another carrier. The current state is likely to continue, keeping the cost of examination significantly higher than if a few standard operating systems and hardware configurations prevailed.

## 3.1 Mobile Device Tool Classification System

Understanding the various types of mobile acquisition tools and the data they are capable of recovering is important for a mobile forensic examiner. The classification system used in this section provides a framework for forensic examiners to compare the extraction methods used by different tools to acquire data.

The objective of the tool classification system is to enable an examiner to easily classify and compare the extraction method of different tools. The tool classification system is displayed in Figure 6 [Bro08]. As the pyramid is traversed from the bottom, Level 1, to the top, Level 5, the methodologies involved in acquisition become more technical, invasive, time-consuming, and expensive.

### Level 1: Manual Extraction

Manual Extraction methods involve recording information brought up on a mobile device screen when employing the user interface.

### Level 2: Logical Extraction

Logical Extraction methods are used most frequently at this time and are mildly technical, requiring beginner-level training. Methods for levels 3 to 5 entail extracting and recording a copy or image of a physical store (e.g., a memory chip), compared to the logical acquisitions used at level 2, which involve capturing a copy of logical storage objects (e.g., directories and files) that reside on a logical store (e.g., a file system partition).

### Level 3: Hex Dumping/JTAG Extraction

Hex Dumping/JTAG Extraction methods entail performing a “physical acquisition” of mobile device memory in situ and require advanced training.

### Level 4: Chip-Off Methods

Chip-Off methods involve the physical removal of memory from a mobile device to extract data, requiring extensive training in electronic engineering and file system forensics.

### Level 5: Micro Read Methods

Micro Read methods involve the use of a high-powered microscope to view the physical state of gates. Level 5 methods are the most invasive, sophisticated, technical, expensive, and time-consuming of all the methodologies.# Data Extraction Methods in Forensics

There are pros and cons to performing extraction types at each layer. For example, hex dumping allows deleted objects and any data remnants present to be examined (e.g., in unallocated memory or file system space), which otherwise would be inaccessible through the use of logical acquisition methods. However, the extracted device images require parsing, decryption, and decoding.

Logical acquisition methods, though more limited than Hex Dumping/JTAG methods, have the advantage in that the system data structures are at a higher level of abstraction and are normally easier for a tool to extract and render. These differences are due to the underlying distinction between memory as seen by a process via the operating system facilities (i.e., a logical view), versus memory as seen in raw form by the processor or another hardware component (i.e., a physical view).

Based upon a wide variety of circumstances (e.g., type of data needed, time available, urgency, available tools, etc.), an examiner may select a specific level to begin their examination. It is important to note that once a level is used, alternate levels may not be possible. For example, after performing chip-off (level 4), lower level tools may not be physically possible.

Forensic examiners should be aware of such issues and perform the appropriate level of extraction commensurate with their training and experience. With each methodology, data may be permanently destroyed or modified if a given tool or procedure is not properly utilized. The risk of alteration and destruction increases in tandem with the levels. Thus, proper training and mentoring is critical in obtaining the highest success rate for data extraction and analysis of the data contained within mobile devices.

## Levels of Data Extraction

The following discussion provides a more detailed description of each level and the methods used for data extraction.

### Manual Extraction

A manual extraction method involves viewing the data content stored on a mobile device. The content displayed on the LCD screen requires the manual manipulation of the buttons, keyboard, or touchscreen to view the contents of the mobile device. Information discovered may be recorded using an external digital camera.

At this level, it is impossible to recover deleted information. Some tools have been developed to provide the forensic examiner with the ability to document and categorize the information recorded more quickly. Nevertheless, if there is a large amount of data to be captured, a manual extraction can be very time-consuming, and the data on the device may be inadvertently modified, deleted, or overwritten as a result of the examination.

Manual extractions become increasingly difficult and perhaps unachievable when encountering a broken/missing LCD screen or a damaged/missing keyboard interface. Additional challenges occur when the device is configured to display a language unknown to the investigator; this may cause difficulty in successful menu navigation.

### Logical Extraction

Connectivity between a mobile device and the forensics workstation is achieved with a connection using either a wired (e.g., USB or RS-232) or wireless method.

*Note: The text appears to be cut off here. Further details on logical extraction methods may be required for a complete understanding.*# Mobile Device Forensics

## Connectivity Methods

The examiner should be aware of the issues associated with selecting a specific connectivity method, as different connection types and associated protocols may result in data being modified (e.g., unread SMS) or different amounts or types of data being extracted.

### Logical Extraction Tools

Logical extraction tools begin by sending a series of commands over the established interface from the computer to the mobile device. The mobile device responds based on the command request. The response (mobile device data) is sent back to the workstation and presented to the forensics examiner for reporting purposes.

## Extraction Methods

### Hex Dumping and JTAG

Hex Dumping and Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) extraction methods afford the forensic examiner more direct access to the raw information stored in flash memory. One challenge with these extraction methods is the ability of a given tool to parse and decode the captured data. Providing the forensic examiner with a logical view of the file system and reporting on other data remnants outside the file system that may be present are challenging. For example, all data contained within a given flash memory chip may not be acquired, as many tools, such as flasher boxes, may only be able to extract specific sections of memory.

Methods used at this level require connectivity (e.g., cable or WiFi) between the mobile device and the forensic workstation.

#### Hex Dumping

This technique is the more commonly used method by tools at this level. It involves uploading a modified boot loader (or other software) into a protected area of memory (e.g., RAM) on the device. This upload process is accomplished by connecting the mobile device’s data port to a flasher box, which is in turn connected to the forensic workstation. A series of commands is sent from the flasher box to the mobile device to place it in a diagnostic mode. Once in diagnostic mode, the flasher box captures all (or sections) of flash memory and sends it to the forensic workstation over the same communications link used for the upload. Some flasher boxes work this way, or they may use a proprietary interface for memory extractions. Rare cases exist where extractions can be accomplished using WiFi (i.e., early Jonathan Zdziarski (JZ) Methods).

#### JTAG

Many manufacturers support the JTAG standard, which defines a common test interface for processor, memory, and other semiconductor chips. Forensic examiners can communicate with a JTAG-compliant component by utilizing special purpose standalone programmer devices to probe defined test points. The JTAG testing unit can be used to request memory addresses from the JTAG-compliant component and accept the response for storage and rendition. JTAG gives specialists another avenue for imaging devices that are locked or devices that may have minor damage and cannot be properly interfaced otherwise. This method involves attaching a cable (or wiring harness) from a workstation to the mobile device’s JTAG interface and accessing memory via the device’s microprocessor to produce an image. JTAG extractions differ mainly from Hex Dumping in that it is invasive, as access to the connections frequently requires that the examiner dismantle some (or most) of a mobile device to obtain access to establish the wiring.# Flasher Boxes in Mobile Device Forensics

Flasher boxes are small devices originally designed with the intent to service or upgrade mobile devices. Physical acquisitions frequently require the use of a flasher box to facilitate the extraction of data from a mobile device. The flasher box aids the examiner by communicating with the mobile device using diagnostic protocols to communicate with the memory chip. This communication may utilize the mobile device’s operating system or may bypass it altogether and communicate directly to the chip [Jon10].

Flasher boxes are often accompanied by software to facilitate the data extraction process, working in conjunction with the hardware. Many flasher box software packages provide the added functionality of recovering passwords from mobile device memory as well in some configurations. Although acquisition methods differ between flasher boxes, a general process is used [Bre07].

## Limitations of Flasher Boxes

The use of flasher boxes comes with several limitations:

- **Rebooting Requirement**: Rebooting of the mobile device is frequently required to begin the extraction process; this may cause authentication mechanisms to activate, preventing further analysis.
- **Encrypted Data**: Many flasher boxes recover the data in an encrypted format, requiring the examiner to either use the software provided by the flasher box manufacturer to decrypt the data or may require reverse engineering the data’s encryption scheme by the analyst.
- **Memory Range Limitations**: Many phone models do not provide the acquisition of the entire memory range within a given mobile device. Only certain ranges may be available for certain mobile devices.
- **Confusing Interface**: The flasher box service software often has many buttons that are labeled with nearly identical names. This confusion may easily lead even an experienced examiner to press the wrong button, erasing the contents of the mobile device instead of dumping the memory.
- **Lack of Documentation**: Lack of documentation on the use of the flasher box tools is common. Extraction methods are frequently shared on forums supported by the vendor and moderated by more seasoned users. Caution should be taken when advice is provided, as not all the information provided is correct.
- **Forensic Use**: Nearly all flasher boxes were not designed with forensic use as their intended purpose. Examiners must be experienced in the use of flasher boxes and should understand the proper use and function of these tools.

Despite all of these limitations, the use of a flasher box is a viable option for many forensics cases. Proper training, experience, and understanding of how the tools work are the keys to success.

## Technical Expertise Required

A wide range of technical expertise and proper training is required for extracting and analyzing binary images with these methods, including:

- Locating and connecting to JTAG ports
- Creating customized boot loaders
- Recreating file systems

## Chip-Off Method

### Overview

Chip-Off methods refer to the acquisition of data directly from a mobile device’s flash memory. This extraction requires the physical removal of flash memory. Chip-Off provides examiners with the ability to create a binary image of the removed chip.

### Process

In order to provide the examiner with data in a contiguous binary format file, the wear-leveling algorithm must be reverse engineered. Once complete, the binary image may then be analyzed. This type of acquisition is most closely related to physically imaging a hard disk drive as in traditional digital forensics.

### Training Requirements

Extensive training is required in order to successfully perform extractions at this level.# Chip-Off Extractions and Forensic Tools

Chip-Off extractions are challenging due to a wide variety of chip types, a myriad of raw data formats, and the risk of causing physical damage to the chip during the extraction process. Due to the complexities related to Chip-Off, JTAG extraction is more common.

## Micro Read

A Micro Read involves recording the physical observation of the gates on a NAND or NOR chip with the use of an electron microscope. Due to the extreme technicalities involved when performing a Micro Read, this level of acquisition would only be attempted for high-profile cases equivalent to a national security crisis after all other acquisition techniques have been exhausted. Successful acquisition at this level would require a team of experts, proper equipment, time, and in-depth knowledge of proprietary information. There are no known U.S. Law Enforcement agencies performing acquisitions at this level. Currently, there are no commercially available Micro Read tools.

## Forensic Tools Classification

Table 3 provides a classification of some tools currently used in mobile device investigations and identifies the facilities they provide: acquisition, examination, or reporting. Additional tools do exist, but only those familiar to the authors are discussed. For a more complete and up-to-date list of forensic tools, refer to the NIST Tool Taxonomy. The tools listed in Table 3 are grouped by level starting with Level 1 (Manual Extraction) through Level 4 (Chip-Off).

### Tool Descriptions

The following describes each of the headings contained within Table 3:

- **Tool** – Tool name
- **†** Denotes a tool that supports the logical acquisition of a UICC
- **‡** Denotes a tool that supports the logical acquisition of a UICC and the creation of a Cellular Network Isolation Card (CNIC)
- **Acquisition Level** – Levels at which the tool performs data extractions:
- 1 - Manual extraction
- 2 - Logical extraction
- 3 - Physical extraction
- 4 - Chip-off
- 5 - Micro Read
- **Network Type** – Acquisition of devices operating over specified networks
- **Forensic Tool** – Is the tool specifically designed for forensic acquisition
- **Examination/Analysis** – Provides the examiner with the ability to perform examination or analysis of acquired data
- **Reporting** – Provides the examiner with the ability to generate reports
- **3rd Party Tool Image Analysis (3PIA)** – Supports importing of raw data produced from another manufacturer’s tool
- **Chinese Chipset Support (CCS)** – Mobile devices containing Chinese chipsets are increasing as they continue to flood the international market. Some mobile forensic tools provide either a logical and/or physical extraction solution.
- **Cables/Hardware Available (C/HW)** – Cables are provided

## UICC Tools

A few mobile forensics tools deal exclusively with UICCs. These tools perform a direct read of a UICC’s contents via a Personal Computer/Smart Card (PC/SC) reader, as opposed to an indirect read via the mobile device. The richness and scope of data acquired varies with the capabilities and features of the tool. The majority of UICC exclusive tools acquire the data effectively.# Mobile Forensics Overview

## Data Types Extracted
The following data can be extracted from mobile devices:
- International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)
- Integrated Circuit Card ID (ICCID)
- Abbreviated Dialing Numbers (ADN)
- Last Numbers Dialed (LND)
- SMS messages
- Location Information (LOCI) [Aye12]

Most tools provide additional information such as:
- Deleted SMS messages
- Properly rendered foreign language SMS and EMS messages
- Translations of country and network operator codes into meaningful names
- Other facilities such as PIN administration

## CSIM Partitions
CSIM partitions on UICCs are increasingly used with LTE-enabled mobile devices. Currently, few tools support the extraction of CSIM partition data, as most only support extraction of GSM and USIM partitions. However, CSIM data may prove to be of increasing forensic importance as this technology evolves.

## Obstructed Devices
The following sections discuss techniques for bypassing an obstructed device, i.e., a mobile device that requires successful authentication using a password or some other means to obtain access to the device. There are several methods to recover data from obstructed devices, which fall into three categories:
1. Software-based
2. Hardware-based
3. Investigative

Common obstructed devices include:
- Devices with missing identity modules
- PIN-enabled UICCs
- Enabled mobile device locks

Password-locked and encrypted memory cards provide users with additional means to protect data, making recovery more complex. Content encryption capabilities are often standard features in many mobile devices or may be available through add-on applications.

As mobile forensics tools have evolved, they have begun to provide automated functions that allow examiners to bypass many security mechanisms as part of their products. For instance, some tools offer automated functions to recover passwords from locked mobile devices.

### Considerations for Method Development
In developing a method, the following sections provide actions that should be considered for determining possible approaches.

#### Software and Hardware Based Methods
Software-based methods used to break or bypass authentication mechanisms have begun to appear. For example, some tools provide automated functions to recover passwords from locked mobile devices. This functionality varies greatly between mobile forensic tools and the device models that are supported.

Hardware-based methods involve a combination of software and hardware to break or bypass authentication mechanisms and gain access to the device. For example, the value of a mobile device lock can be readily recovered from a memory dump of certain devices, allowing for a follow-on logical acquisition. JTAG and flasher boxes are often used in this manner.# Circumventing Authentication Mechanisms

Device-specific attacks, such as cold boot attacks, exist to bypass authentication mechanisms. Cold boot attacks have the ability to recover passwords from locked Android-based devices by cooling the device 10 degrees below Celsius, followed by disconnecting and reconnecting the battery in 500ms intervals [Mül12]. Few general-purpose hardware-based methods apply to a general class of mobile devices. Most of the techniques are tailored for a specific model within a class.

## 3.3.2 Investigative Methods

Investigative methods are procedures the investigative team can apply, which require no forensic software or hardware tools. The most obvious methods are the following:

- **Ask the owner**: If a device is protected with a password, PIN, or other authentication mechanism involving knowledge-based authentication, the owner may be queried for this information during an interview.

- **Review seized material**: Passwords or PINs may be written down on a slip of paper and kept with or near the phone, at a desktop computer used to synchronize with the mobile device, or with the owner, such as in a wallet, and may be recovered through visual inspection. Packaging material for a UICC or a mobile device may disclose a PIN Unlocking Key (PUK) that may be used to reset the value of the PIN. Device-specific vulnerabilities may also be exploited, such as Smudge attacks. Smudge attacks involve careful analysis of the surface of a touchscreen device to determine the most recent gesture lock used [Avi10].

- **Ask the service provider**: If a GSM mobile device is protected with a PIN-enabled UICC, the identifier (i.e., the ICCID) may be obtained from it and used to request the PUK from the service provider and reset the PIN. Some service providers offer the ability to retrieve the PUK online by entering the telephone number of the mobile device and specific subscriber information into public web pages set up for this purpose. Additionally, information may be obtained by contacting the device manufacturer (e.g., Apple).

Mobile device users may choose weak passwords to secure their device, such as: 1-1-1-1, 0-0-0-0, or 1-2-3-4. Some of these numeric combinations are device default passcodes provided by the manufacturer. It is not recommended to attempt to unlock a device using these combinations due to several risk factors. They may include permanent wiping of mobile device memory, enabling additional security mechanisms (e.g., PIN/PUK), or initializing destructive applications. Mobile devices generally have a defined number of attempts before enabling further security precautions. Before making any attempts at unlocking a mobile device, it is recommended to consider the number of attempts left. There may be instances where an examiner may choose to accept these risks in cases where this is the only option for data extraction.

## 3.4 Forensic Tool Capabilities

Forensic software tools strive to handle conventional investigative needs by...# Forensic Tool Validation and Data Integrity

## Overview
Addressing a wide range of applicable devices, forensic tools are essential for data recovery. More difficult situations, such as the recovery of deleted data from the memory of a device, may require more specialized tools, expertise, and disassembly of the device.

## Support and Features
The range of support provided, including mobile device cables and drivers, product documentation, PC/SC readers, and the frequency of updates, may vary significantly among products. The features offered, such as searching, bookmarking, and reporting capabilities, may also vary considerably.

## Discrepancies in Data Recovery
Discrepancies in recovering and reporting the data residing on a device have been noted in previous testing of tools. These discrepancies include:
- Inability to recover resident data
- Inconsistencies between the data displayed on the workstation and that generated in output reports
- Truncated data in reported or displayed output
- Errors in the decoding and translation of recovered data
- Inability to recover all relevant data

On occasion, updates or new versions of a tool were found to be less capable in some aspects than a previous version.

## Tool Validation
Tools should be validated to ensure their acceptability and reapplied when updates or new versions of the tool become available. These results play a factor in deciding the appropriateness of the tool, how to compensate for any noted shortcomings, and whether to consider using a different version or update of the tool.

### Validation Process
Validating a tool entails:
1. Defining and identifying a comprehensive set of test data
2. Following acquisition procedures to recover the test data
3. Assessing the results

Present-day tools seldom provide the means to obtain detailed logs of data extraction and other transactions that would aid in validation. An examiner can compare the output of several tools to verify the consistency of results. While tool validation is time-consuming, it is a necessary practice to follow.

## Training for Forensic Specialists
As a quality measure, forensic specialists should also receive adequate up-to-date training in the tools and procedures they employ.

## Data Integrity
An important characteristic of a forensic tool is its ability to maintain the integrity of the original data source being acquired and that of the extracted data.

### Integrity Maintenance
- **Original Data Source**: This is done by blocking or otherwise eliminating write requests to the device containing the data.
- **Extracted Data**: This is done by computing a cryptographic hash over the contents of the evidence files created and recurrently verifying that this value remains unchanged throughout the lifetime of those files.

Preserving integrity not only maintains credibility from a legal perspective but also allows any subsequent investigation to use the same baseline for replicating the analysis.

## Forensic Hash Validation
A forensic hash is used to maintain the integrity of an acquisition by computing a cryptographically strong, non-reversible value over the acquired data. After acquisition, any changes made to the data may be detected since a new hash will differ from the original.# Digital Evidence Preservation in Mobile Forensics

## 1. Introduction
Value computed over the data will be inconsistent with the old value. For non-forensic tools, hash values should be created using a tool such as `sha1sum` and retained for integrity verification. Even tools labeled as forensic tools may not compute a cryptographic hash, and in these cases, an integrity hash should be computed separately.

Note that mobile devices are constantly active and update information (e.g., the device clock) continuously. Therefore, back-to-back acquisitions of a device will be slightly different and produce different hash values when computed over all the data. However, hash values computed over selected data items, such as individual files and directories, generally remain consistent. Hash inconsistencies may occur requiring the examiner to perform an element-by-element verification ensuring data integrity. Hash validation across multiple tools is challenging due to proprietary reporting formats.

## 2. Preservation
Sections 4 through 7 describe the forensics process as it applies to mobile devices. Evidence preservation is the process of securely maintaining custody of property without altering or changing the contents of data that reside on devices and removable media. It is the first step in digital evidence recovery.

The chapter begins with a generic introduction to preservation and then provides more specific guidance about how to deal with mobile devices. Preservation involves the search, recognition, documentation, and collection of electronic-based evidence. In order to use evidence successfully, whether in a court of law or a less formal proceeding, it must be preserved. Failure to preserve evidence in its original state could jeopardize an entire investigation, potentially losing valuable case-related information.

The remaining sections of this chapter provide supplemental information related to mobile devices, following the paradigm of:
- Securing and Evaluating the Scene
- Documenting the Scene
- Isolation
- Packaging
- Transporting and Storing Evidence
- Triage/On-Site Processing

### 2.1 Securing and Evaluating the Scene
Incorrect procedures or improper handling of a mobile device during seizure may cause loss of digital data. Moreover, traditional forensic measures, such as fingerprints or DNA testing, may need to be applied to establish a link between a mobile device and its owner or user. If the device is not handled properly, physical evidence may be contaminated and rendered useless.

Alertness to mobile device characteristics and issues (e.g., memory volatility) and familiarity with tangential equipment (e.g., media, cables, and power adapters) are essential. For mobile devices, sources of evidence include the device, UICC, and associated media. Associated peripherals, cables, power adapters, and other accessories are also of interest. All areas of the scene should be searched thoroughly ensuring related evidence is not overlooked. Equipment associated with the mobile device, such as removable media, UICCs, or other accessories, should also be considered.# Mobile Device Forensics

## Importance of Personal Computers
Personal computers may prove more valuable than the mobile device itself. Removable media varies in size and can be easily hidden and difficult to find. Most often, removable memory cards are identifiable by their distinctive shape and the presence of electrical contacts located on their bodies that are used to establish an interface with the device. Personal computers may be particularly useful in later accessing a locked mobile device, if the personal computer has established a trusted relationship with it.

For example, Apple incorporates a pairing process whereby an existing pairing record file can be used by some tools [Zdz12] to access the mobile device while it is still locked.

## Interviewing the Owner or User
When interviewing the owner or user of a mobile device, consider requesting any security codes, passwords, or gestures needed to gain access to its contents. For example, GSM devices may have authentication codes set for the internal memory and/or the UICC.

## Securing the Mobile Device
While securing a mobile device, caution should be taken when an individual is allowed to handle the mobile device. Many mobile devices have master reset codes that clear the contents of the device to original factory conditions. Master resets may be performed remotely requiring proper precautions such as network isolation to ensure that evidence is not modified or destroyed.

## Compromised State of Mobile Devices
Mobile devices may be found in a compromised state that may complicate seizure, such as immersion in a liquid. In these situations, forensic examiners should adhere to agency-specific procedures. One method involves removal of the battery preventing electrical shorting, while the remainder of the mobile device is sealed in an appropriate container filled with the same liquid for transport to the lab, provided the liquid is not caustic.

Some compromised states, such as blood contamination or use with explosives (i.e., as a bomb component) can pose a danger to the technician collecting evidence. In such situations, a specialist should be consulted for specific instructions or assistance.

## Damaged State of Mobile Devices
Mobile devices and associated media may be found in a damaged state, caused by accidental or deliberate action. Devices or media with visible external damage do not necessarily prevent the extraction of data. Damaged equipment should be taken back to the lab for closer inspection.

Repairing damaged components on a mobile device and restoring the device to working order for examination and analysis may be possible. Undamaged memory components may also be removed from a damaged device and their contents recovered independently. This method should be used with caution, as it is not possible with all devices.

## Documenting the Scene
Evidence must be accurately identified and accounted for. Non-electronic materials such as invoices, manuals, and packaging material may provide useful information about the capabilities of the device, the network used, account information, and unlocking procedures.# Mobile Device Forensics

## Documentation of the Crime Scene

Photographing the crime scene in conjunction with documenting a report on the state of each digital device and all computers encountered may be helpful in the investigation, if questions arise later about the environment. A record of all visible data should be created.

### Photographing Digital Devices

All digital devices, including mobile devices, which may store data, should be photographed along with all peripherals, cables, power connectors, removable media, and connections. Avoid touching or contaminating the mobile device when photographing it and the environment where found. If the device’s display is in a viewable state, the screen’s contents should be photographed and, if necessary, recorded manually, capturing the time, service status, battery level, and other displayed icons.

## Isolation

Many mobile devices offer the user the ability to perform either a remote lock or remote wipe by simply sending a command (e.g., text message) to the mobile device. Additional reasons for disabling network connectivity include incoming data (e.g., calls or text messages) that may modify the current state of the data stored on the mobile device. Outgoing data may also be undesirable as the current GPS location may be delivered to an advisory providing the geographic location of the forensic examiner.

### Precautions for Forensic Examiners

Therefore, forensic examiners need to be aware and take precautions when securing mobile devices to mitigate the chance of data modification. The Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence’s (SWGDE) “Best Practices for Mobile Phone Forensics” document covers best practices for the proper isolation of mobile devices [SWG13]. Some key implications for proper collection are summarized below.

### Importance of Isolation

Isolating the mobile device from other devices used for data synchronization is important to keep new data from contaminating existing data. If the device is found in a cradle or connected with a personal computer, pulling the plug from the back of the personal computer eliminates data transfer or synchronization overwrites.

It is recommended that a capture of the personal computer’s memory be extracted before “pulling the plug” as memory acquired generally proves to be of significant forensic value. Caution should be used, as removing a device that is performing a software update or backup has the potential to corrupt the mobile device’s file system.

### Memory Forensics Tools

The use of memory forensics tools for the capture of a personal computer’s memory should be done by a qualified digital forensics professional. The mobile device should be seized along with associated hardware. Media cards, UICCs, and other hardware residing in the mobile device should not be removed.

Also, seizing the computer that was connected to the mobile device provides the ability to acquire synchronized data from the hard disk that might not be obtained from the device. Any associated hardware such as media cards, UICCs, power connectors, etc., should also be documented and preserved.# Mobile Device Forensics

## Overview
When seizing mobile devices, it is crucial to include all related materials such as adapters, device sleeves, peripherals, product manuals, packaging, and software.

## Importance of Isolation
Isolating a mobile device from all radio networks (e.g., WiFi, Cellular, and Bluetooth) is essential to prevent new traffic, such as SMS messages, from overwriting existing data. This is important not only to preserve potential evidence but also to address the question of whether data received on the mobile device after seizure falls within the scope of the original authority granted.

### Risks of Vulnerabilities
Mobile devices may have vulnerabilities that can be exploited, particularly related to:
- Software vulnerabilities from web browsers and operating systems
- SMS and MMS
- Third-party applications
- WiFi networks

The exploitation of such vulnerabilities may lead to the modification of data during forensic examination.

## Methods for Isolation
There are three basic methods for isolating a mobile device from radio communication:

### 1. Airplane Mode
- **Description**: Enabling "Airplane Mode" requires interaction with the mobile device using the keypad.
- **Risks**: This poses some risk, especially if the technician is not familiar with the device. Documentation of actions taken (e.g., on paper or video) is recommended.
- **Note**: Airplane mode does not prevent the system from using other services such as GPS in all cases.

### 2. Turning Off the Device
- **Description**: Turning off the mobile device may activate authentication codes (e.g., UICC PIN and/or handset security codes).
- **Risks**: This complicates acquisition and delays examination.

### 3. Shielded Container
- **Description**: Keeping the mobile device on but radio isolated can shorten battery life due to increased power consumption.
- **Risks**: Devices unable to connect to a network may raise their signal strength to maximum. After some time, failure to connect may cause certain mobile devices to reset or clear network data that would otherwise be useful. Faraday containers may attenuate the radio signal but may not eliminate it completely, allowing the possibility of communications being established with a cell tower if in the immediate vicinity.

## Power Conservation Issues
To conserve power, some mobile devices are configured to enter energy savings mode and shut off the display after a short period of inactivity. Additionally, some devices may shut themselves off if the battery level drops below a certain threshold to protect data stored in volatile memory, which defeats the purpose of keeping the device turned on.

Keeping such a device in an active state can be troublesome, requiring periodic interaction with the device. If additional power cannot be supplied to a device and it is turned off to conserve power, it may lead to data loss.# Mobile Device Security Considerations

## Memory Preservation and Protection Mechanisms
When a mobile device is turned on again, there is a risk of encountering a protection mechanism. Authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, typically cannot be deactivated without first satisfying the mechanism (e.g., supplying the correct password).

## Time Settings
The time maintained on the mobile device may be set independently of that from the network. Always record the date and time shown on the handset, if it is turned on, and compare them with a reference clock, noting any inconsistencies. If the screen is dim due to power management, it may be necessary to press an “insignificant” key, such as the volume key, to light the screen.

## Security Mechanisms and Modifications
Security mechanisms, key remapping, and malicious programs may be present on mobile devices. Certain types of modifications to the software applications and operating system of the device might affect the way it is handled. The following is a list of examples of some classes of modifications to consider:

### Security Enhancements
Organizations and individuals may enhance their handheld devices with add-on security mechanisms. A variety of login, biometric, and other authentication mechanisms are available for mobile devices as replacements or supplements to password mechanisms. Improper interaction with a mechanism could cause the device to lock down and even destroy its contents. This is particularly a concern with mechanisms that use security tokens whose presence is constantly monitored and whose disconnection from a card slot or other device interface is immediately acted upon.

### Malicious Programs
A mobile device may contain a virus or other malicious software. Such malware may attempt to spread to other devices over wired or wireless interfaces, including cross-platform jumps to completely different platforms. Common utilities or functions may also be intentionally replaced with versions of software designed to alter or damage data present on a mobile device. Such programs could conditionally be activated or suppressed based on conditions such as input parameters or hardware key interrupts. Watchdog applications could also be written to listen for specific events (e.g., key chords or over-the-air messages) and carry out actions such as deleting the contents of the device.

### Key Remapping
Hardware keys may be remapped to perform a different function than the default. A key press or combination of key presses intended for one purpose could launch an arbitrary program.

### Geo Fencing
Some devices may be configured to automatically wipe all data when the GPS in the device determines that it has left (or entered) a specific predetermined geographic area. This method may also employ WiFi towers for location determination as well.

### Explosives and Booby Traps
Mobile devices may be rigged to detonate bombs remotely or explode themselves if a specific action is carried out on the device (e.g., receiving an incoming call, text message, or pressing a specific key chord sequence, etc.).# Mobile Device Isolation Techniques

## Alarms
Many mobile devices have an audible alarm feature. The alarm function is capable of powering on an inactive device, establishing network connectivity, and the potential for a remote wipe.

The following sections discuss the use and characteristics of radio isolation containers and cellular network isolation techniques.

## 4.3.1 Radio Isolation Containers
A field test on the effectiveness of various mobile phone shielding devices (i.e., a tool designed to act as a Faraday cage) was conducted at Purdue University. There are many shielding devices that claim to radio isolate a mobile device; unfortunately, these tools do not always successfully prevent network communication [Kat10].

The tests conducted at Purdue used multiple shielding devices with mobile devices operating over three of the largest U.S. providers while varying the distance from the provider’s towers. The majority of the test cases proved that the shielding devices tested did not prevent network communication in all cases, and SMS messages most often penetrated the device while shielded, followed by voice calls and MMS messages.

Three reasons why the shielding devices may fail are due to:
- The materials not providing enough attenuation
- Leaks or seams in the shield
- The conductive shield acting as an antenna

While many manufacturers claim the effectiveness of their shielding device, it is important to understand that the effectiveness of the isolation device is based upon attenuating signal between specific decibels. Therefore, the effectiveness of the isolation containers tested was not 100% effective in most cases, and devices used to preserve evidence require verification.

Some of the products mentioned in the above paper have since been improved to provide a more effective radio isolation solution. Examiners should test their own products to validate that they are working properly before use.

## 4.3.2 Cellular Network Isolation Techniques
A number of techniques exist for isolating a mobile device from cell tower communications [INT06]. The device should be fully charged prior to examination, and consideration should be given to having a fixed or portable power source attached. The following provides an overview of various cellular network isolation techniques.

- **Cellular Network Isolation Card (CNIC)**: A CNIC mimics the identity of the original UICC and prevents network access to/from the handset. Such cards prevent the handset from erasing call log data due to a foreign SIM being inserted. This technique permits acquisition without concern of wireless interference.

- **Shielded Containers**: A portable shielded container may allow examinations to be conducted safely once the phone is situated inside. Cables connected to the container must be fully isolated to prevent network communications from occurring. This method is one of the most frequently used.

- **Shielded Work Areas**: Shielding an entire work area can be an expensive but effective way to conduct examinations safely in a fixed location. A “Faraday”...# Cellular Network Isolation Techniques

## Introduction
The following document discusses various techniques and tools used for cellular network isolation, particularly in the context of mobile device forensics.

## Tent Usage
- **Portability**: A tent is a cheaper alternative that allows for portability.
- **Feeding Cables**: Feeding cables into the tent can be problematic. Without proper isolation, cables can behave as antennas, defeating the purpose of the tent.
- **Workspace Restrictions**: The workspace within the tent may also be very restrictive.

## Disabling Network Service
- **Service Provider Contact**: The cellular carrier providing service to the mobile device might be able to disable the service.
- **Required Information**: The service provider or network operator must be contacted with details identifying the service to be disabled, such as:
- Equipment identifier
- Subscriber identifier
- Phone number
- **Challenges**: This information is not always readily available, and the coordination and confirmation process may impose delays.

## Jamming/Spoofing Devices
- **Signal Emission**: These devices emit a signal stronger than a cell phone’s or interfere with the signal, rendering communication useless.
- **Spoofing Technique**: Another technique involves tricking the phone into thinking a “no service” signal is coming from the nearest cell tower.
- **Legal Considerations**: Such devices may affect communications in the surrounding public airspace beyond the examination area, and unlicensed use may be illegal in some jurisdictions. [NIJ05]

## Cellular Network Isolation Cards (CNIC)
- **Definition**: Some tools can create a Cellular Network Isolation Card (CNIC) [SWG13].
- **Functionality**: CNICs provide cellular network isolation, preventing network communication that may modify data contained on a mobile device (e.g., remote wiping, incoming text messages).
- **Connectivity**: A CNIC lacks specific data elements required to establish connectivity between the mobile device and its associated network, such as a cipher key, thus preventing access to a cellular network.

### Creation of CNIC
- **Source UICC**: A CNIC may be created by the examiner using the original UICC as a source or by entering the data manually.
- **Manual Entry**: Manual entry is helpful if the UICC associated with a specific mobile device is not present.
- **Tool Specificity**: CNICs are tool specific and are not interchangeable between the tools of various manufacturers.
- **Effectiveness**: CNICs vary in their effectiveness and support based on specific mobile devices. For example, CNICs may not be used for data extraction from TDMA devices.

### Common Mistakes
- **Foreign UICC Insertion**: Occasionally, a UICC may not be present with a mobile device or may be intentionally damaged, but is necessary for data acquisition.
- **Linkage Issues**: One of the most common mistakes forensic examiners make is inserting a foreign UICC into the mobile device to facilitate data acquisition. Some mobile devices are linked to a specific UICC, and booting a mobile device with a foreign UICC can cause data elements such as:
- Call logs (missed, incoming, and outgoing calls)
- SMS messages present within the internal memory of the device.# Mobile Device Forensics

## Substitute UICC (CNIC)

A better approach is to create a substitute UICC (i.e., CNIC) to use with the mobile device that mimics key characteristics of the original UICC, tricking the device to accept it as the original. Most mobile forensic tools provide the forensic examiner with the ability to create a CNIC.

### Situations for Substituting UICCs

Substituting UICCs, sometimes referred to as CNICs, may be useful in a number of situations:

- If a mobile device’s UICC is missing or damaged and is required for acquisition with a forensic tool, creation of a CNIC permits data to be recovered from the handset.
- If the UICC for a device is present, but requires a PUK code, a substitute UICC can be created providing acquisition to proceed without having to contact the service provider for the PUK.
- If cellular network isolation is required (e.g., avoiding incoming calls or text messages), a CNIC provides a method permitting acquisition of data from the handset while simultaneously denying cellular network authentication.
- If a forensic tool accesses the UICC during the acquisition process, using a CNIC in the handset eliminates the possibility of the original being modified (e.g., status flag of SMS messages modified from unread to read).

### Key Identifiers

The values by which the mobile device correlates to the previously inserted UICC are the ICCID and the IMSI. Often only one of these values is used. Both identifiers are unique and used to authenticate the user to the network. While the minimum data needed to create a UICC may be simply one of these two values, some mobile devices may require additional data to be populated on the CNIC to be properly recognized. The possibility exists that data, other than user data, may change on the handset as the result of inserting a CNIC.

## Packaging, Transporting, and Storing Evidence

Once the mobile device is ready to be seized, the forensic specialist should seal the device in an appropriate container and label it appropriately according to agency specifications. Due to the volatile nature of some mobile devices, they should immediately be checked into a forensic laboratory for processing, and the power requirements should be discussed with the evidence custodian. Battery-powered devices held in storage for more than a day risk power depletion and data loss unless a process is in place to avoid this outcome.

Storage facilities that hold evidence should provide a cool, dry environment appropriate for valuable electronic equipment. All evidence should be in sealed containers in a secure area with controlled access.

## On-Site Triage Processing

Currently, many organizations are challenged with large backlogs of digital forensics casework. An on-site triage solution is being employed more and more worldwide to accommodate for this exponential growth in digital forensic caseload. Triaging involves...# Data Extraction and On-Site Triage

## Overview
Performing a data extraction (i.e., Manual or Logical) on-scene is followed immediately by a preliminary analysis of the data extracted. Logical extraction tools provide additional capabilities to use keywords and specific known hashes, alerting the on-scene examiner immediately to potential issues that need to be addressed.

## Importance of On-Site Triage
Where possible, devices supporting encryption, such as Android and iOS devices, should be triage processed at the scene if they are found in an unlocked state. This is crucial as the data may no longer be available to an investigator once the device’s screen is locked or if the battery exhausts. Deploying the use of field forensics tools to either acquire the device or establish a trusted relationship with the device will ensure that the data can be accessed at a later time, after the device has locked.

### Key Identifications
On-Site Triage is especially useful in identifying:
- Media most likely to contain evidence
- Investigations that require a more detailed and technical examination
- Investigations that could be subject to limited examination by qualified practitioners
- Material requiring urgent investigation
- Examinations suitable for outsourcing
- The extent of the assistance the unit will need to provide to an investigation

## Benefits of On-Site Triage Processing
On-Site Triage processing offers several benefits, including:
- **Reduced laboratory workload**: Digital forensic laboratory submissions may be reduced when nothing of interest is found on-scene and the level of suspicion is low.
- **Exigency**: On-scene examiners have actionable results immediately.
- **Better leveraging of existing resources**: Intelligence resources are enhanced through the use of keywords/hash lists.
- **Reduced training costs**: Triage tools are typically designed to require less training than deeper analysis tools and techniques.
- **Reduced unit cost**: Triage tools are frequently more affordable than deeper analysis capable counterparts.
- **Live collection opportunity**: Devices are often presented in an unlocked state, affording the on-site examiner the potential to extract more data before the locking mechanism is activated.

## Scoring Method for Prioritization
Organizations may wish to develop some sort of “scoring” method to aid with the prioritization of on-site triage examinations. This should be developed on a per-organization basis and should be reviewed and updated to accommodate changes.

## Generic On-Site Decision Tree
Figure 7 illustrates an example of an on-site decision tree that may be used as a general guideline for organizations and agencies. This provides a starting point intended for customization, allowing alignment with existing policies and procedures. The following list describes some of the actions and decision points contained within the tree:
- **Unlocked/Undamaged**: Is the device in an unlocked state and functional, permitting a manual or logical data extraction?
- **Urgent**: Do circumstances exist such that data extraction is required on site?
- **Lab less than 2 hours away**: Can the mobile device be transported to a forensics laboratory in less than 2 hours?# Mobile Device Forensic Examination

## Tool/Training
- Is the device supported by the tool and has the examiner received proper training?

## Contact Expert
- The on-site examiner should contact an expert for additional assistance and guidance.

## Battery More than 50%
- Does the device show that it has more than 50% remaining battery power?

## Need More Data
- After the extraction is successful and the examiner has reviewed the results, is additional information or analysis required?

## 5. Acquisition
Acquisition is the process of imaging or otherwise obtaining information from a mobile device and its associated media. Performing an acquisition at the scene has the advantage that loss of information due to battery depletion, damage, etc. during transportation and storage is avoided. Off-site acquisitions, unlike a laboratory setting, may be challenging in finding a controlled setting in which to work with the appropriate equipment while satisfying additional prerequisites. For the purpose of this discussion, a laboratory environment is assumed throughout this chapter.

The forensic examination begins with the identification of the mobile device. The type of mobile device, its operating system, and other characteristics determine the route to take in creating a forensic copy of the contents of the device. The type of mobile device and data to be extracted generally dictates which tools and techniques should be used in an investigation.

### 5.1 Mobile Device Identification
To proceed effectively, mobile devices need to be identified by the make, model, and service provider. If the mobile device is not identifiable, photographing the front, back, and sides of the device may be useful in identifying the make, model, and current state (e.g., screen lock) at a later time. Individuals may attempt to thwart specialists by altering the mobile device to conceal its true identity. Device alteration may range from removing manufacturer labels to filing off logos. In addition, the operating system and applications may be modified or, in rare situations, completely replaced, and appear differently as well as behave differently than expected. These modifications should be taken into consideration on a case-by-case basis.

If the mobile device is powered on, the information appearing on the display may aid in mobile device identification. For example, the manufacturer’s or service provider’s name may appear on the display, or the screen layout may indicate the family of operating system used. Information such as the manufacturer’s label may be found in the battery cavity (e.g., make, model, IMEI, MEID). Removing the battery from the cavity of a mobile device, even when powered off, may affect its state, particularly the contents of volatile memory. Most mobile devices keep user data in non-volatile memory (i.e., NAND). If the mobile device is powered...# Mobile Device Identification

## Introduction
When removing a battery, it may power off the device, potentially triggering an authentication mechanism upon powering back on. Identifying a mobile device can be achieved through various clues, including:

- Manufacturer logos
- Serial numbers
- Design characteristics (e.g., candy bar, clam shell)

Knowing the make and model of a device helps limit potential service providers by differentiating the type of network the device operates over (i.e., GSM, non-GSM).

## Methods of Identification

### Device Characteristics
The make and manufacturer of a mobile device can often be identified by its observable characteristics, such as:

- Weight
- Dimensions
- Form factor

Unique design elements can aid in identification. Various websites maintain databases of mobile devices that can be queried based on selected attributes to identify a particular device and obtain its specifications and features. However, coverage may not be extensive or complete, requiring consultation of multiple repositories.

### Device Interface
The power connector can be specific to a manufacturer and may provide clues for device identification. With experience, the manufacturers of certain mobile devices can often be readily identified. Additionally, the size, number of contacts, and shape of the data cable interface are often specific to a particular manufacturer and can assist in identification.

### Device Label
For inactive mobile devices, information obtained from within the battery cavity can be helpful, especially when paired with an appropriate database. The manufacturer’s label typically lists:

- Make and model number
- Unique identifiers, such as the Federal Communications Commission Identification Number (FCC ID) and an equipment identifier (IMEI or MEID)

The FCC and equipment identifiers are commonly found on mobile devices sold in the U.S. domestic market.

## UICC and Identifiers
For all mobile devices that use a UICC, the identity module is usually located under the battery and imprinted with a unique identifier called the Integrated Circuit Card Identification (ICCID). For powered-on GSM and UMTS phones, the International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI) can be obtained by dialing *#06#. Similar codes exist for obtaining the Electronic Serial Number (ESN) or Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID) from powered-on CDMA phones.

### Databases for Device Information
Various websites offer databases that provide information about mobile devices based on identifiers, such as:

- **IMEI**: A 15-digit number indicating the manufacturer, model type, and country of approval for GSM devices. The first 8 digits, known as the Type Allocation Code (TAC), indicate the model and origin. The remainder of the IMEI is manufacturer-specific, with a check digit at the end. A database lookup service is available from the GSM numbering plan website.

- **ESN**: A 32-bit identifier recorded on a secure chip in a mobile device by the manufacturer. The first 8-14 bits identify the manufacturer, while the remaining bits provide additional information.

## Conclusion
Identifying mobile devices involves a combination of examining physical characteristics, utilizing device interfaces, and consulting databases for unique identifiers. Understanding these methods can significantly aid in the identification process.# Mobile Device Identification and Information Retrieval

## Serial Numbers and Codes
- **ESN (Electronic Serial Number)**: Many mobile devices have codes that can be input into the handset to display the ESN. Hidden menus may also be activated on certain mobile devices by placing them in “test mode” through the input of a code. Besides the ESN, other useful information such as the phone number of the device may be obtained. Manufacturer codes may be checked online at the Telecommunications Industry Association website.

## ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier)
- The ICCID of the UICC may be up to 20 digits long. It consists of an industry identifier prefix (89 for telecommunications), followed by a country code, an issuer identifier number, and an individual account identification number. The country and network operator name may be determined by the ICCID. If the ICCID does not appear on the UICC, it may be obtained with a UICC acquisition tool. The GSM numbering plan website supports ICCID queries for this information.

## FCC ID (Federal Communications Commission Identifier)
- The first 3 characters of the FCC ID are the company code; the next 14 are the product code. The FCC provides a database lookup service that can be used to identify a device manufacturer and retrieve information about the mobile device, including photos, user manuals, and radio frequency test results.

## MEID (Mobile Equipment Identifier)
- MEID consists of a set of characters 56-bits in length (14 hex digits). It contains three fields, including an 8-bit regional code (RR), a 24-bit manufacturer code, and a 24-bit manufacturer-assigned serial number. The check digit (CD) is not considered part of the MEID. The MEID was created to replace ESNs, as all ESNs were exhausted by November 2008.

## Carrier Identification
- The carrier for a mobile device may have their logo printed on the exterior. This is traditionally displayed prominently to allow for advertising and branding. This may provide the examiner with insight on which carrier the mobile device operates. Mobile devices may be unlocked and possibly re-flashed to operate using a competing carrier. One method to make this determination is to examine the UICC if present. Most carriers imprint their logo on the front of the UICC. Additionally, extraction and analysis of the ICCID provides further confirmation.

## Reverse Lookup
- The Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC) provides an automated phone system for law enforcement agencies to determine the current service provider assigned to a number and obtain contact information. This service covers both U.S. and Canadian phone numbers. If the telephone number of the mobile device is known, a reverse lookup may be used to identify the network operator and the originating city and state. For example, FoneFinder™ is a service to obtain such information. The network operator’s website typically contains lists of supported devices that may be used to narrow down and possibly identify the mobile device in question. Because phone numbers may be ported among service providers, in many situations more up-to-date information is required.

## Tool Selection and Expectations
- Once the make and model of the mobile device are known, available manuals should be retrieved and studied. The manufacturer’s website is a good place to begin. Typing the model number into a search engine may also reveal a significant amount of information about the mobile device. As mentioned earlier, the device being acquired largely dictates the choice of forensic tools. The following criteria have been suggested as a fundamental set of requirements for forensic tools, and should be considered when a choice of tools is made.# Mobile Device Data Acquisition Guidelines

## Key Attributes of Acquisition Tools

- **Usability**: The ability to present data in a form that is useful to an investigator.
- **Comprehensive**: The ability to present all data to an investigator so that both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence can be identified.
- **Accuracy**: The quality of the output of the tool has been verified.
- **Deterministic**: The ability for the tool to produce the same output when given the same set of instructions and input data.
- **Verifiable**: The ability to ensure accuracy of the output by having access to intermediate translation and presentation results.
- **Tested**: The ability to determine if known data present within the mobile device's internal memory is not modified and reported accurately by the tool.

## Recommendations for Tool Experimentation

Experimenting with various tools on test devices to determine which acquisition tools work efficiently with specific mobile device types is highly recommended. This experimentation allows for:

- Gaining familiarity with the capabilities of the tool.
- Setting up special purpose search filters and custom configurations before use in an actual case.
- Installing any needed software updates from the manufacturer.

## Established Procedures for Acquisition

Established procedures should guide the technical process of acquisition, as well as the examination of evidence. New circumstances may arise sporadically that require adjustments to existing procedures, and in some situations, new procedures and methods may need to be devised.

### Examples of New Circumstances

- UICCs being permanently bonded into a mobile device.
- Mobile devices capable of supporting multiple UICCs.
- Mobile devices that block logical acquisition ports until a connection is made with a cell tower.

Procedures must be tested to ensure that the results obtained are valid and independently reproducible. Testing should occur on the same model of mobile device before attempting procedures on the case device.

### Development and Validation of Procedures

The development and validation of the procedures should be documented and include the following steps:

1. Identifying the task or problem.
2. Proposing possible solutions.
3. Testing each solution on an identical test device and under known control conditions.
4. Evaluating the results of the test.
5. Finalizing the procedure.

## Mobile Device Memory Acquisition

Mobile devices are often submitted for laboratory processing with only specific items requested for recovery, such as call logs or graphics. If any doubt or concerns exist about the requested data, contacting the submitter for clarification is recommended.

### Importance of Complete Acquisition

Though it is not always necessary to recover all available data, a complete acquisition avoids having to redo the process later if additional data is requested. For examinations involving a limited scope search warrant (e.g., only text messages), a full memory data extraction may be completed, but care should be taken to only report items covered by the warrant.

### Establishing Connection for Data Acquisition

To acquire data from a mobile device, a connection must be established to the device.# Forensic Acquisition of Mobile Devices

## Introduction
Before performing an acquisition, the version of the tool or device being used should be documented, along with any applicable patches or errata from the manufacturer applied to the tool. Caution should be taken to avoid altering the state of a mobile device when handling it, for example, by pressing keys that may corrupt or erase data.

## Establishing Connection
Once the connection has been established, the forensic software suite or device may proceed to acquire data from the mobile device.

## Importance of Date and Time
The date and time maintained on the mobile device is an important piece of information. The date and time may have been obtained from the network or manually set by the user. Owners may manually set the day or time to different values from the actual ones, yielding misleading values in the call and message records found on the mobile device.

- If the device was on when seized, the date and time maintained and differences from a reference clock should have already been recorded. Confirmation at the time of acquisition may prove useful.
- If the mobile device was off when seized, the date and time maintained and differences from a reference clock should be recorded immediately when first powered on.
- Actions taken during acquisition, such as removal of the battery to view the device label, may affect the time and date values.

## Memory Card Acquisition
Mobile devices may provide the user with an interface for a memory card. Mobile device forensic tools that acquire the contents of a resident memory card normally perform a logical acquisition.

- If the device is found in an active state, the mobile device internal memory should be acquired before removing and performing a physical acquisition of the associated media (e.g., microSD Card).
- If the device is found in a power-off state, a physical acquisition of the removable media should be performed before the internal handset memory of the mobile device is acquired.

With either type of acquisition, the forensic tool may or may not have the capability to decode recovered data stored on the card (e.g., SMS text messages), requiring additional manual steps to be taken.

## Post-Acquisition Confirmation
After an acquisition is finished, the forensic specialist should confirm that the contents of a device were captured correctly.

- On occasion, a tool may fail without any error notification and require the specialist to reattempt acquisition.
- It is advisable to have multiple tools available and be prepared to switch to another if difficulties occur with the initial tool.

## Limitations of Logical Acquisition
Invariably, not all relevant data viewable on a mobile device using the available menus may be acquired and decoded through a logical acquisition.

- Manually scrutinizing the contents via the device interface menus while video recording the process not only allows such items to be captured and reported, but also confirms that the contents reported by the tool are consistent.# Mobile Device Forensics

## Manual Data Extraction
Manual extraction must always be done with care, preserving the integrity of the device in case further, more elaborate acquisitions are necessary. The contents of a mobile device’s memory often contain information, such as deleted data, that is not recoverable through either logical or manual extractions. Lacking a software tool able to perform a physical acquisition, it may be necessary to turn to hardware-based techniques.

### Common Techniques
Two techniques commonly used are:
- Acquisition through a standardized JTAG test interface, if supported on the device.
- Acquisition by directly reading memory that has been removed from the device [Bro12].

## GSM Mobile Device Considerations
Mobile devices that do not require a UICC are relatively straightforward as the acquisition entails a single device. Mobile devices requiring UICCs are more complex. There are two items that must be examined: the handset and the UICC. Depending on the state of the mobile device (i.e., active, inactive), the handset and UICC may be acquired jointly or separately.

It is generally accepted to process the UICC first while the device is in an inactive state. If the mobile device is active, a joint acquisition of the handset and UICC contents should be acquired first. A direct acquisition recovers deleted messages present on a UICC, while an indirect acquisition via the handset does not. The UICC must be removed from the mobile device and inserted into an appropriate reader for direct acquisition.

### Forensic Issues
A well-known forensic issue that arises when performing a joint acquisition is that the status of unread text messages changes between acquisitions. The first acquisition may alter the status flag of an unread message to read. Reading an unread text message from a UICC indirectly through the handset causes the operating system of the device to change the status flags. UICCs that are read directly by a tool do not make these modifications.

One way to avoid this issue is to omit selecting the recovery of UICC memory when performing the joint acquisition (if the tool allows such an option) [Rei08].

### Inactive Mobile Devices
If the mobile device is inactive, the contents of the UICC may be acquired independently before that of the handset. The UICC acquisition should be done directly through a PC/SC reader. The handset acquisition should be attempted without the UICC present. Many devices permit an acquisition under such conditions, allowing PIN entry for the UICC to be bypassed, if it were enabled. If the acquisition attempt is unsuccessful, the UICC may be reinserted and a second attempt made.

Performing separate independent acquisitions (i.e., acquiring the UICC before acquiring the contents of the handset) avoids any operating system-related forensic issues associated with an indirect read of UICC data. However, removing the SIM can reportedly cause data to be deleted on some mobile devices [Cas11].

## iOS Device Considerations
(Section content not provided)# Data Protection in iOS Devices

Since mid-2009, beginning with the release of the iPhone 3G, Apple has shipped all iOS devices with a dedicated cryptographic chip, making hardware accelerated encryption possible.

## Overview of Data Protection

Apple has incorporated this accelerated cryptography into the operating system, marketed as a feature named **Data Protection**. Data Protection is the combination of hardware-accelerated encryption and an authenticated cryptographic scheme, allowing any file or piece of information to be encrypted or decrypted with a separate key.

### File Encryption

Files protected with Data Protection are encrypted with a random file key, which is then encrypted using a higher tier class key, and stored as a file tag with the file. Passwords (and other sensitive small data) stored on the device are encrypted using a similar approach and are stored in the iOS keychain, a device key escrow mechanism built into the operating system.

### Access Control

Files and keychain elements are both protected by one of a number of access control keys, which are also encrypted in a way that incorporates the user’s device passcode. The passcode must be known in order to decrypt the key hierarchy protecting these select files and keychain elements, and also to disable the device’s GUI lock.

## Criticism and Vulnerabilities

The implementation of Data Protection has been criticized for a number of design flaws and was originally exploited as shown by Zdziarski in 2009. Due to the simplicity of four-digit PINs or short passwords, brute forcing the device passcode is often a computationally feasible task. In many cases, brute forcing a four-digit PIN has shown to take at most 20 minutes.

## Forensic Implications

Nevertheless, this encryption scheme poses significant challenges to the forensic investigator. The forensic examiner should be aware of these issues as well as the impact that this encryption has on any iOS-based device presented for examination. Supported devices include:

- iPhone 3GS
- iPhone 4 (both GSM and CDMA models)
- First-gen iPad
- Latest releases of iPod Touch (3rd and 4th generation)

All of these devices have the option to perform a remote wipe of data contained within them. When activated, the UID is destroyed and 256 bits of the key are destroyed, leaving the examiner with an extremely complex decryption problem.

### Recommendations for Forensic Examination

To avoid such scenarios, it is recommended that radio communications are blocked or disabled prior to an examination as well as during transportation to the lab for examination.

When Data Protection is active, the file key is obliterated when the file is deleted, leaving encrypted and generally unrecoverable file contents in unallocated space, which renders traditional carving techniques for deleted files useless. Data, however, can often be found residing inside allocated data containers (i.e., SQLite Tables) and should not be discounted or ignored as part of any examination. Recovery of such data can be challenging as SQLite data recovery may be somewhat automated (e.g., epilog), and often manual recovery may be the only option.# Forensic Investigation of Mobile Devices

## User Data Storage

Fortunately for the forensic investigator, a significant portion of user data is stored within allocated data containers, and garbage collection is not generally performed on these containers.

## iOS Backup Encryption

Apple offers a feature to users to encrypt all backup data when using iTunes (iOS 4 and later). This option, when used, will only present encrypted files from some forensic extraction tools. These backups can be decrypted using a brute force attack. Tools exist to perform this attack using GPU acceleration to facilitate a faster brute force attack.

The backup encryption feature only applies to data sent through the device’s backup service; however, a number of other services run on the device that provide clear text copies of data, even if backup encryption is active. If the acquisition tool is capable of communicating with these other services, a significant amount of clear text data can be recovered, even if the backup password is not known.

## Android Device Considerations

### Overview

Android is an operating system designed by Google primarily for mobile devices such as smartphones and some tablet computers. Android was first released in 2007, and the first Android-based phone was released in October 2008. The Android operating system is open source, and Google releases a major version about once per year.

### Device Distributions

Each one of the different versions of the operating system requires slight modifications for each family of device for full support. This has led to hundreds (if not thousands) of different distributions in the wild.

### Application Repositories

Much like Apple’s iTunes Store, Android has a main application repository called the Google Play Store. Analysis of submitted applications for soundness in the store is much lower and has resulted in many rogue applications making their way into the mainstream application pool. Dozens of other Android application repositories exist as well, leading to thousands of applications that may be encountered by the examiner.

### Data Storage

Most of the Android user and application data will be found in SQLite tables located in separate folders for each installed application. This may require the examiner to dump all data contained in all SQLite tables and perform a search of the resultant data, as less than 5% of the applications are supported by the majority of mobile forensic tools.

### Security Features

Since the operating system is designed for touch screen use, the default protection scheme for the device is a gesture password lock. The lock presents a 3x3 grid for the user to trace his/her finger connecting several cells of the grid to form a pattern. Once the correct pattern is traced, the phone is unlocked. Some forensics tools exist to obtain the `gesture.key` file to unlock the device.

### Access Methods

Most of the access methods for a locked Android device rely on debug mode to be active.# Forensics Extraction Process

## Introduction
The device to begin the forensics extraction process. A few tools have been released that can enable debug mode from a locked device; however, the number of supported models is very small.

## MicroSD Memory Cards
Most Android-based mobile devices have removable microSD memory cards. The data contained on the microSD Card should not be overlooked as they frequently contain a great deal of unencrypted and unprotected data.

### Best Practices
As best practice, the microSD card should be write-blocked and imaged using standard digital forensic techniques. The image may then be examined using traditional digital forensic tools, as the media is generally a single partition formatted using exFAT.

## JTAG Methods
Getting into locked devices is also possible using JTAG methods and tools to obtain all of the data from the memory of the handset. This bypasses the locked USB port (USB Debugging turned off) and probes Test Access Ports between the USB Port and the CPU.

### JTAG Communication
JTAG provides communication to NAND memory through the CPU allowing memory to be read. Many tools are able to parse much of the information presented in the Android OS; however, all tools suffer the same problem as iOS-based devices -- multitudes of applications.

### Application Parsing
Hundreds of applications are added every week. Understanding and reverse engineering each one of them one-at-a-time is a time-consuming process. Many vendors have chosen to focus on parsing the data from the more popular communication applications (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.).

### Advanced Examination
The more advanced examiner should be aware of this shortcoming and be prepared to perform testing and reverse engineering for some cases where support for specific applications may not yet exist.

## UICC Considerations
Similar to a mobile device, to acquire data from a UICC, a connection must be established from the forensic workstation to the UICC, using a PC/SC reader.

### Tool Documentation
As before, the version of the tool being used should be documented, along with any applicable patches or errata from the manufacturer applied to the tool. Once the connection has been established, the forensic software tool may proceed to acquire data from the UICC.

### Data Acquisition
Capturing a direct image of the UICC data is not possible because of the protection mechanisms built into the module. Instead, forensic tools send command directives called Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs) to the UICC to extract data logically, without modification, from each elementary data file of the file system.

### APDU Protocol
The APDU protocol is a simple command-response exchange. Each element of the file system defined in the GSM standards has a unique numeric identifier assigned, which can be used to walk through the file system and recover data by referencing an element and performing some operation, such as reading its contents.

### Standardization
Because UICCs are highly standardized devices, few issues exist with regard to a logical acquisition. The main consideration is selecting a tool that reports the status.# Data Recovery and Tangential Equipment

## 5.4 Tangential Equipment
Tangential equipment includes devices that contain memory and are associated with a mobile device. The three main categories are:

- Memory cards
- Host computers to which a mobile device has synchronized its contents
- Cloud-based storage

Smartphones may provide an interface that supports removable media (e.g., microSD or MMC), which may contain significant amounts of data. Memory cards are typically flash memory, used as auxiliary user file storage, or as a means to convey files to and from the device. Data may be acquired with the use of a write-blocked media reader and a forensic application.

The data contained on a mobile device is often present on a personal computer, due to the capability of mobile devices to synchronize or otherwise share information among one or more host computers. Such personal computers or workstations are referred to as synched devices. Because of synchronization, a significant amount of data on a mobile device may be present on the owner’s laptop or personal computer and recovered using a conventional computer forensic tool for hard drive acquisition and examination [Bad10].

### 5.4.1 Synched Devices
Synchronization refers to the process of resolving differences in certain classes of data, such as e-mail residing on two devices (i.e., a mobile phone and a personal computer), to obtain a version that reflects any actions taken by the user (e.g., deletions or additions) on one device or the other.

Synchronization of information may occur at either the record level or the file level. When done at the file level, any discrepancies from the last synchronization date and time result in the latest version automatically replacing the older version. Occasionally, manual intervention may be needed if both versions were modified independently since the last synchronization occurred. Record level synchronization is done similarly, but with more granularity, whereby only out-of-date parts of a file are resolved and replaced.

Mobile devices are typically populated with data from the personal computer during the synchronization process. A significant amount of informative data may reside locally on a personal computer. Data from the mobile device may also be synchronized to the computer, through user-defined preferences in the synchronization software. Because the synchronized contents of a mobile device and personal computer tend to diverge quickly over time, additional information may be found in one device or the other.

The synchronization software and the device type determine where mobile device data is stored and how it can be accessed.# Storage and Forensics of Mobile Devices

## 5.4.2 Memory Cards

Memory card storage capacity ranges from 128MB and up. As technological advances are made, such media becomes physically smaller and offers larger storage densities. Removable media extends the storage capacity of mobile devices, allowing individuals to store additional files beyond the device’s built-in capacity and to share data between compatible devices.

Some forensics tools are able to acquire the contents of memory cards; many are not. If the acquisition is logical, deleted data present on the card is not recovered. Fortunately, such media can be treated similarly to a removable disk drive and imaged and analyzed using conventional forensic tools with the use of an external media reader.

A physical acquisition of data present on removable media provides the examiner the potential to search the contents of the media and potentially recover deleted files. One drawback is that mobile device data, such as SMS text messages, may require manual decoding or a separate decoding tool to interpret. A more serious issue is that content protection features incorporated into the card may block the recovery of data. For instance, BlackBerry™ devices provide the user with the ability to encrypt data contained on the removable media associated with the mobile device.

**Table 4** gives a brief overview of various storage media in use today.

## 5.5 Cloud Based Services for Mobile Devices

Mobile cloud computing is the combination of mobile networks and cloud computing, allowing user applications and data to be stored on the cloud (i.e., internet servers) rather than the mobile device memory. This data may be stored across geographically diverse locations. Cloud computing environments are complex in their design and frequently geographically disperse. Often, storage locations for cloud computing are chosen due to lowest cost and data redundancy requirements. One issue may be identification of the location of the data. This is an emerging field.

Cloud storage opens numerous possibilities for mobile device application developers beyond mobile device memory limitations. As mobile applications evolve, data retrieval becomes seamless to the user and not apparent if data is stored on the cloud or the internal memory of the mobile device.

There are several factors within cloud computing environments that challenge forensics examiners, requiring a hybrid approach to include both live and “dead box” forensic techniques. Additionally, recovery of user data stored in the cloud may become more problematic based on laws and regulations. Retrieval and analysis of cloud-based data should follow agency-specific guidelines on cloud forensics.# Mobile Device Forensics Examination

The mobile device forensics examiner should not discount cloud-based data left behind (e.g., browser cache or other forensics artifacts) that may be present on tangential equipment, enabling an examiner to piece together what has occurred on a device.

## 6. Examination and Analysis

The examination process uncovers digital evidence, including that which may be hidden or obscured. The results are gained through applying established scientifically based methods and should describe the content and state of the data fully, including the source and the potential significance. Data reduction, separating relevant from irrelevant information, occurs once the data is exposed.

The analysis process differs from examination in that it looks at the results of the examination for its direct significance and probative value to the case. Examination is a technical process that is the province of a forensic specialist. However, analysis may be done by roles other than a specialist, such as the investigator or the forensic examiner.

The examination process begins with a copy of the evidence acquired from the mobile device. Fortunately, compared with classical examination of personal computers or network servers, the amount of acquired data to examine is much smaller with mobile devices. Because of the prevalence of proprietary case file formats, the forensic toolkit used for acquisition will typically be the one used for examination and analysis. While interoperability among the acquisition and examination facilities of different tools is possible, only a few tools support this feature. Examination and analysis using third-party tools are generally accomplished by importing a generated mobile device memory dump into a mobile forensics tool that supports third-party mobile device images.

The forensic examiner will need information about the case and the parties involved to provide a starting point for potential evidence that might be found. Conducting the examination is a partnership between the forensic analyst or examiner and the investigator. The investigator provides insight into the types of information sought, while the forensic examiner provides the means to find relevant information that might be on the system.

The understanding gained by studying the case should provide ideas about the type of data to target and specific keywords or phrases to use when searching the acquired data. Depending on the type of case, the strategy varies. For example, a case about child pornography may begin with browsing all of the graphic images on the system, while a case about an Internet-related offense might begin with browsing all Internet history files.

### 6.1 Potential Evidence

Mobile device manufacturers typically offer a similar set of information handling features and capabilities, including Personal Information Management (PIM) applications, messaging and e-mail, and web browsing. The set of features and capabilities vary based on the device.# Mobile Device Forensics

## Overview
The potential evidence on mobile devices may include various types of data that can be crucial for investigations. This data can provide insights into the device's usage, user behavior, and interactions.

## Types of Evidence
The following items may be found on mobile devices:

- **Subscriber and Equipment Identifiers**
- **Date/Time, Language, and Other Settings**
- **Phonebook/Contact Information**
- **Calendar Information**
- **Text Messages**
- **Outgoing, Incoming, and Missed Call Logs**
- **Electronic Mail**
- **Photos**
- **Audio and Video Recordings**
- **Multi-Media Messages**
- **Instant Messaging**
- **Web Browsing Activities**
- **Electronic Documents**
- **Social Media Related Data**
- **Application Related Data**
- **Location Information**
- **Geolocation Data**

## Network Information
Even esoteric network information found on a UICC (Universal Integrated Circuit Card) may prove useful in an investigation. For example, if a network rejects a location update from a phone attempting to register itself, the list of forbidden network entries in the Forbidden PLMNs (Public Land Mobile Networks) elementary file is updated with the code of the country and network involved. This list is maintained on the UICC and is due to service being declined by a foreign provider. The mobile device of an individual suspected of traveling to a neighboring country might be checked for this information.

## Device and Service Dependency
The items present on a device are dependent not only on the features and capabilities of the mobile device but also on the voice and data services subscribed to by the user. For example, prepaid phone service may rule out the possibility for multi-media messaging, electronic mail, and web browsing. Similarly, a contract subscription may selectively exclude certain types of service, though the phone itself may support them.

## Types of Forensic Investigations
Two types of computer forensic investigations generally take place:

1. **Unknown Offender Investigation**: An incident has occurred, but the identity of the offender is unknown (e.g., a hacking incident).
2. **Known Offender Investigation**: The suspect and the incident are both known (e.g., a child-porn investigation).

## Objectives of Forensic Examination
Prepared with the background of the incident, the forensic examiner and analyst may proceed toward accomplishing the following objectives:

- **Gather Information**: About the individual(s) involved {who}.
- **Determine Nature of Events**: The exact nature of the events that occurred {what}.
- **Construct Timeline**: A timeline of events {when}.
- **Uncover Motivation**: Information that explains the motivation for the offense {why}.
- **Discover Tools Used**: What tools or exploits were used {how}.

## Conclusion
In many instances, the data is peripheral to an investigation or useful in substantiating or refuting the claims of an individual about some incident. On occasion, direct knowledge, motivation, and intention may be established. Most of the evidence sources from mobile devices can play a critical role in the forensic analysis process.# Mobile Device Forensics

## Types of Evidence from Mobile Devices
Mobile devices can provide various types of evidence, including:

- **Contact Data**
- **Call Data**
- **Messaging**
- **Pictures**
- **Video**
- **Social Media**
- **Internet-related Information**

User applications may also offer additional sources of evidence. User files stored on the device for rendering, viewing, or editing are significant evidence sources. Relevant file content includes:

- Graphic files
- Audio and video recordings
- Spreadsheets
- Presentation slides
- Other electronic documents

Installed executable programs may also be relevant in certain situations. Often, the most crucial data recovered links to information held by the service provider.

## Service Provider Data
Service providers maintain databases for billing or debiting accounts based on call logs, which can be queried using subscriber or equipment identifiers. Additionally, undelivered SMS text messages, multimedia, or voice messages may also be recoverable. This allows an examiner to validate findings, as data obtained from the device can be verified with data from the service provider.

## Enhanced 911 (E911)
Enhanced 911 (E911) is a technology advanced by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that enables mobile devices to process 911 calls and provide the geographic location of the handset. Key points include:

- All U.S.-based mobile devices can establish cellular voice communication when dialing 911, regardless of their service status (active or inactive).
- GSM and other UICC-dependent devices can also establish cellular voice communication by dialing 911 without the presence of a UICC.
- All U.S. cellular carriers are required to handle calls regardless of the mobile device customer's specific carrier.
- Mobile devices manufactured for sale in the U.S. after February 13, 2000, capable of operating in an analog mode, must include this special method for processing 911 calls.

In situations where 911 was dialed on a mobile device, the location information (latitude and longitude of the device or cell tower) may be of interest to a forensic investigator. Outgoing 911 calls may or may not be logged in the memory of the mobile device or UICC.

## Applying Mobile Device Forensic Tools
Once a copy of the acquisition results is available, the next steps involve:

1. Searching the data
2. Identifying evidence
3. Creating bookmarks
4. Developing the contents of a final report

Knowledge and experience with the tools used for examination are extremely valuable, as proficient use of the available features and capabilities of a forensic tool can greatly speed up the examination process.

It is important to note that forensic tools may contain some degree of error in their operation. Potential issues include:

- Programming errors in the tool's implementation
- Inaccurate or outdated specifications of file structures used by the tool to translate bits into comprehensible data
- File structures generated by another source that may not align with the tool's requirements# Mobile Device Forensics

## Introduction
The program as input may be incorrect, causing the tool to function improperly. Experiments conducted with mobile device forensic tools indicate a prevalence of errors in the formatting and display of data [Aye11, Jan09]. Therefore, having a high degree of trust and understanding of the tool’s ability to perform its function properly is essential.

## Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT)
The Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) produces specifications, test methods, and test reports that provide a foundation for toolmakers to improve tools, users to make informed choices, and provide interested parties with an overview of any anomalies found. CFTT has spent several years researching and testing forensic tools capable of acquiring data from the internal memory of mobile devices and Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs).

## Tampering and Limitations
A knowledgeable individual may tamper with device information, such as purposefully modifying a file extension to foil the workings of a tool, altering the date/time of the mobile device to falsify timestamps associated with logged activities, creating false transactions in the memory of the mobile device or its UICC, or utilizing a wiping tool to remove or eliminate data from memory. Seasoned experience with a tool provides an understanding of its limitations, allowing an examiner to compensate for them and minimize errors to achieve the best possible results.

## Evidence Uncovering
To uncover evidence, specialists should gain a background of the suspect, offense, and determine a set of terms for the examination. Search expressions should be developed in a systematic fashion, such as using contact names that may be relevant. By proceeding systematically, the specialist creates a profile for potential leads that may unveil valuable findings.

## Suggestions for Analysis
Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence – A Guide for Law Enforcement, produced by the U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ08], offers the following suggestions for the analysis of extracted data:

### Ownership and Possession
- Identify the individuals who created, modified, or accessed a file.
- Determine the ownership and possession of questioned data by placing the subject with the device at a particular time and date.
- Locate files of interest in non-default locations.
- Recover passwords that indicate possession or ownership.
- Identify contents of files that are specific to a user.

### Application and File Analysis
- Identify information relevant to the investigation by examining file content.
- Correlate files to installed applications.
- Identify relationships between files (e.g., e-mail files to e-mail attachments).
- Determine the significance of unknown file types.
- Examine system configuration settings.
- Examine file metadata (e.g., documents containing authorship identification).

### Timeframe Analysis
- Determine when events occurred on the system to associate usage with an individual by reviewing any logs present and the date/time stamps in the file system, such as the last modified time.
- Besides call logs, consider the date/time and other relevant timestamps.# Data Recovery and Analysis

## Introduction
The content of messages and emails can prove useful in various investigations. Such data can also be corroborated with billing and subscriber records kept by the service provider.

## Data Hiding Analysis
- **Detect and Recover Hidden Data**: This involves identifying knowledge, ownership, or intent by correlating file headers to file extensions to show intentional obfuscation.
- **Accessing Protected Files**: This includes gaining access to password-protected, encrypted, and compressed files, as well as steganographic information detected in images.
- **Reserved Areas of Data Storage**: Accessing reserved areas of data storage outside the normal file system is also crucial.

The capabilities of the tool and the richness of its features, versus the operating system and type of device under examination, determine what information can be recovered, identified, and reported, as well as the amount of effort needed.

## Search Engine Capabilities
The search engine plays a significant role in the discovery of information used for the creation of bookmarks and final reporting. For example:
- Some tools used to search for textual evidence identify and categorize files based on file extension.
- Others utilize a file signature database, which is preferable as it eliminates the possibility of missing data due to inconsistent file name extensions (e.g., a text file whose extension was changed to that of a graphics or image file).

The ability for the tool to find and gather images automatically into a common graphics library for examination is extremely useful.

## Searching for Evidence
Searching data for information on incriminating or exculpatory evidence takes patience and can be time-consuming.
- Some tools have a simple search engine that matches an input text string exactly, allowing only for elementary searches.
- Other tools incorporate more intelligent and feature-rich search engines, allowing for generalized regular expression patterns (grep) type searches, including wildcard matches, filtering of files by extension, directory, and batch scripts that search for specific types of content (e.g., email addresses, URLs).

The greater the tool’s capabilities, the more the forensic examiner benefits from experience with and knowledge of the tool.

## Call and Subscriber Records
Records maintained by the service provider capture information needed to accurately bill a subscriber or, in the case of a prepaid service plan, debit the balance.

### Call Detail Records (CDRs)
- CDRs are generated by the switch handling an originating call or SMS message from a mobile device.
- For some service providers, the records may also include fixed line, international gateway, and voice over IP transaction information.

While the content and format of these records differ widely from one service provider to another, the fundamental data needed to identify the subscriber/device initiating the call, the initial cell servicing the call, the number dialed, and the duration of the call is captured.

### Detailed Information
Detailed information such as the identifier of the cell (i.e., the BTS) is also included in these records.# Data Retention and Call Detail Records

## Overview
The sector involved often includes various service providers and network operators. Appendix C provides an example of the data elements of a Call Detail Record (CDR), as specified in the GSM standards [ETS99]. There is considerable discretion regarding what is implemented, which is left to the service providers and network operators.

## Retention Period
The retention period for maintaining call detail and other types of records varies among service providers [GSM05]. Generally, this period is limited, necessitating immediate action to avoid data loss. It is crucial to act quickly to have the cellular carrier preserve any data that can identify communications linked to the parties of interest, while stressing non-disclosure of that action to the account subscriber [Ala03, Ala04].

## Types of Data Available
The data available may include:
- Subscriber records
- Content of email servers (i.e., undelivered email)
- Email server logs
- Other IP address authentication logs
- Content of SMS and MMS message servers
- Content of voicemail servers

### Legal Considerations
Certain types of undelivered content, such as voicemail, may be considered in transit from a legal standpoint in some jurisdictions. Obtaining or listening to them without proper authority may be treated as an illegal interception of communications [Ala03]. While the USA PATRIOT Act eliminated this issue at the federal level, state statutes may be more restrictive or not yet fully aligned with federal statutes.

## Call Detail Records (CDRs)
CDRs typically contain information such as:
- Sender and receiver phone numbers
- Time and duration of the call
- Call type (i.e., voice, SMS)

CDRs can be obtained from U.S. service providers through their law enforcement point of contact, provided the appropriate legal documentation is in place. Procedures may vary among states in the U.S., and new laws regarding proper seizure are continually legislated. Additionally, procedures for obtaining records from service providers and network operators located in other countries may differ. Close and ongoing consultation with legal counsel is advised. Various online law enforcement forums can also assist in identifying points of contact and sharing tips on procedures for accurately obtaining the required data.

## Subscriber Records
Besides call detail records, subscriber records maintained by a service provider can provide useful data in an investigation. For GSM systems, the database usually contains the following information about each customer [Wil03]:
- Customer name and address
- Billing name and address (if different from customer)
- User name and address (if different from customer)
- Billing account details
- Telephone number (MSISDN)
- IMSI
- UICC serial number (ICCID)
- PIN/PUK for the UICC
- Services allowed

Other useful information may include phone numbers (i.e., work or home) and additional contact information.# Subscriber Records and Call Detail Records (CDRs)

## Overview
Subscriber records may retain various types of information, including email addresses and credit card numbers used by subscribers.

## Prepaid Phones
- Pay-as-you-go prepaid phones purchased anonymously may also have useful information maintained with their accounts.
- Information supplied by subscribers can include:
- Credit card numbers used for purchases of additional time.
- Email addresses registered online for notifications.
- Accessing call records of prepaid phones should not be ruled out.

## Requesting CDRs
- CDRs and other records maintained by the service provider can be requested using:
- Subscriber or equipment identifier information seized or acquired from a mobile device or UICC.
- Common subscriber information includes:
- IMSI from the UICC.
- Mobile device number (MSISDN).
- Equipment identifiers used include:
- ESN or IMEI of the phone.
- Serial number (ICCID) of the UICC.

## Search Criteria
- Search criteria may include:
- All calls received by a certain phone number (e.g., that of a victim).
- All calls handled by a base station responsible for a particular cell (to determine who was in a certain area at a certain time) [Wil03].
- Initial records obtained often lead to additional requests for related records of other subscribers and equipment based on the data uncovered.

## Analyzing CDRs
- CDRs can be analyzed for various purposes, such as:
- Understanding calling patterns of subscribers.
- Evaluating network performance [Aja06].
- Call detail records can be combined with cell site tower information to:
- Translate cell identifiers into geographical locations.
- Identify the general locale from which calls were placed.

## Limitations of CDR Analysis
- While plotting call record locations onto a map can be useful, it may not provide a complete and accurate picture:
- Cell towers can service phones at distances of up to 35 kilometers (approximately 21 miles) and may service several distinct sectors.
- Radio frequency coverage maps maintained by the service provider can be obtained for a more accurate portrayal of the data for the sectors involved.

## Applications of Data Analysis
- The results of data analysis can be used to:
- Determine the location of the mobile device at a given time [Oco09].
- Establish timelines and identify possible co-conspirators [Mil08].
- A change of cell identifier between the beginning and the end of a call, or over a series of calls, may indicate a general direction of travel or pattern of behavior.

## Factors Affecting Cell Coverage
- The boundaries of a cell are variable and can be influenced by:
- Terrain.
- Seasonal changes.
- Antenna performance.
- Call loading.# Cell Site Analysis and Mapping

## Overview
Cell site analysis and mapping are crucial for law enforcement to associate call records with plausible locales. Detailed field tests and measurements may be required to ensure an accurate analysis.

## Tools for Law Enforcement
Tools exist to aid law enforcement in performing cell site analysis and mapping activities independently. In densely populated urban locations, such as those involving microcells or picocells with limited coverage areas, location determination may be relatively straightforward due to the nature of the network.

## Importance of Geographical Coverage
Identifying the geographical coverage of specific cells can provide valuable information when combined with call detail records. This can help geographically establish plausible locations with some degree of certainty for the times involved.

## Criminal Evasion Tactics
Professional criminals are aware of these capabilities and may attempt to exploit them by having someone use their mobile device to establish a false alibi. Common evasion tactics include:
- Purchasing, using, and quickly disposing of pay-as-you-go prepaid phones to minimize exposure.
- Using stolen phones.
- Swapping different UICCs among various GSM/UMTS mobile devices to obfuscate usage and complicate record analysis.

## Analyzing Call Records
Careful analysis of call records, in conjunction with other available data, can help establish the relationship between the mobile device and its owner. For example:
- Call detail records of pay-as-you-go prepaid phones are maintained by network providers, similar to contract subscriptions.
- By analyzing communication patterns and mapping data to known associates of a suspect, ownership of such phones can be established.
- Other traditional forms of forensic evidence, such as fingerprinting and DNA, may also be used to establish ownership.

## Network Traffic Information
Network traffic information, which quantifies the amount of data transferred to and from the device, is frequently reported and may aid investigators in specific investigations.

# Reporting

## Definition
Reporting is the process of preparing a detailed summary of all steps taken and conclusions reached during the investigation of a case. It relies on maintaining a careful record of all actions and observations, describing the results of tests and examinations, and explaining the inferences drawn from the data.

## Importance of Documentation
A good report depends on solid documentation, including:
- Notes
- Photographs
- Tool-generated content

## Reporting Process
Reporting occurs once the data has been thoroughly searched and relevant items bookmarked. Many forensic tools come with built-in reporting facilities that typically follow predefined templates and may allow for customization of the report structure.

## Customization Options
Permitted customizations may include:
- Organization logos
- Report headers
- Selection of styles and structure to provide a more professional appearance tailored to the organization’s needs.

## Contents of Forensic Reports
Reports generated by forensic tools typically include items from the case file, such as the findings and analyses conducted during the investigation.# Forensic Report Generation

## Overview
A forensic report typically includes the specialist’s name, a case number, a date and title, the categories of evidence, and the relevant evidence found. Report generation can either output all of the data obtained or allow examiners to select relevant data (i.e., bookmarked items) for the final report. Including only relevant findings minimizes the report's size and reduces confusion for the reader.

## Components of the Report
The software-generated contents are just one part of the overall report. The final report should contain:

- Software-generated contents
- Data accumulated throughout the investigation
- Summary of actions taken
- Analysis performed
- Relevance of the evidence uncovered

Ideally, supporting documentation should be in electronic form and able to be incorporated directly into the report.

## Reporting Facilities
Reporting facilities vary significantly across mobile device acquisition applications. Report generation typically can render a complete report in one of several common formats (e.g., .txt, .csv, .doc, .html, .pdf) or at least provide a means to export individual data items for manual report composition. Some tools may lack report generation or data export capabilities, requiring examiners to capture individual screenshots of the tool interface for later assembly into a report format.

### Importance of Consistency
Regardless of how reports are generated, it is vital to check that the finalized report is consistent with the data presented in the user interface representation to identify and eliminate any possible inconsistencies.

## Modifying Reports
The ability to modify a pre-existing report and incorporate data (e.g., images, video stills) captured by alternative means is advantageous. Auxiliary acquisition techniques may be required to recover specific data types. For example, video recording a manual examination can document the recovery of data that the automated forensic tool may not have acquired. Video editing software allows still images to be captured for inclusion in the report.

### Alternative Documentation Methods
Pictures could also be taken of the manual exam using a digital camera; however, this process is less efficient and may not document the entire process, but it may be the only method available.

## Presenting Data
The type of data determines whether it is presentable in a hard-copy format. Many popular mobile devices can capture audio and video, which cannot easily be presented in a printed format. Such evidentiary data should be included with the finalized report on removable media (e.g., CD-R, DVD-R, or flash drive) along with the appropriate application for proper display.

## Report Contents
Reports of forensic examination results should include all the information necessary to identify the case and its source, outline the test results and findings, and bear the signature of the individual responsible for its contents. In general, the report may include the following information:

- Identity of the reporting agency# Digital Evidence Examination Report

## Case Information
- **Case Identifier or Submission Number**
- **Case Investigator**
- **Identity of the Submitter**
- **Date of Evidence Receipt**
- **Date of Report**

## Items Submitted for Examination
- **Descriptive List of Items**: Include serial number, make, and model.
- **Identity and Signature of the Examiner**
- **Equipment and Setup Used in the Examination**
- **Brief Description of Steps Taken During Examination**: Such as string searches, graphics image searches, and recovering erased files.

## Supporting Materials
- Printouts of particular items of evidence
- Digital copies of evidence
- Chain of custody documentation

## Details of Findings
- **Specific Files Related to the Request**
- **Other Files**: Including deleted files that support the findings.
- **Search Techniques**: String searches, keyword searches, and text string searches.
- **Internet-Related Evidence**: Such as website traffic analysis, chat logs, cache files, email, and newsgroup activity.
- **Graphic Image Analysis**
- **Indicators of Ownership**: Could include program registration data.
- **Data Analysis**
- **Description of Relevant Programs**: On the examined items.
- **Techniques Used to Hide or Mask Data**: Such as encryption, steganography, hidden attributes, hidden partitions, and file name anomalies.

## Report Conclusions
Digital evidence, as well as the tools, techniques, and methodologies used in an examination, is subject to being challenged in a court of law or other formal proceedings. Proper documentation is essential in providing individuals the ability to re-create the process from beginning to end.

As part of the reporting process, making a copy of the software used and including it with the output produced is advisable when custom tools are used for examination or analysis, should it become necessary to reproduce forensic processing results.
