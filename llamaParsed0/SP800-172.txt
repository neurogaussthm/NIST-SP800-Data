# Abstract

The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) resident in nonfederal systems and organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal Government to successfully conduct its essential missions and functions. This publication provides federal agencies with recommended enhanced security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI:

1. When the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations.
2. When the nonfederal organization is not collecting or maintaining information on behalf of a federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf of an agency.
3. Where there are no specific safeguarding requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or government-wide policy for the CUI category listed in the CUI Registry.

The enhanced requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide security protection for such components when the designated CUI is associated with a critical program or high value asset. The enhanced requirements supplement the basic and derived security requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-171 and are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations.

## How to Use This Publication

This publication is a supplement to NIST Special Publication 800-171 [SP 800-171]. It contains recommendations for enhanced security requirements to provide additional protection for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal systems and organizations when such information is associated with critical programs or high value assets.

The enhanced security requirements are designed to respond to the advanced persistent threat (APT) and supplement the basic and derived security requirements in [SP 800-171]. While the security requirements in [SP 800-171] focus primarily on confidentiality protection, the enhanced security requirements in this publication address confidentiality, integrity, and availability protection. The enhanced security requirements are implemented in addition to the basic and derived requirements since those requirements are not designed to address the APT.

The enhanced security requirements apply to those components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components.

There is no expectation that all of the enhanced security requirements will be selected by federal agencies implementing this guidance. The decision to select a particular set of enhanced security requirements will be based on the mission and business needs of federal agencies and guided and informed by ongoing risk assessments. The enhanced security requirements for nonfederal...# Systems Processing, Storing, or Transmitting CUI

Systems processing, storing, or transmitting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) associated with critical programs or high-value assets will be conveyed to nonfederal organizations by federal agencies in a contract, grant, or other agreement. The application of the enhanced security requirements to subcontractors will also be addressed by federal agencies in consultation with nonfederal organizations.

## The Applicability of Enhanced Security Requirements

The enhanced security requirements are only applicable to a nonfederal system or nonfederal organization as mandated by a federal agency in a contract, grant, or other agreement. The requirements apply to the components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI associated with a critical program or a high-value asset or that provide protection for such components.

The requirements also apply to services, including externally provided services, that process, store, or transmit CUI, or that provide security protections for the system requiring enhanced protection. The protection of a specific service to include CUI that is processed, stored, or transmitted during the provision of that service is achieved by implementing the enhanced security requirements for the service, or the system or system components responsible for providing that service.

In addition to protecting CUI from unauthorized disclosure, the enhanced security requirements have been designed to protect the integrity and availability of CUI. This is achieved by promoting penetration-resistant architectures, damage-limiting operations, and designs to help achieve cyber resiliency and survivability.

The term **organizational system** is used in many of the enhanced security requirements. It has a specific meaning regarding the applicability of the enhanced requirements as described above. Appropriate scoping considerations for the requirements are important factors in determining protection-related investment decisions and managing security risk for nonfederal organizations that have the responsibility of protecting CUI associated with critical programs and high-value assets.

## Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity

Organizations that have implemented or plan to implement the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (NIST CSF) can find in Appendix C a mapping of the enhanced security requirements in this publication to the security controls in SP 800-53. The security control mappings can be useful to organizations that wish to demonstrate compliance with the security requirements in the context of their established information security programs when such programs have been built using the NIST security controls.

# Chapter One

## Introduction

### The Need to Protect Controlled Unclassified Information

Today, more than at any time in history, the Federal Government relies on external service...# Federal Information Protection

## Overview
Federal contractors play a crucial role in supporting a wide range of federal missions and business functions through the use of information systems. These contractors often process, store, and transmit sensitive federal information to deliver essential products and services to federal agencies. Examples of these services include:

- Financial services
- Web and electronic mail services
- Processing security clearances or healthcare data
- Providing cloud services
- Developing communications, satellite, and weapons systems

## Importance of Information Protection
Sensitive federal information is frequently shared with various entities, including:

- State and local governments
- Colleges and universities
- Independent research organizations

The protection of this information while it resides in nonfederal systems and organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies. It can directly impact the Federal Government's ability to carry out its designated missions and business operations.

## Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Program
The protection of unclassified federal information in nonfederal systems and organizations relies on the Federal Government's ability to identify the different types of information used by federal agencies.

### Establishment of CUI Program
Executive Order 13556 established a government-wide Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Program aimed at standardizing how the executive branch handles unclassified information that requires protection.

### Designation of CUI
Only information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls, as mandated by federal law, regulation, or government-wide policy, may be designated as CUI. The CUI Program addresses several deficiencies in managing and protecting unclassified information, including:

- Inconsistent markings
- Inadequate safeguarding
- Needless restrictions

This is achieved by standardizing procedures and providing common definitions through the CUI Registry.

## CUI Registry
The CUI Registry serves as the online repository for information, guidance, policy, and requirements related to handling CUI. It includes:

- Issuances by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) CUI Executive Agent
- Approved CUI categories
- General descriptions for each category
- Basis for controls
- Procedures for the use of CUI, including marking, safeguarding, transporting, disseminating, reusing, and disposing of the information

## Emphasis on Openness and Transparency
Executive Order 13556 also mandates that the CUI Program emphasize openness, transparency, and uniformity in government-wide practices. The implementation of the program must align with applicable policies established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal standards and guidelines issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

## Federal CUI Regulation
The federal CUI regulation, developed by the CUI Executive Agent, provides guidance to federal agencies on:

- Designation
- Safeguarding
- Dissemination
- Marking
- Decontrolling
- Disposition of CUI

It also establishes self-inspection protocols to ensure compliance with these guidelines.# Oversight Requirements

In certain situations, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) may be associated with a critical program or a high-value asset. These critical programs and high-value assets are potential targets for the advanced persistent threat (APT).

## Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)

An APT is an adversary or adversarial group that possesses the expertise and resources that allow it to create opportunities to achieve its objectives by using multiple attack vectors, including cyber, physical, and deception. The APT objectives include:

- Establishing a foothold within the infrastructure of targeted organizations for purposes of exfiltrating information.
- Undermining or impeding critical aspects of a mission, function, program, or organization.
- Positioning itself to carry out these objectives in the future.

The APT pursues its objectives repeatedly over an extended period, adapts to defenders' efforts to resist it, and is determined to maintain the level of interaction needed to execute its objectives.

While the category of CUI itself does not require greater protection, CUI associated with critical programs or high-value assets is at greater risk because the APT is more likely to target such information and therefore requires additional protection.

## CUI Enhanced Security Requirements

Controlled Unclassified Information has the same value, whether such information is resident in a federal system that belongs to a federal agency or a nonfederal system that belongs to a nonfederal organization. Accordingly, the enhanced security requirements in this publication are consistent with and complementary to the guidelines used by federal agencies to protect CUI.

The requirements are only applicable to a nonfederal system or nonfederal organization as mandated by a federal agency in a contract, grant, or other agreement.

The APT is extremely dangerous to the national and economic security interests of the United States since organizations are very dependent on systems of all types, including:

- Traditional Information Technology (IT) systems
- Operational Technology (OT) systems
- Internet of Things (IoT) systems
- Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems

The convergence of these types of systems has brought forth a new class of systems known as cyber-physical systems, many of which are in sectors of U.S. critical infrastructure, including energy, transportation, defense, manufacturing, healthcare, finance, and information and communications.

Therefore, CUI that is processed, stored, or transmitted by any of the above systems related to a critical program or high-value asset requires additional protection from the APT.

## 1.1 Purpose and Applicability

The purpose of this publication is to provide federal agencies with a set of enhanced security requirements for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CUI:

1. When the CUI is resident in a nonfederal system and organization.
2. When the nonfederal organization is not collecting or maintaining information on behalf of a federal agency or using.# Enhanced Security Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)

## Overview
The enhanced security requirements address the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) by promoting:
1. Penetration-resistant architecture
2. Damage-limiting operations
3. Designs to achieve cyber resiliency and survivability

These requirements are intended to supplement the basic and derived security requirements in [SP 800-171] and are for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations.

## Applicability
The enhanced security requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that:
- Process, store, or transmit CUI associated with a critical program or a high-value asset
- Provide security protection for such components

If nonfederal organizations designate specific system components for the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI associated with a critical program or a high-value asset, those organizations may limit the scope of the enhanced security requirements by isolating the designated system components in a separate CUI security domain.

### Isolation Techniques
Isolation can be achieved by applying architectural and design concepts, such as:
- Implementing subnetworks with firewalls or other boundary protection devices
- Using information flow control mechanisms

Security domains may employ:
- Physical separation
- Logical separation
- A combination of both

This approach can provide adequate protection for the CUI and avoid increasing the organization’s security posture to a level beyond that which it requires for protecting its missions, operations, and assets.

## Organizational Guidance
This publication does not provide guidance on which organizational programs or assets are determined to be critical or of high value. Those determinations are made by the organizations mandating the use of the enhanced security requirements for additional protection and can be informed and guided by:
- Laws
- Executive orders
- Directives
- Regulations
- Policies

Additionally, this publication does not provide guidance on specific types of threats or attack scenarios that justify the use of the enhanced security requirements. There is no expectation that all of the enhanced security requirements will be needed in every situation. Rather, the selection decisions will be made by organizations based on mission and business needs and risk.

## Target Audience
This publication serves individuals and organizations in the public and private sectors with:
- System development life cycle responsibilities (e.g., program managers, mission or business owners, information owners or stewards, system designers and developers, system and security engineers, systems integrators)
- System, security, or risk management and oversight responsibilities# Authorizing Officials and Responsibilities

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Authorizing Officials**: Chief information officers, chief information security officers, system owners, information security managers.
- **Security Assessment and Monitoring Responsibilities**: Auditors, system evaluators, assessors, independent verifiers or validators, analysts.
- **Acquisition or Procurement Responsibilities**: Contracting officers.

The above roles and responsibilities can be viewed from two distinct perspectives:
1. **Federal Perspective**: The entity establishing and conveying the security requirements in contractual vehicles or other types of inter-organizational agreements.
2. **Nonfederal Perspective**: The entity responding to and complying with the security requirements set forth in contracts or agreements.

# Chapter Two: The Fundamentals

## Assumptions for Developing Enhanced Security Requirements

This chapter describes the approach used to develop the enhanced security requirements to protect CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. It also covers the organization and structure of the enhanced security requirements and provides links to the security control mapping tables in Appendix C.

### 2.1 Development Approach

The enhanced security requirements described in this publication have been developed based on four fundamental assumptions:
- **Statutory and Regulatory Consistency**: Requirements for the protection of CUI are consistent, whether such information resides in federal or nonfederal systems and organizations.
- **Consistent Safeguards**: Safeguards implemented to protect CUI are consistent in federal and nonfederal systems and organizations.
- **Impact Value**: The impact value for CUI is no less than [FIPS 199] moderate.
- **Additional Protections**: Additional protections are necessary to protect CUI associated with critical programs or high-value assets.

These assumptions reinforce the concept that CUI has the same value and potential adverse impact if compromised, whether such information is located in a federal or a nonfederal system.# Enhanced Security Requirements for Nonfederal Organizations

## Introduction
The development of enhanced security requirements and the expectations of federal agencies in working with nonfederal organizations are influenced by several assumptions:

- Nonfederal organizations have specific safeguarding measures in place to protect their information, which may also be sufficient to satisfy the enhanced security requirements.
- Nonfederal organizations can implement a variety of security solutions directly or using external service providers (e.g., managed services) to satisfy the enhanced security requirements.
- Nonfederal organizations may not have the necessary organizational structure or resources to satisfy a particular enhanced security requirement and may implement alternative but equally effective security measures to satisfy the intent of the requirement.
- Federal agencies define, in appropriate contracts or other agreements, the organization-defined parameters for applicable enhanced security requirements.

## Defense-in-Depth Protection Strategy
The enhanced security requirements provide the foundation for a multidimensional, defense-in-depth protection strategy that includes three mutually supportive and reinforcing components:

1. Penetration-resistant architecture
2. Damage-limiting operations
3. Designing for cyber resiliency and survivability [SP 800-160-2]

This strategy recognizes that despite the best protection measures implemented by organizations, advanced persistent threats (APTs) may find ways to compromise or breach boundary defenses and deploy malicious code within a defender’s system.

### Safeguards and Countermeasures
When a breach occurs, organizations must have access to safeguards and countermeasures to:

- Detect
- Outmaneuver
- Confuse
- Deceive
- Mislead
- Impede the adversary

This approach aims to remove the adversary’s tactical advantage and protect the organization’s critical programs and high-value assets.

## Implementation of Enhanced Security Requirements
While the enhanced security requirements can be implemented comprehensively, organizations may, as part of their overarching risk management strategy, select a subset of the security requirements. However, there are dependencies among certain requirements that will affect the selection process.

The enhanced security requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in the contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations. Specific implementation guidance for the selected requirements can be provided by federal agencies to nonfederal organizations in such contractual vehicles or agreements.

## Basis of Enhanced Security Requirements
The enhanced security requirements are derived from the security controls in [SP 800-53]. They represent methods for protecting information (and Controlled Unclassified Information, in particular) against cyber-attacks from advanced cyber threats and for ensuring the cyber resiliency of systems and organizations while under attack.

### Focus Areas
The enhanced security requirements focus on the following key areas:

- [Further details to be provided in subsequent sections]# Key Elements for Addressing APT

- Applying a threat-centric approach to security requirements specification.
- Employing system and security architectures that support logical and physical isolation using system and network segmentation techniques, virtual machines, and containers.
- Implementing dual authorization controls for the most critical or sensitive operations.
- Limiting persistent storage to isolated enclaves or domains.
- Implementing a comply-to-connect approach for systems and networks.
- Extending configuration management requirements by establishing authoritative sources for addressing changes to systems and system components.
- Periodically refreshing or upgrading organizational systems and system components to a known state or developing new systems or components.
- Employing a security operations center with advanced analytics to support continuous monitoring and protection of organizational systems.
- Using deception to confuse and mislead adversaries regarding the information they use for decision-making, the value and authenticity of the information they attempt to exfiltrate, or the environment in which they are operating.

## 2.2 Organization and Structure

The enhanced security requirements are organized into 14 families consistent with the families for basic and derived requirements. Each family contains the requirements related to the general security topic of the family. The families are closely aligned with the minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems in [FIPS 200].

The security requirements for contingency planning, system and services acquisition, and planning are not included within the scope of this publication due to the tailoring criteria in [SP 800-171].

### Table 1

Lists the security requirement families addressed in this publication.

The structure of an enhanced security requirement is similar to the basic and derived security requirements in [SP 800-171]. For some requirements, additional flexibility is provided by allowing organizations to define specific values for the designated parameters. Flexibility is achieved using assignment and selection operations embedded within certain requirements.

The assignment and selection operations provide the capability to customize the enhanced security requirements based on organizational protection needs. Determination of organization-defined parameter values can be guided and informed by laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidance, or mission or business needs. Risk assessments and risk tolerance are also important factors in defining the values for requirement parameters.

Once specified, the values for the assignment and selection operations become part of the requirement. Following each enhanced security requirement, a discussion section provides additional information to facilitate the implementation of the requirement. This information is primarily derived from the security controls discussion sections in [SP 800-53] and is provided to give organizations a better understanding of the mechanisms and procedures that can be employed.# Enhanced Security Requirements for Protecting CUI

## Introduction
The discussion section is informational only and is not intended to extend the scope of the enhanced security requirements. It also includes informative references.

## Protection Strategy and Adversary Effects
A protection strategy and adversary effects section describe the potential effects of implementing the enhanced security requirements on risk. This specifically involves:

- Reducing the likelihood of the occurrence of threat events
- Enhancing the ability of threat events to cause harm
- Limiting the extent of that harm

### Desired Effects on the Adversary
Five high-level, desired effects on the adversary can be identified:

1. Redirect
2. Preclude
3. Impede
4. Limit
5. Expose

Each adversary effect is further decomposed to include specific impacts on risk and expected results. These adversary effects are described in [SP 800-160-2] and in Appendix D.

## Assignment and Selection Operations
The parameter values for assignment and selection operations in designated enhanced security requirements are determined by the cognizant federal agency. However, these values should be coordinated with the nonfederal organization. This reflects situations where the parameter values depend on specific characteristics, attributes, or conditions within the nonfederal organization or system (e.g., system architecture, design, or implementation).

### Mapping to Security Controls
Similar to the basic and derived requirements, the enhanced security requirements are mapped to the security controls in [SP 800-53], the source from which the requirements were derived. The mappings, which can be found in tables C-1 through C-14, are provided for informational purposes only, noting that the related controls do not provide additional requirements.

## Flexible Application
The enhanced security requirements are applied, as necessary, to protect CUI associated with a critical program or a high-value asset. Federal agencies may limit application as long as the needed protection is achieved, such as by:

- Applying the enhanced security requirements to the components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI associated with a critical program or high-value asset
- Providing protection for such components
- Addressing direct attack paths to such components (e.g., due to established trust relationships between system components)

### Selection of Enhanced Security Requirements
There is no expectation that all of the enhanced security requirements will be selected by every federal agency. The decision to select enhanced security requirements will be based on the specific mission and business protection needs of the agency, group of agencies, or the federal government (i.e., federal entity) and will be guided and informed by ongoing assessments of risk. The selection of enhanced security requirements for a nonfederal system processing, storing, or transmitting CUI associated with a critical program or a high-value asset will be determined accordingly.# Enhanced Security Requirements for Nonfederal Organizations

## Introduction
The asset will be conveyed to the nonfederal organization by the federal entity in a contract, grant, or other agreement. The application of the enhanced security requirements to subcontractors will also be addressed by the federal entity in consultation with the nonfederal organization.

Certain enhanced security requirements may be too difficult or cost-prohibitive for organizations to meet internally. In these situations, the use of external service providers can be leveraged to satisfy the requirements. The services include but are not limited to:

- Threat intelligence
- Threat and adversary hunting
- System monitoring and security management
- IT infrastructure, platform, and software services
- Threat, vulnerability, and risk assessments
- Response and recovery
- Cyber resiliency

Finally, specific implementation guidance associated with the enhanced security requirements is beyond the scope of this publication. Organizations have maximum flexibility in the methods, techniques, technologies, and approaches used to satisfy the enhanced security requirements.

## Implementation Tips for Federal Agencies
1. Select the set of enhanced security requirements needed to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in the nonfederal system or organization.
2. Complete the assignment and selection operations (where applicable) in the set of enhanced security requirements selected by the agency.
3. Develop implementation guidance for nonfederal organizations if desired or needed.
4. Include the enhanced security requirements and implementation guidance in federal contracts or other agreements with nonfederal organizations.

# Chapter Three: The Requirements

## Enhanced Security Requirements for the Advanced Persistent Threat
This chapter describes enhanced security requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations from the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).

The enhanced security requirements are not required for any particular category or article of CUI. However, if a federal agency determines that CUI is associated with a critical program or a high-value asset, the information and the system processing, storing, or transmitting such information are potential targets for the APT and, therefore, may require enhanced protection.

Such protection, expressed through the enhanced security requirements, is mandated by a federal agency in a contract, grant, or other agreement. The enhanced security requirements are implemented in addition to the basic and derived requirements contained in [SP 800-171] since the basic and derived requirements are not designed to address the APT.

Associated with each enhanced security requirement is an identification of which of the three protection strategy areas (i.e., penetration-resistant architecture, damage-limiting operations, and designing for cyber resiliency and survivability) the requirement supports.# Current Page Raw OCR Text

## Introduction
and what potential effects the requirement has on an adversary. This information is included to assist organizations in ascertaining whether the requirement is appropriate. Ideally, the requirements selected should be balanced across the three strategy areas. Selecting requirements that fall exclusively in one area could result in an unbalanced response strategy for dealing with the APT. Similarly, with regard to potential effects on adversaries, organizations should attempt to have as broad a set of effects on an adversary as possible, given their specific mission or business objectives.

## 3.1 Access Control

### 3.1.1e Employ dual authorization to execute critical or sensitive system and organizational operations.

#### Discussion
Dual authorization, also known as two-person control, reduces risk related to insider threats. Dual authorization requires the approval of two authorized individuals to execute certain commands, actions, or functions. For example, organizations employ dual authorization to help ensure that changes to selected system components (i.e., hardware, software, and firmware) or information cannot occur unless two qualified individuals approve and implement such changes. These individuals possess the skills and expertise to determine if the proposed changes are correct implementations of the approved changes, and they are also accountable for those changes. Another example is employing dual authorization for the execution of privileged commands. To reduce the risk of collusion, organizations consider rotating assigned dual authorization duties to reduce the risk of an insider threat. Dual authorization can be implemented via either technical or procedural measures and can be carried out sequentially or in parallel.

#### Protection Strategy
- Penetration-Resistant Architecture
- Damage-Limiting Operations

#### Adversary Effects
See [SP 800-160-2]: [Preclude (Preempt); Impede (Exert)].

### 3.1.2e Restrict access to systems and system components to only those information resources that are owned, provisioned, or issued by the organization.

#### Discussion
Information resources that are not owned, provisioned, or issued by the organization include systems or system components owned by other organizations and personally owned devices. Non-organizational information resources present significant risks to the organization and complicate the ability to employ a "comply-to-connect" policy or implement component or device attestation techniques to ensure the integrity of the organizational system.

- Penetration-Resistant Architecture

#### Adversary Effects
See [SP 800-160-2]: [Preclude (Preempt); Impede (Contain, Exert)].

### 3.1.3e Employ [Assignment: organization-defined secure information transfer solutions] to control information flows between security domains on connected systems.# Discussion

Organizations employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.

Transferring information between systems in different security domains with different security policies introduces the risk that the transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners or information stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations mandate specific architectural solutions when required to enforce logical or physical separation between systems in different security domains. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security domain or connected system, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and labels.

Secure information transfer solutions often include one or more of the following properties: use of cross-domain solutions when traversing security domains, mutual authentication of the sender and recipient (using hardware-based cryptography), encryption of data in transit and at rest, isolation from other domains, and logging of information transfers (e.g., title of file, file size, cryptographic hash of file, sender, recipient, transfer time and Internet Protocol [IP] address, receipt time, and IP address).

## 3.2 Awareness and Training

### Enhanced Security Requirements

3.2.1e Provide awareness training [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] focused on recognizing and responding to threats from social engineering, advanced persistent threat actors, breaches, and suspicious behaviors; update the training [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or when there are significant changes to the threat.

## Discussion

An effective method to detect APT activities and reduce the effectiveness of those activities is to provide specific awareness training for individuals. A well-trained and...# Security-Aware Workforce

The security-aware workforce provides another organizational safeguard that can be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect organizations against malicious code injections via email or web applications.

## Threat Awareness Training

Threat awareness training includes educating individuals on the various ways that Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) can infiltrate organizations, including through:

- Websites
- Emails
- Advertisement pop-ups
- Articles
- Social engineering

Training can include techniques for recognizing suspicious emails, the use of removable systems in non-secure settings, and the potential targeting of individuals by adversaries outside the workplace. Awareness training is assessed and updated periodically to ensure that the training is relevant and effective, particularly with respect to the threat since it is constantly, and often rapidly, evolving.

**Reference:** [SP 800-50] provides guidance on security awareness and training programs.

## Protection Strategy

### Damage-Limiting Operations

### Adversary Effects

See [SP 800-160-2]: [Impede (Exert); Expose (Detect)].

### Practical Exercises

Include practical exercises in awareness training for **[Assignment: organization-defined roles]** that are aligned with current threat scenarios and provide feedback to individuals involved in the training and their supervisors.

## Discussion

Awareness training is most effective when it is complemented by practical exercises tailored to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of the threat. Examples of practical exercises include:

- Unannounced social engineering attempts to gain unauthorized access
- Collecting information
- Simulating the adverse impact of opening malicious email attachments or invoking, via spear phishing attacks, malicious web links

Rapid feedback is essential to reinforce desired user behavior. Training results, especially failures of personnel in critical roles, can be indicative of a potentially serious problem. It is important that senior management is made aware of such situations so that they can take appropriate remediating actions.

## Audit and Accountability

### Enhanced Security Requirements

There are no enhanced security requirements for audit and accountability.

## Configuration Management

### Enhanced Security Requirements

#### 3.4.1e

Establish and maintain an authoritative source and repository to provide a trusted source and accountability for approved and implemented system components.

### Discussion

The establishment and maintenance of an authoritative source and repository includes a system component inventory of approved hardware, software, and firmware; approved system baseline.# Configuration Management and Integrity Controls

## Overview
Configurations and configuration changes are critical for maintaining system integrity. This includes verifying system software, firmware, images, and scripts. The authoritative source implements integrity controls to log changes or attempts to change software, configurations, or data in the repository.

## Change Management Procedures
Changes to the repository are subject to change management procedures and require user authentication for any requested changes. In certain situations, organizations may also require dual authorization for such changes.

## Integrity and Authenticity Checks
Software changes are routinely checked for integrity and authenticity to ensure that updates to the repository are legitimate. This process is essential when refreshing a system from a known, trusted source.

## Compliance and Deviation Monitoring
The information in the repository is used to demonstrate adherence to or identify deviations from established configuration baselines. It also aids in restoring system components from a trusted source.

### Desired State vs. Actual State
From an automated assessment perspective, the system description provided by the authoritative source is referred to as the **desired state**. The desired state is compared to the actual state to check for compliance or deviations.

## Guidance References

- Remove the components
- Place the components in a quarantine or remediation network to facilitate patching, re-configuration, or other mitigations.

# Discussion
System components that process, store, transmit, or protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) are monitored and checked against the authoritative source, which includes hardware and software inventory and associated baseline configurations.

## Compliance Checking
Using automated tools, the desired state is compared to the actual state to check for compliance or deviations. Security responses to system components that are unknown or deviate from approved configurations can include:
- Removing the components
- Halting system functions or processing
- Placing the system components in a quarantine or remediation network
- Issuing alerts and/or notifications to personnel regarding unauthorized modifications of organization-defined configuration items.

Responses can be automated, manual, or procedural. Components that are removed from the system are rebuilt from a trusted source.# Trusted Configuration Baseline

Employ automated discovery and management tools to maintain an up-to-date, complete, accurate, and readily available inventory of system components.

### Discussion
The system component inventory includes system-specific information required for component accountability and to provide support to identify, control, monitor, and verify configuration items in accordance with the authoritative source. The information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes:

- System name
- Hardware and software component owners
- Hardware inventory specifications
- Software license information
- Software version numbers
- For networked components: machine names and network addresses

Inventory specifications include:

- Manufacturer
- Supplier information
- Component type
- Date of receipt
- Cost
- Model
- Serial number
- Physical location

Organizations also use automated mechanisms to implement and maintain authoritative (i.e., up-to-date, complete, accurate, and available) baseline configurations for systems that include hardware and software inventory tools, configuration management tools, and network management tools. Tools can be used to track version numbers on operating systems, applications, types of software installed, and current patch levels.

## Identification and Authentication
### Enhanced Security Requirements
#### 3.5.1e
Identify and authenticate [Assignment: organization-defined systems and system components] before establishing a network connection using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based and replay resistant.

### Discussion
Cryptographically-based and replay-resistant authentication between systems, components, and devices addresses the risk of unauthorized access from spoofing (i.e., claiming a false identity). The requirement applies to:

- Client-server authentication
- Server-server authentication
- Device authentication (including mobile devices)

The cryptographic key for authentication transactions is stored in suitably secure storage available to the authenticator application (e.g., keychain storage, Trusted Platform Module [TPM], Trusted Execution Environment [TEE], or secure element). Mandating authentication requirements at every connection point may not be practical, and therefore, such requirements may only be applied periodically or at the initial connection.# Point of Network Connection

### 3.5.2e
Employ automated mechanisms for the generation, protection, rotation, and management of passwords for systems and system components that do not support multifactor authentication or complex account management.

#### Discussion
In situations where static passwords or personal identification numbers (PIN) are used (e.g., certain system components do not support multifactor authentication or complex account management, such as separate system accounts for each user and logging), automated mechanisms (e.g., password managers) can automatically generate, rotate, manage, and store strong and different passwords for users and device accounts.

For example, a router might have one administrator account, but an organization typically has multiple network administrators. Therefore, access management and accountability are problematic. A password manager uses techniques such as automated password rotation (in this example, for the router password) to allow a specific user to temporarily gain access to a device by checking out a temporary password and then checking the password back in to end the access. The password manager simultaneously logs these actions.

One of the risks in using password managers is that an adversary may target the collection of passwords that the device generates. Therefore, it is important that these passwords are secured. Methods for protecting passwords include the use of multi-factor authentication to the password manager, encryption, or secured hardware (e.g., a hardware security module).

[SP 800-63-3] provides guidance on password generation and management.

### 3.5.3e
Employ automated or manual/procedural mechanisms to prohibit system components from connecting to organizational systems unless the components are known, authenticated, in a properly configured state, or in a trust profile.

#### Discussion
Identification and authentication of system components and component configurations can be determined, for example, via a cryptographic hash of the component. This is also known as device attestation and known operating state or trust profile. A trust profile based on factors such as the user, authentication method, device type, and physical location is used to make dynamic decisions on authorizations to data of varying types.

If device attestation is the means of identification and authentication, then it is important that patches and updates to the device are handled via a configuration management process such that the patches and updates are done.# Security Operations and Incident Response

## 3.6 Incident Response

### Enhanced Security Requirements

#### 3.6.1e
Establish and maintain a security operations center capability that operates [Assignment: organization-defined time period].

##### Discussion
A security operations center (SOC) is the focal point for security operations and computer network defense for an organization. The purpose of the SOC is to defend and monitor an organization’s systems and networks (i.e., cyber infrastructure) on an ongoing basis. The SOC is also responsible for detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner.

The SOC is staffed with skilled technical and operational personnel (e.g., security analysts, incident response personnel, systems security engineers); in some instances operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week; and implements technical, management, and operational controls (e.g., monitoring, scanning, and forensics tools) to monitor, fuse, correlate, analyze, and respond to security-relevant event data from multiple sources.

Sources of event data include perimeter defenses, network devices (e.g., gateways, routers, and switches), and endpoint agent data feeds. The SOC provides a holistic situational awareness capability to help organizations determine the security posture of the system and organization. An SOC capability can be obtained in many ways. Larger organizations may implement a dedicated SOC while smaller organizations may employ third-party organizations to provide such a capability.

##### Discussion
A cyber incident response team (CIRT) is a team of experts that assesses, documents, and responds to cyber incidents so that organizational systems can recover quickly and implement the necessary controls to avoid future incidents. CIRT personnel include, for example, forensic analysts, malicious code analysts, systems security engineers, and real-time operations personnel.

The incident handling capability includes performing rapid forensic preservation of evidence.# Incident Response and Protection Strategies

## Incident Response Team (CIRT)

The Incident Response Team (CIRT) is responsible for the analysis of and response to intrusions. Team members may or may not be full-time but need to be available to respond within the required time period. The size and specialties of the team are based on known and anticipated threats.

The team is typically pre-equipped with the necessary software and hardware (e.g., forensic tools) for rapid identification, quarantine, mitigation, and recovery. They are also familiar with how to preserve evidence and maintain the chain of custody for law enforcement or counterintelligence uses.

For some organizations, the CIRT can be implemented as a cross-organizational entity or as part of the Security Operations Center (SOC).

#### Personnel Screening
Conduct [Assignment: organization-defined enhanced personnel screening] for individuals and reassess individual positions and access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

### Discussion
Personnel security is the discipline that provides a trusted workforce based on an evaluation or assessment of conduct, integrity, judgment, loyalty, reliability, and stability. The extent of the vetting is commensurate with the level of risk that individuals could bring about by their position and access to CUI.

For individuals accessing Federal Government facilities and systems, the Federal Government employs resources, information, and technology in its vetting processes to ensure a trusted workforce. These screening processes may be extended, in whole or in part, to persons accessing federal information, including CUI that is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations through contractual vehicles or other agreements established between federal agencies and nonfederal organizations.

### Examples of Enhanced Personnel Screening
Examples of enhanced personnel screening for security purposes include additional background checks. Personnel reassessment activities reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, and specific criteria established for the level of access required for assigned positions.

Employ [Assignment: organization-defined sources of threat intelligence] as part of a risk assessment to guide and inform the development of organizational systems, security architectures, selection of security solutions, monitoring, threat hunting, and response and recovery activities.

## Discussion
The constant evolution and increased sophistication of adversaries, especially the APT, makes it more likely that adversaries can successfully compromise or breach organizational systems. Accordingly, threat intelligence can be integrated into each step of the risk management process throughout the system development life cycle. This risk management process includes defining system security requirements, developing system and security architectures, selecting security solutions, monitoring (including threat hunting), and remediation efforts. [SP 800-30] provides guidance on risk assessments. [SP 800-39] provides guidance on the risk management process.

##### 3.11.2e
Conduct cyber threat hunting activities [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; [Assignment: organization-defined event]] to search for indicators of compromise in [Assignment: organization-defined systems] and detect, track, and disrupt threats that evade existing controls.

## Discussion
Threat hunting is an active means of defense that contrasts with traditional protection measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, quarantining malicious code in sandboxes, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technologies.# Cyber Threat Hunting

Cyber threat hunting involves proactively searching organizational systems, networks, and infrastructure for advanced threats. The objective is to track and disrupt cyber adversaries as early as possible in the attack sequence and to measurably improve the speed and accuracy of organizational responses.

## Indicators of Compromise

Indicators of compromise are forensic artifacts from intrusions that are identified on organizational systems at the host or network level. They can include:
- Unusual network traffic
- Unusual file changes
- The presence of malicious code

## Threat Hunting Teams

Threat hunting teams use existing threat intelligence and may create new threat information, which may be shared with:
- Peer organizations
- Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAO)
- Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC)
- Relevant government departments and agencies

Threat indicators, signatures, tactics, techniques, procedures, and other indicators of compromise may be available via government and non-government cooperatives, including:
- Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams
- United States Computer Emergency Response Team
- Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Information Sharing Program
- CERT Coordination Center

### Documentation

Document or reference in the system security plan the security solution selected, the rationale for the security solution, and the risk determination.# System Security Plans

System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and solutions. The plans describe how the controls and solutions meet the security requirements. For the enhanced security requirements selected when the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a concern, the security plan provides traceability between threat and risk assessments and the risk-based selection of a security solution, including discussion of relevant analyses of alternatives and rationale for key security-relevant architectural and design decisions. This level of detail is important as the threat changes, requiring reassessment of the risk and the basis for previous security decisions.

## Incorporating External Service Providers

When incorporating external service providers into the system security plan, organizations state:
- The type of service provided (e.g., software as a service, platform as a service)
- The point and type of connections (including ports and protocols)
- The nature and type of the information flows to and from the service provider
- The security controls implemented by the service provider

For safety-critical systems, organizations document situations for which safety is the primary reason for not implementing a security solution (i.e., the solution is appropriate to address the threat but causes a safety concern).

- Disruption
- Use of defective components
- Insertion of counterfeits
- Theft
- Malicious development practices
- Improper delivery practices
- Insertion of malicious code

These events can have a significant impact on a system and its information.# Supply Chain Risk Management

## Introduction
Supply chain-related events can adversely impact organizational operations, including mission, functions, image, or reputation, as well as organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. These events may be unintentional or malicious and can occur at any point during the system life cycle.

## Risk Analysis
An analysis of supply chain risk can help an organization identify systems or components for which additional supply chain risk mitigations are required.

## Supply Chain Risk Management Plan
### Action Item
- Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with organizational systems and system components; update the plan at an organization-defined frequency.

## Discussion
The growing dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, along with the nature of the relationships with those providers, presents an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions that may increase risk include:
- Insertion or use of counterfeits
- Unauthorized production
- Tampering
- Theft
- Insertion of malicious software and hardware
- Poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain

Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with both internal and external stakeholders.

### Supply Chain Risk Management Activities
SCRM activities involve:
- Identifying and assessing risks
- Determining appropriate mitigating actions
- Developing SCRM plans to document selected mitigating actions
- Monitoring performance against plans

SCRM plans address requirements for developing trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and system components, including the application of the security design principles implemented as part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes.

## Security Assessment
### Enhanced Security Requirements
#### Action Item
- Conduct penetration testing at an organization-defined frequency, leveraging automated scanning tools and ad hoc tests using subject matter experts.

## Discussion
Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. It goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by penetration testing agents.# Penetration Testing and Security Assessments

## Overview
Teams with particular skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating system, and application-level security are essential for effective penetration testing. This process can validate vulnerabilities or determine a system’s penetration resistance to adversaries within specified constraints, such as time, resources, and skills.

## Red Team Exercises
Organizations may supplement penetration testing with red team exercises. Red teams attempt to replicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out attacks against organizations, providing an in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses or deficiencies.

## Vulnerability Analyses
Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware, software, or firmware components of a system, exercising both physical and technical controls.

## Standard Method for Penetration Testing
A standard method for penetration testing includes:
1. **Pretest Analysis**: Based on full knowledge of the system.
2. **Pretest Identification**: Identifying potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest analysis.
3. **Testing**: Designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities.

All parties agree to the specified rules of engagement before the commencement of penetration testing. Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for penetration tests and red teaming exercises (if used) with the tools, techniques, and procedures that they anticipate adversaries may employ.

## Team Skills and Objectivity
The penetration testing or red team exercises may be organization-based or external to the organization. In either case, it is important that the team possesses the necessary skills and resources to do the job and is objective in its assessment.

### Enhanced Security Requirements
#### 3.13.1e
Create diversity in [Assignment: organization-defined system components] to reduce the extent of malicious code propagation.

### Discussion
Organizations often use homogenous information technology environments to reduce costs and simplify administration and use. However, a homogenous environment can also facilitate the work of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), as it allows for common mode failures and the propagation of malicious code across identical system components (i.e., hardware, software, and firmware).

In these environments, adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) that work on one instantiation of a system component will work equally well on other identical instantiations of the component, regardless of how many times such components are replicated or how far away they may be placed in the architecture. Increasing diversity within organizational systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations or compromises of specific technologies.# Protecting Against Common Mode Failures

## Introduction
Protecting against common mode failures, including those induced by supply chain attacks, is crucial for maintaining system integrity.

## Importance of Diversity
Diversity in system components reduces the likelihood that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) used by adversaries to compromise one system component will be effective against others. This increases the adversary's work factor, making it more challenging to successfully complete planned attacks.

### Heterogeneous Environments
A heterogeneous or diverse information technology environment complicates the propagation of malicious code, as adversaries must develop and deploy different TTPs for various components.

## Implementing Diversity
Satisfying the requirement for diversity does not necessitate the acquisition and management of multiple versions of operating systems, applications, tools, and communication protocols. However, employing diversity in critical, organizationally determined system components can serve as an effective countermeasure against advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### Existing Practices
Organizations may already practice diversity, albeit not specifically to counter APTs. For instance:
- **Diverse Anti-Virus Products**: Organizations often use different anti-virus products across their infrastructure because each vendor may issue updates to new malicious code patterns at varying times and frequencies.
- **Vendor Variation**: Some organizations utilize products from one vendor at the server level and another at the end-user level.
- **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**: Products that provide ASLR introduce synthetic diversity by transforming common software implementations to create various instances.
- **Multiple VPN Vendors**: Organizations may opt to use multiple virtual private network (VPN) vendors, tunneling one vendor’s VPN within another’s.

### Challenges for Smaller Organizations
Smaller organizations may find achieving diversity in system components challenging and potentially impractical. They must also consider the vulnerabilities that may arise from employing diverse system components.

## Implementation Changes
### Organizational Changes
Implement the following changes to organizational systems and system components to introduce unpredictability into operations:
- **Assignment**: Organization-defined changes and frequency of changes by system and system component.

## Discussion
Cyber-attacks by adversaries are based on the assumption of a certain degree of predictability and consistency regarding the attack surface. The attack surface is defined as the set of points on the system that are vulnerable to attack.# Cybersecurity Strategies

## Understanding Attack Surfaces

The attack surface of a system, system element, or environment is where an attacker can attempt to enter, cause an effect on, or extract data. Changes to the attack surface can reduce the predictability of the environment, making it difficult for adversaries to plan and execute attacks. This unpredictability can lead to miscalculations that may impact the overall effectiveness of the attacks or increase the observability of the attackers.

### Achieving Unpredictability

Unpredictability can be achieved by making changes at seemingly random times or under various circumstances. For example, randomly shortening the time when credentials are valid can introduce increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries regarding the actions organizations take to defend their systems. Such actions may hinder adversaries' ability to correctly target system components that support critical or essential organizational missions or business functions.

Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to hesitate before initiating or continuing attacks. Techniques involving randomness include:
- Performing routine actions at different times of day
- Employing different information technologies
- Using different suppliers
- Rotating the roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel

### Confusing and Misleading Adversaries

Employ [Assignment: organization-defined technical and procedural means] to confuse and mislead adversaries.

## Discussion

There are various techniques and approaches that can be utilized to confuse and mislead adversaries, including:
- Misdirection
- Tainting
- Disinformation
- A combination of these methods

### Deception Techniques

Deception is employed to confuse and mislead adversaries regarding:
- The information they use for decision-making
- The value and authenticity of the information they attempt to exfiltrate
- The environment in which they desire or need to operate

Such actions can impede the adversary's ability to conduct meaningful reconnaissance of the targeted organization, delay or degrade their ability to move laterally through a system, divert them away from systems containing Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), and increase the observability of the adversary to defenders, revealing their presence along with their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

#### Misdirection Techniques

Misdirection can be achieved through deception environments (e.g., deception nets), which provide virtual sandboxes into which malicious code can be diverted, allowing for safe examination of adversary TTPs.

#### Tainting Techniques

Tainting involves embedding data or information in an organizational system or component that the organization wants adversaries to exfiltrate. This allows organizations to determine if information has been exfiltrated or improperly removed and potentially provides insights into the adversary's actions.# Cyber Resiliency and Disinformation Strategies

## Nature of Exfiltration and Adversary Locations

Disinformation can be achieved by making false information intentionally available to adversaries regarding the state of the system or type of organizational defenses. Any disinformation activity is coordinated with the associated federal agency requiring such activity and should include a plan to limit incidental exposure of the false Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) to authorized users.

Disinformation can be employed both tactically (e.g., making available false credentials that the defender can use to track adversary actions) and strategically (e.g., interspersing false CUI with actual CUI, interfering with an adversary’s re-use, reverse engineering, and exploitation of legitimate CUI, thus undermining the adversary’s confidence in the value of the exfiltrated information, and subsequently causing them to limit such exfiltration).

### Employing Isolation Techniques

Employ the following selection of organization-defined isolation techniques in organizational systems and system components:
- **Physical Isolation Techniques**
- **Logical Isolation Techniques**

## Discussion

A mix of physical and logical isolation techniques (described below) implemented as part of the system architecture can limit the unauthorized flow of CUI, reduce the system attack surface, constrain the number of system components that must be secure, and impede the movement of an adversary.

When implemented with a set of managed interfaces, physical and logical isolation techniques for organizational systems and components can isolate CUI into separate security domains where additional protections can be implemented. Any communications across the managed interfaces (i.e., across security domains), including for management or administrative purposes, constitutes remote access even if the communications remain within the organization.

Separating system components with boundary protection mechanisms allows for the increased protection of individual components and more effective control of information flows between those components. This enhanced protection limits the potential harm from and susceptibility to hostile cyber-attacks and errors.

The degree of isolation can vary depending on the boundary protection mechanisms selected. Boundary protection mechanisms include:
- Routers
- Gateways
- Firewalls separating system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks
- Virtualization and micro-virtualization techniques
- Encrypting information flows among system components using distinct encryption keys
- Cross-domain devices separating system components# Subnetwork Isolation Techniques

## System Architectures
System architectures include logical isolation, partial physical and logical isolation, or complete physical isolation between subsystems and at system boundaries between resources that store, process, transmit, or protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and other resources.

### Examples of Isolation Techniques

#### Logical Isolation
- **Data Tagging**: Utilizes digital rights management (DRM) and data loss prevention (DLP) to tag, monitor, and restrict the flow of CUI.
- **Virtual Machines or Containers**: Separate CUI and other information on hosts.
- **Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN)**: Keep CUI and other information separate on networks.

#### Partial Physical and Logical Isolation
- **Isolated Networks**: Physically or cryptographically isolated networks.
- **Dedicated Hardware**: Hardware in data centers that may not directly access resources outside of the domain.
- **Secure Clients**: Clients that access via remote virtualized applications or virtual desktops with no file transfer capability other than with dual authorization, or employ dedicated client hardware (e.g., zero or thin clients) or hardware approved for multi-level secure (MLS) usage.

#### Complete Physical Isolation
- **Dedicated Hardware**: Not shared client and server hardware.
- **Stand-Alone Enclaves**: Physically isolated enclaves for clients and servers.
- **Logically Separate Network Traffic**: Using a VLAN with end-to-end encryption using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based cryptography or physical isolation from other networks.

## Risk Management Perspective
Isolation techniques are selected based on a risk management perspective that balances the threat, the information being protected, and the cost of the options for protection. Architectural and design decisions are guided and informed by the security requirements and selected solutions. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of the isolation techniques employed, as logical isolation relies on information technology that could be considered a high-value target due to the function being performed, introducing its own set of vulnerabilities.

## System Functions or Resources
3.13.5e Distribute and relocate the following system functions or resources [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]: [Assignment: organization-defined system functions or resources].

# Discussion
Changing processing and storage locations (also referred to as moving target defense) addresses the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) by using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This enables organizations to relocate system components that support critical functions.# Missions and Business Functions

Changing the locations of processing activities or storage sites introduces a degree of uncertainty into the targeting activities of adversaries. Targeting uncertainty increases the work factor of adversaries, making compromises or breaches to organizational systems more difficult and time-consuming. It also increases the chances that adversaries may inadvertently disclose aspects of their tradecraft while attempting to locate organizational resources.

## Moving Target Defense

Other options for employing moving target defense include changing IP addresses, Domain Name System (DNS) names, or network topologies. Moving target defense can also increase the work factor for defenders who have a constantly changing system to defend. Accordingly, organizations update their management and security tools and train personnel to adapt to the additional work factor.

## Fragmentation

Another way of addressing this requirement is by fragmentation. This involves taking information and fragmenting/partitioning it across multiple components (e.g., across a distributed database). Such actions mean that the compromise (unauthorized exfiltration) of any single component of the information data set will not result in the compromise of the entire data. To fully compromise the entire data set, the adversary would have to work harder to try to locate all of the data sets.

## System and Information Integrity

### Enhanced Security Requirements

#### 3.14.1e

Verify the integrity of [Assignment: organization-defined security critical or essential software] using root of trust mechanisms or cryptographic signatures.

### Discussion

Verifying the integrity of the organization’s security-critical or essential software is an important capability since corrupted software is the primary attack vector used by adversaries to undermine or disrupt the proper functioning of organizational systems. There are many ways to verify software integrity throughout the system development life cycle.

Root of trust mechanisms (e.g., secure boot, trusted platform modules, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface [UEFI]) verify that only trusted code is executed during boot processes. This capability helps system components protect the integrity of boot firmware in organizational systems by verifying the integrity and authenticity of updates to the firmware prior to applying changes to the system component and preventing unauthorized processes from modifying the boot firmware.

The employment of cryptographic signatures ensures the integrity and authenticity of critical and essential software that stores, processes, or transmits Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Cryptographic signatures include digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the integrity of the software.# Confidentiality and Security Standards

## Key Management
- Confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash.
- Using the public key to verify the hash information.

## Hardware Roots of Trust
- Hardware roots of trust are considered to be more secure.
- This requirement supports sections 3.4.1e and 3.4.3.e.

## Relevant Standards
- **[FIPS 140-3]**: Security requirements for cryptographic modules.
- **[FIPS 180-4]** and **[FIPS 202]**: Secure hash standards.
- **[FIPS 186-4]**: Digital signature standard.
- **[SP 800-147]**: BIOS protection guidance.

## Ongoing Monitoring
### 3.14.2e
- Monitor organizational systems and system components on an ongoing basis for anomalous or suspicious behavior.

## Discussion
- Monitoring is used to identify unusual, suspicious, or unauthorized activities or conditions related to organizational systems and system components.
- Such activities or conditions can include:
- Unusual internal systems communications traffic.
- Unauthorized exporting of information.
- Signaling to external systems.
- Large file transfers.
- Long-time persistent connections.
- Attempts to access information from unexpected locations.
- Unusual protocols and ports in use.
- Attempted communications with suspected malicious external addresses.

- The correlation of physical, time, or geolocation audit record information to the audit records from systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of anomalous behavior.
- For example, the correlation of an individual’s identity for logical access to certain systems with the additional information that the individual was not present at the facility when the logical access occurred is indicative of anomalous behavior.

### 3.14.3e
- Ensure that [Assignment: organization-defined systems and system components] are included in the scope of the specified enhanced security requirements or are segregated in purpose-specific networks.

## Discussion
- Organizations may have a variety of systems and system components in their inventory, including:
- Information Technology (IT)
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Operational Technology (OT)
- Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)

- The convergence of IT, OT, IoT, and IIoT significantly increases the attack surface of organizations and provides attack vectors that are challenging to address.
- Compromised IoT, OT, and IIoT system components can serve as launching points for attacks on organizational systems.# Organizational IT Systems Handling CUI

## Overview
Organizational IT systems that handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) include various components of IoT, OT, and IIoT systems. These components can store, transmit, or process CUI, such as specifications or parameters for objects manufactured in support of critical programs.

## Security Concerns
Most current generation IoT, OT, and IIoT system components are not designed with security as a foundational property. They may lack the ability to be configured for security functionality. Key issues include:

- **Unencrypted Connections**: Connections to and from these system components are generally not encrypted.
- **Lack of Authentication**: They do not provide the necessary authentication.
- **Insufficient Monitoring and Logging**: These components are not monitored and do not log activities.

Due to these vulnerabilities, these components pose a significant cyber threat.

## Mitigation Strategies
Gaps in IoT, OT, and IIoT security capabilities can be addressed by employing intermediary system components that provide:

- **Encryption**
- **Authentication**
- **Security Scanning**
- **Logging Capabilities**

These measures can help prevent components from being accessible from the Internet. However, such mitigation options are not always available or practicable.

### Essential Missions and Business Functions
Some IoT, OT, and IIoT devices may be critical for essential missions and business functions. In these cases, it is necessary to isolate such devices from the Internet to reduce susceptibility to cyber-attacks.

## Refreshing Systems
### Requirement
3.14.4e: Refresh [Assignment: organization-defined systems and system components] from a known, trusted state [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

## Discussion
This requirement mitigates risk from Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) by reducing the targeting capability of adversaries, effectively minimizing the window of opportunity for attacks.

### Non-Persistence Concept
By implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components, organizations can provide a known state computing resource for a specific time period. This approach does not give adversaries sufficient time to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems and their environments.

Given that APTs are sophisticated threats regarding capability, intent, and targeting, organizations must assume that over an extended period, a percentage of attacks will be successful.

### Implementation of Non-Persistence
Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required using protected information and are terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. This increases the work factor for adversaries attempting to compromise or breach systems.

Non-persistence can be achieved by:

- Periodically reimaging components
- Utilizing various common virtualization techniques

Non-persistent services can also be implemented using "Infrastructure as Code" to automatically build, configure, test, deploy, and manage system components.# System Component Management

## Overview
Manage containers, virtual machines, or new instances of processes on physical machines (both persistent or non-persistent). Periodic refreshes of system components and services do not require organizations to determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that may often be difficult to determine).

## Refresh Strategy
The refresh of selected system components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks but not with such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities.

## Reimaging of System Components
The reimaging of system components includes:
- The reinstallation of firmware, operating systems, and applications from a known, trusted source.
- The installation of patches.
- The reapplication of configuration settings.
- The refresh of system or application data from a known, trusted source.

## Persistent Organizational Storage Reviews
### 3.14.5e
Conduct reviews of persistent organizational storage locations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and remove Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) that is no longer needed.

### Discussion
As programs, projects, and contracts evolve, some CUI may no longer be needed. Periodic and event-related (e.g., at project completion) reviews are conducted to ensure that CUI that is no longer required is securely removed from persistent storage.

Removal is consistent with federal records retention policies and disposition schedules. Retaining information for longer than it is needed makes the information a potential target for adversaries searching for critical program or High-Value Asset (HVA) information to exfiltrate.

The unnecessary retention of system-related information provides adversaries information that can assist in their reconnaissance and lateral movement through organizational systems. Alternatively, information which must be retained but is not required for current activities is removed from online storage and stored offline in a secure location to eliminate the possibility of individuals gaining unauthorized access to the information through a network.

The purging of CUI renders the information unreadable, indecipherable, and unrecoverable. [SP 800-88] provides guidance on media sanitization.

## Threat Indicator Information
### 3.14.6e
Use threat indicator information and effective mitigations obtained from [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] to guide and inform intrusion responses.# Detection and Threat Hunting

## Discussion
Threat information related to specific threat events (e.g., TTPs, targets) that organizations have experienced, threat mitigations that organizations have found to be effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that can occur) are sourced from and shared with trusted organizations. This threat information can be used by organizational Security Operations Centers (SOC) and incorporated into monitoring capabilities.

Threat information sharing includes threat indicators, signatures, and adversary TTPs from organizations participating in threat-sharing consortia, government-commercial cooperatives, and government-government cooperatives (e.g., CERTCC, CISA/US-CERT, FIRST, ISAO, DIB CS Program). Unclassified indicators, based on classified information but which can be readily incorporated into organizational intrusion detection systems, are available to qualified nonfederal organizations from government sources.

### Verification of Security Components
3.14.7e Verify the correctness of [Assignment: organization-defined security critical or essential software, firmware, and hardware components] using [Assignment: organization-defined verification methods or techniques].

## Discussion
Verification methods have varying degrees of rigor in determining the correctness of software, firmware, and hardware components. For example, formal verification involves proving that a software program satisfies some formal property or set of properties. The nature of formal verification is generally time-consuming and not employed for commercial operating systems and applications. Therefore, it would likely only be applied to some very limited uses, such as verifying cryptographic protocols. However, in cases where software, firmware, or hardware components exist with formal verification of the component’s security properties, such components provide greater assurance and trustworthiness and are preferred over similar components that have not been formally verified.

[SP 800-160-1] provides guidance on developing trustworthy, secure, and cyber resilient systems using systems security engineering practices and security design concepts.
