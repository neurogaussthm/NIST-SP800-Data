# Executive Summary

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) virtual private networks (VPN) provide secure remote access to an organization’s resources. A VPN is a virtual network, built on top of existing physical networks, that can provide a secure communications mechanism for data and other information transmitted between two endpoints. Because a VPN can be used over existing networks such as the Internet, it can facilitate the secure transfer of sensitive data across public networks.

An SSL VPN consists of one or more VPN devices to which users connect using their Web browsers. The traffic between the Web browser and the SSL VPN device is encrypted with the SSL protocol or its successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This type of VPN may be referred to as either an SSL VPN or a TLS VPN. This guide uses the term SSL VPN.

SSL VPNs provide remote users with access to Web applications and client/server applications, and connectivity to internal networks. Despite the popularity of SSL VPNs, they are not intended to replace Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) VPNs. The two VPN technologies are complementary and address separate network architectures and business needs.

SSL VPNs offer versatility and ease of use because they use the SSL protocol, which is included with all standard Web browsers, so the client usually does not require configuration by the user. SSL VPNs offer granular control for a range of users on a variety of computers, accessing resources from many locations.

## Types of SSL VPNs

There are two primary types of SSL VPNs:

### SSL Portal VPNs

This type of SSL VPN allows a user to use a single standard SSL connection to a Web site to securely access multiple network services. The site accessed is typically called a portal because it is a single page that leads to many other resources. The remote user accesses the SSL VPN gateway using any modern Web browser, identifies himself or herself to the gateway using an authentication method supported by the gateway, and is then presented with a Web page that acts as the portal to the other services.

### SSL Tunnel VPNs

This type of SSL VPN allows a user to use a typical Web browser to securely access multiple network services, including applications and protocols that are not web-based, through a tunnel that is running under SSL. SSL tunnel VPNs require that the Web browser be able to handle active content, which allows them to provide functionality that is not accessible to SSL portal VPNs. Examples of active content include Java, JavaScript, Active X, or Flash applications or plug-ins.

## Conclusion

This publication discusses the fundamental technologies and features of SSL VPNs. It describes SSL and how it fits within the context of layered network security. It presents a phased approach to SSL VPN planning and implementation that can help in achieving successful SSL VPN deployments. It also compares the SSL VPN technology with IPsec VPNs and other VPN solutions. This information is particularly valuable for helping organizations to determine how best to deploy SSL VPNs within their infrastructure.# Recommendations for SSL VPN Use in Federal Agencies

Implementing the following recommendations should assist in facilitating more efficient and effective SSL VPN use for Federal departments and agencies.

## FIPS Compliance

Federal agencies deploying SSL VPNs must configure them to only allow FIPS-compliant cryptographic algorithms, cipher suites, and versions of SSL. Some organizations, such as Federal agencies, have strict requirements for encryption and integrity protection.

### Cryptographic Requirements

SSL VPNs should support the required algorithms for symmetric encryption, key exchange, and hash functions. For government agencies, traffic that requires protection must employ Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)-compliant cryptographic algorithms and modules.

Many of the cryptographic algorithms used in some SSL cipher suites are not FIPS-approved, and therefore are not allowed for use in SSL VPNs that are to be used in applications that must conform to FIPS 140-2. This means that to be run in FIPS-compliant mode, an SSL VPN gateway must only allow cipher suites that are allowed by FIPS 140-2.

### Changes in Cryptographic Requirements

Some of the cryptographic requirements, including allowable hash functions and certificate key lengths, will change at the end of 2010. Therefore, Federal agencies who want to provide SSL VPN services after 2010 must ensure that their systems are upgradeable to the new FIPS-compliant cipher suites and key lengths before the end of 2010, and that their SSL VPN vendors guarantee that such upgrades will be available early enough for testing and deployment in the field.

## Planning SSL VPN Deployments

Organizations planning SSL VPN deployments should identify and define requirements, and evaluate several products to determine their fit into the organization. SSL VPN products vary in functionality, including protocol and application support. They also vary in breadth, depth, and completeness of features and security services.

### Recommendations and Considerations

Some recommendations and considerations include the following:

- **Manageability Features**: SSL VPN manageability features such as status reporting, logging, and auditing should provide adequate capabilities for the organization to effectively operate and manage the SSL VPN and to extract detailed usage information.

- **High Availability and Scalability**: The SSL VPN high availability and scalability features should support the organization’s requirements for failover, load balancing, and throughput. State and information sharing is recommended to keep the failover process transparent to the user.

- **Portal Customization**: SSL VPN portal customization should allow the organization to control the look and feel of the portal and to customize the portal to support various devices such as personal digital assistants (PDA) and smartphones.

- **Authentication Support**: SSL VPN authentication should provide the necessary support for the organization’s current and future authentication methods and leverage existing authentication databases. SSL VPN authentication should also be tested to ensure interoperability with existing authentication methods.

- **Cryptographic Algorithms**: The strongest possible cryptographic algorithms and key lengths that are considered secure for current practice should be used for encryption and integrity protection unless they are incompatible with existing systems.# SSL VPN Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the key considerations for implementing SSL VPNs, focusing on interoperability, performance, and export constraints.

## Access Controls
- SSL VPNs should be evaluated to ensure they provide the level of granularity needed for access controls.
- Access controls should be capable of applying permissions to users, groups, and resources, as well as integrating with endpoint security controls.

## Endpoint Security
- Implementation of endpoint security controls is often the most diverse service among SSL VPN products.
- Endpoint security should be evaluated to ensure it provides the necessary host integrity checking and security protection mechanisms required for the organization.

## Intrusion Prevention
- Not all SSL VPNs have integrated intrusion prevention capabilities.
- Those that do should be evaluated to ensure they do not introduce an unacceptable amount of latency into the network traffic.

## Phased Approach to SSL VPN Planning and Implementation
Organizations should use a phased approach to SSL VPN planning and implementation. A successful SSL VPN deployment can be achieved by following a clear, step-by-step planning and implementation process. The five phases of the recommended approach are as follows:

1. **Identify Requirements**: Identify the requirements for remote access and determine how they can best be met.
2. **Design the Solution**: Make design decisions in five areas: access control, endpoint security, authentication methods, architecture, and cryptography policy.
3. **Implement and Test a Prototype**: Test a prototype of the designed solution in a laboratory, test, or production environment to identify any potential issues.
4. **Deploy the Solution**: Gradually deploy the SSL VPN solution throughout the enterprise, beginning with a pilot program.
5. **Manage the Solution**: Maintain the SSL VPN components and resolve operational issues. Repeat the planning and implementation process when significant changes need to be incorporated into the solution.

## Limitations of SSL VPN Technology
Organizations should be familiar with the limitations of SSL VPN technology. Although a maturing technology, SSL VPNs continue to face several challenges, including:
- Limitations on their ability to support a large number of applications and clients.
- Methods of implementing network extension and endpoint security.
- Ability to provide clientless access.
- Use of the SSL VPN from public locations.
- Product and technology education.

## Supporting Measures for SSL VPN Implementations
Organizations should implement other measures that support and complement SSL VPN implementations. These measures help to ensure that the SSL VPN solution is implemented in an environment with the technical, management, and operational controls necessary to provide sufficient security for the SSL VPN implementation. Examples of supporting measures include:
- Establishing and maintaining control over all entry and exit points for the protected network, which helps to ensure its integrity.
- Incorporating SSL VPN considerations into organizational policies (e.g., identity management, remote access).
- Ensuring that all SSL VPN endpoints are secured and maintained properly to reduce the risk of SSL vulnerabilities.# VPN Compromise or Misuse

Although SSL VPNs are flexible enough to meet many needs, there are certain cases when other types of VPNs may provide a better solution. Network layer VPN protocols, primarily IPsec; data link layer VPN protocols, such as Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), and Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F); and application layer security protocols, including OpenPGP and Secure Shell (SSH), are all effective alternatives to SSL VPNs for particular needs and environments.

## 2. Network and Transport Layer Security
This section provides a general introduction to network and transport layer security. Network layer security protects network communications at the layer that is responsible for routing packets across networks. Transport layer security provides security at the layer responsible for end-to-end communications.

This section first introduces the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model and its layers and then discusses the need to use security controls at each layer to protect communications. It provides a brief introduction to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), primarily focused on the types of protection that SSL can provide for communications. This section also provides a brief introduction to virtual private networking (VPN) services and explains what types of protection a VPN can provide. It introduces three VPN architecture models and discusses the features and common uses of each model. This document discusses only the most common VPN scenarios and uses of SSL.

### 2.1 The Need for Network and Transport Layer Security
TCP/IP is widely used throughout the world to provide network communications. TCP/IP communications are composed of four layers that work together. When a user wants to transfer data across networks, the data is passed from the highest layer through intermediate layers to the lowest layer, with each layer adding information.

At each layer, the logical units are typically composed of a header and a payload. The payload consists of the information passed down from the previous layer, while the header contains layer-specific information such as addresses. At the application layer, the payload is the actual application data. The lowest layer sends the accumulated data through the physical network; the data is then passed up through the layers to its destination. Essentially, the data produced by a layer is encapsulated in a larger container by the layer below it. The four TCP/IP layers, from highest to lowest, are shown in Figure 2-1.

#### Application Layer
This layer sends and receives data for particular applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS), HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

#### Transport Layer
This layer provides connection-oriented or connectionless services for transporting application layer services between networks. The transport layer can optionally assure the reliability of communications. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are commonly used transport layer protocols.

#### Network Layer
This layer routes packets across networks. Internet Protocol (IP) is the primary protocol used at this layer.# TCP/IP Model and Security Controls

## Network Layer Protocols
- **Internet Protocol (IP)**: The fundamental network layer protocol for TCP/IP.
- **Other Protocols**: Commonly used protocols at the network layer include:
- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)

## Data Link Layer
- This layer handles communications on the physical network components.
- The best-known data link layer protocol is **Ethernet**.

## Security Controls in TCP/IP Model
Security controls exist for network communications at each layer of the TCP/IP model. Data is passed from the highest to the lowest layer, with each layer adding more information.

### Important Note
A security control at a higher layer cannot provide protection for lower layers, as the lower layers perform functions of which the higher layers are not aware.

### Security Controls Available at Each Layer

#### Application Layer
- Separate controls must be established for each application.
- If an application needs to protect sensitive data sent across networks, it may need to be modified to provide this protection.
- While this provides a high degree of control and flexibility, it may require significant resources to add and configure controls properly for each application.
- Designing a cryptographically sound application protocol is challenging, and implementing it properly can create vulnerabilities.
- Some applications, particularly off-the-shelf software, may not be capable of providing such protection.
- Application layer controls can protect application data but cannot protect TCP/IP information such as IP addresses.
- Whenever possible, application layer controls should be standards-based solutions that have been in use for some time.
- **Example**: Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is commonly used to encrypt email messages.

#### Transport Layer
- Controls at this layer can protect the data in a single communication session between two hosts.
- Since IP information is added at the network layer, transport layer controls cannot protect it.
- The most common use for transport layer protocols is securing HTTP traffic; the **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocol is typically used for this.
- TLS usually requires each application to support it; however, it is less intrusive than application layer controls.
- TLS does not need to understand the application’s functions or characteristics.
- Although using TLS may require modifying some applications, it is a well-tested protocol with several implementations, making it a relatively low-risk option compared to application layer protection.
- Traditionally, TLS has been used to protect HTTP-based communications and can be used with SSL portal VPNs.

#### Network Layer
- Controls at this layer can be applied to all applications, making them not application-specific.
- All network communications between two hosts or networks can be secured at this layer.# Network Security Controls

## Overview
Network security controls are essential for protecting data and IP information across various layers of communication. These controls can be categorized into different layers, each with its own advantages and limitations.

## Network Layer Controls
Network layer controls, such as Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), offer a robust solution for securing communications without requiring modifications to client or server applications.

### Advantages
- **Ease of Implementation**: Network layer controls can be enforced by network administrators to uphold security policies.
- **Protection of IP Information**: These controls safeguard both the data within packets and the IP information associated with each packet.

### Limitations
- **Less Flexibility**: Compared to transport and application layer controls, network layer controls provide less granularity in protecting specific applications.
- **SSL Tunnel VPNs**: These can secure both TCP and UDP communications, acting as network layer VPNs.

## Data Link Layer Controls
Data link layer controls are applied to all communications on a specific physical link, such as a dedicated circuit or a dial-up modem connection.

### Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Data link layer controls are relatively straightforward to implement.
- **Support for Multiple Protocols**: They can support various network layer protocols beyond IP.

### Limitations
- **Specific to Physical Links**: These controls cannot protect connections that involve multiple links, such as a VPN over the Internet.
- **Feasibility Issues**: Protecting an Internet-based connection would require deploying separate controls for each physical link, which is often impractical.

## Comparison of Layer Controls
- **Network Layer Security**: Frequently used for securing communications over shared networks like the Internet, providing a unified solution for protecting data from all applications.
- **Transport Layer Protocols**: For scenarios where only one or two applications require protection, transport layer controls (e.g., SSL) are often more suitable. They are commonly used for securing communications in HTTP-based applications and other protocols like SMTP, POP, IMAP, and FTP.

## Conclusion
While network layer security controls are effective for broad protection, specific applications may benefit more from transport or application layer controls. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each layer is crucial for implementing an effective security strategy.# Support for TLS

Users who wish to use web-based applications that are protected by TLS normally do not need to install any client software or reconfigure their systems. Newer applications of transport layer security protocols protect both HTTP and non-HTTP application communications, including client/server applications and other network traffic. Controls at each layer offer advantages and features that controls at other layers do not.

## Transport Layer Security Controls

Section 3 contains detailed information on transport layer security controls. Information on data link, network, and application layer alternatives to transport layer controls is provided in Section 6.

## Network Layer Security Control

IPsec has emerged as the most commonly used network layer security control for protecting communications, while SSL is the most commonly used transport layer security control. Depending on how IPsec and SSL are implemented and configured, both can provide any combination of the following types of protection:

### Types of Protection

- **Confidentiality**: IPsec and SSL can ensure that data cannot be read by unauthorized parties. This is accomplished by encrypting data using a cryptographic algorithm and a secret key—a value known only to the two parties exchanging data. The data can only be decrypted by someone who has the secret key.

- **Integrity**: IPsec and SSL can determine if data has been changed (intentionally or unintentionally) during transit. The integrity of data can be assured by generating a message authentication code (MAC) value, which is a keyed cryptographic checksum of the data. If the data is altered and the MAC is recalculated, the old and new MACs will differ.

- **Peer Authentication**: Each IPsec endpoint confirms the identity of the other IPsec endpoint with which it wishes to communicate, ensuring that the network traffic and data is being sent from the expected host. SSL authentication is typically performed one-way, authenticating the server to the client; however, SSL VPNs require authentication for both endpoints.

- **Replay Protection**: The same data is not delivered multiple times, and data is not delivered grossly out of order.

- **Traffic Analysis Protection**: A person monitoring network traffic cannot determine the contents of the network traffic or how much data is being exchanged. IPsec can also conceal which parties are communicating, whereas SSL leaves this information exposed. Frequency of communication may also be protected depending on implementation. Nevertheless, the number of packets being exchanged can be counted.

- **Access Control**: IPsec and SSL endpoints can perform filtering to ensure that only authorized users can access particular network resources. IPsec and SSL endpoints can also allow or block certain types of network traffic, such as allowing web server access but denying file sharing.

## Virtual Private Networking (VPN)

A VPN is a virtual network, built on top of existing physical networks, that can provide a secure communications mechanism for data and other information transmitted between networks. Because a...# VPN Overview

VPN can be used over existing networks, such as the Internet, to facilitate the secure transfer of sensitive data across public networks. This is often less expensive than alternatives such as dedicated private telecommunications lines between organizations or branch offices. VPNs can also provide flexible solutions, such as securing communications between remote telecommuters and the organization’s servers, regardless of where the telecommuters are located. A VPN can even be established within a single network to protect particularly sensitive communications from other parties on the same network.

## Risks Associated with VPNs

It is important to understand that VPNs do not remove all risk from networking. While VPNs can greatly reduce risk, particularly for communications that occur over public networks, they cannot eliminate all risk for such communications.

### Implementation Strength

One potential problem is the strength of the implementation. For example, flaws in an encryption algorithm or the software implementing the algorithm could allow attackers to decrypt intercepted traffic; random number generators that do not produce sufficiently random values could provide additional attack possibilities.

### Key Disclosure

Another issue is encryption key disclosure; an attacker who discovers a key could not only decrypt traffic but potentially also pose as a legitimate user.

### Availability Concerns

Another area of risk involves availability. A common model for information assurance is based on the concepts of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Although VPNs are designed to support confidentiality and integrity, they generally do not improve availability, the ability for authorized users to access systems as needed. In fact, many VPN implementations actually tend to decrease availability somewhat, because they add more components and services to the existing network infrastructure. This is highly dependent upon the chosen VPN architecture model and the details of the implementation.

## Types of SSL VPNs

The following sections describe the two primary types of SSL VPNs: SSL portal VPNs and SSL tunnel VPNs. (There is a third type, SSL gateway-to-gateway VPNs, that is available in some implementations. These are rarely used because they have very similar features to IPsec VPNs but less flexibility; they are therefore not discussed in this document.) Both types of SSL VPNs are typically used to provide remote users access to multiple services controlled and administered by the SSL VPN gateway.

### SSL VPN Gateways

SSL VPN gateways are sometimes single-purpose hardware systems that contain the software needed to perform the SSL VPN tasks. In other cases, firewall and router hardware systems contain SSL VPN capabilities and thus become SSL VPN gateways when those capabilities are turned on in the system’s administrative interface.

### Standards for SSL VPNs

It should be noted that, although there are standards for the TLS protocol, there are currently no standards for any type of SSL VPN. For example, SSL VPN features such as access control and endpoint security have not been standardized. Thus, the descriptions here are based on common implementations of SSL VPNs at the time this document was being prepared.

#### 2.2.1 SSL Portal VPNs

(Additional details about SSL Portal VPNs would follow here.)# SSL Portal VPN and SSL Tunnel VPN

## SSL Portal VPN

An SSL portal VPN allows a user to use a single standard SSL connection to a website to securely access multiple network services. The site accessed is typically called a portal because it has a single page that leads to many other resources. SSL portal VPNs act as transport-layer VPNs that work over a single network port, namely the TCP port for SSL-protected HTTP (443).

### Accessing the SSL VPN Gateway

The remote user accesses the SSL VPN gateway using any modern web browser, identifies himself or herself to the gateway using an authentication method supported by the gateway, and then is presented with a web page that acts as the portal to the other services. These other services might include:

- Links to other web servers
- Shared file directories
- Web-based email systems
- Applications that run on protected servers
- Any other services that can be channeled through a web page

To the user, an SSL portal VPN is a website with more options of services available after the user has authenticated. To access an SSL portal VPN, the user enters the portal’s URL in a web browser just as they would enter the URL for any other web page. These URLs typically use the `https:` scheme to start SSL immediately, but many SSL VPNs allow users to first enter an `http:` URL that then redirects to a secure SSL port.

### Browser Compatibility

SSL portal VPNs work with essentially any modern web browser. Specifically, they work with browsers whether or not the browsers allow (or support) active content. Thus, SSL portal VPNs are accessible to more users than SSL tunnel VPNs.

## SSL Tunnel VPNs

An SSL tunnel VPN allows a user to use a typical web browser to securely access multiple network services through a tunnel that is running under SSL. SSL tunnel VPNs require that the web browser be able to handle specific types of active content (e.g., Java, JavaScript, Flash, or ActiveX) and that the user be able to run them. Most browsers that handle such applications and plug-ins also allow the user or administrator to block them from being executed.

### Tunnel Characteristics

The “tunnel” in an SSL tunnel VPN is both similar and quite different from the tunnels seen in typical IPsec VPNs. The two types of tunnels are similar in that almost all IP traffic is fully protected by the tunnel, giving the user full access to services on the network protected by the VPN gateway. However, the tunnels are quite different in that SSL/VPN tunnels are usually created in SSL using a non-standard tunneling method, while IPsec tunnels are created with methods described in the IPsec standard.

### Protocol and Application Support

The tunneling in an SSL tunnel VPN allows a wide variety of protocols and applications to be run through it. For example, essentially any protocol that runs over TCP or UDP can be tunneled through such a gateway, making the remote user’s experience of the protected network very similar to being directly on the network.

To the user, an SSL tunnel VPN may appear quite different from a typical website because the tunneling plug-in or application needs to be loaded into the user’s browser before they can access the VPN. This might involve warning messages about the software being loaded, and it could also prevent users from entering the VPN if their web browsers are instructed not to allow such programs.# SSL VPN Administration and TCP/IP Security Overview

## 2.2.3 Administering SSL VPNs

The administration of both SSL portal VPNs and SSL tunnel VPNs is similar. The gateway administrator needs to specify local policy in at least two broad areas:

- **Access**: All SSL VPNs allow the administrator to specify which users have access to the VPN services. User authentication might be done with a simple password through a web form, or through more sophisticated authentication mechanisms.

- **Capabilities**: The administrator can specify the services to which each authorized user has access. For example, some users might have access to only certain web pages, while others might have access to those web pages plus other services.

Different SSL VPNs have very different administrative interfaces and capabilities for allowing access and specifying allowed actions for users. For example, many but not all SSL VPNs allow validation of users through the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) protocol. Additionally, some SSL VPNs allow the administrator to create groups of users who have the same access methods and capabilities; this makes adding new users to the system easier than gateways that require the administrator to specify both of these for each new user.

## 2.3 Summary

Section 2 describes the TCP/IP model and its layers—application, transport, network, and data link—and explains how security controls at each layer provide different types of protection for TCP/IP communications. SSL, a transport layer security control, can provide several types of protection for data, depending on its configuration. The section describes SSL VPNs and highlights the two primary SSL VPN architecture models (SSL portal VPNs and SSL tunnel VPNs). The following summarizes the key points from Section 2:

- TCP/IP is widely used throughout the world to provide network communications. The TCP/IP model is composed of the following four layers, each having its own security controls that provide different types of protection:

- **Application Layer**: This layer sends and receives data for particular applications. Separate controls must be established for each application; this provides a very high degree of control and flexibility over each application’s security, but it may be very resource-intensive. However, inventing new application layer security controls can create vulnerabilities. Another potential issue is that some applications may not be capable of providing such protection or of being modified to do so.

- **Transport Layer**: This layer provides connection-oriented or connectionless services for transporting application layer services across networks. Controls at this layer can protect the data in a single communications session between two hosts. The most frequently used transport layer control is SSL, which most often secures HTTP traffic but is also used to...# VPN Implementation and Architecture

## Overview of VPNs
- VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are built on top of existing networks to provide secure communication for data and IP information transmitted between networks.

## Layers of VPN Operation
### Transport Layer
- Transport layer controls must be supported by both clients and servers.
- SSL portal VPNs operate at this layer.

### Network Layer
- Responsible for routing packets across networks.
- Controls at this layer apply to all applications and do not require modifications to applications.
- Provides less control and flexibility for protecting specific applications compared to transport and application layer controls.
- Protects both the data within packets and the IP information for each packet.
- IPsec VPNs operate at the network layer and can secure both TCP and UDP traffic.
- SSL tunnel VPNs also operate as network layer VPNs.

### Data Link Layer
- Handles communications on the physical network components.
- Suitable for protecting a specific physical link, such as a dedicated circuit between two buildings or a dial-up modem connection to an ISP.
- Generally not feasible for protecting connections involving several links, such as those across the Internet.

## Key Protocols
- **IPsec**: A framework of open standards for ensuring private communications over IP networks; the most commonly used network layer security control.
- **SSL**: An open standards track protocol that provides secure communications at the transport layer.
- Both protocols offer various protections, including:
- Maintaining confidentiality and integrity
- Authenticating the origin of data
- Preventing packet replay and traffic analysis
- Providing access protection

## Limitations of VPNs
- While VPNs can reduce networking risks, they cannot eliminate them.
- Potential flaws in algorithms or software can be exploited by attackers.
- VPN implementations may negatively impact availability due to added components and services in existing network infrastructures.

## SSL VPN Architectures
### SSL Portal VPN
- Allows remote users with almost any web browser to connect to a VPN gateway and access services from a website provided on the gateway.
- More accessible to a wider range of users than SSL tunnel VPNs, especially for browsers with security policies that prevent running active content downloaded from the Internet.

### SSL Tunnel VPN
- Allows remote users with web browsers that support active content to access the network protected by a VPN gateway.
- Offers more capabilities than SSL portal VPNs, as more services can be provided more easily.

## Conclusion
- Understanding the fundamentals of SSL VPNs and their architecture is crucial for implementing secure communication mechanisms in network infrastructures.# SSL VPN Overview

SSL VPNs provide secure remote access to an organization’s resources. An SSL VPN consists of one or more VPN devices that users connect to using their web browsers. The traffic between the web browser and SSL VPN device is encrypted with the SSL protocol. SSL VPNs provide remote users with access to web applications and client/server applications, and with connectivity to internal networks. They offer versatility and ease of use because they use the SSL protocol that is included with all standard web browsers, so the client usually does not require configuration by the user.

This section of the document discusses SSL VPNs and their services and features.

## 3.1 SSL VPN Architecture

Figure 3-1 provides a high-level view of a typical SSL VPN architecture. That architecture is the same for both SSL portal VPNs and SSL tunnel VPNs.

Typical SSL VPN users include people in remote offices, mobile users, business partners, and customers. Hardware clients include various types of devices, such as public kiosks, home personal computers (PC), PDAs, or smartphones, which may or may not be controlled or managed by the organization. The SSL VPN may also be accessed from any location including an airport, a coffee shop, or a hotel room, as long as the location has connectivity to the Internet and the user has a web client that is capable of using the particular SSL VPN. All traffic is encrypted as it traverses public networks such as the Internet. The SSL VPN gateway is the endpoint for the secure connection and provides various services and features (most SSL VPN products are standalone hardware appliances, although there are some software-based solutions that are installed on user-supplied servers).

## 3.2 SSL VPN Functions

Providing secure remote access to a wide variety of users and devices at many locations calls for a diverse set of SSL VPN services and features. Most SSL VPNs have one or more of the following three core functions:

- **Proxying**: A proxy is an intermediary device or program that provides communication and other services between a client and server. It has the ability to represent itself as the server to the client, and vice versa. A proxy may service requests internally or translate the information and pass it on to other servers. Proxying is a core function of an SSL portal VPN. The simplest form of an SSL portal VPN involves secure proxying of web pages. The SSL portal VPN acts as a gateway by mediating the traffic between the user and the application. It receives the request from the user, connects to the web server, downloads the information, and sends the information back to the user over the SSL connection. The proxy performs encryption or decryption and content inspection.

## 3.3 SSL VPN Features and Services

This section describes the various features and services provided by SSL VPNs and the security controls used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

## 3.4 Technical Details of SSL and TLS Protocols

This section briefly covers the technical details of the SSL and TLS protocols.

## 3.5 Challenges Involved with SSL VPNs

This section addresses the challenges involved with SSL VPNs.# SSL VPN Overview

## Application Translation
Application translation converts information from one protocol to another. It is often used to convert a legacy or proprietary protocol into a more widely used or standard protocol. This process facilitates system integration and communication between applications and devices.

- **Proxying**: Application translation uses proxying to interact with both sides of the connection with the appropriate protocol.
- **SSL Portal VPNs**: SSL portal VPNs utilize application translation for applications that are not Web-enabled, allowing users to access these applications via a Web browser.
- **Example**: For instance, to provide file server access, an SSL portal VPN would communicate with a file server using the appropriate protocol, such as the Common Internet File System (CIFS) or the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and translate the information into a Web-based format for user access.
- **Translator Engine**: Application translation requires a translator engine for each supported protocol.

## Network Extension
Network extension is a method of providing partial or complete network access to remote users.

- **Remote Access**: Users can connect to the network and access internal resources as if they were physically located on the internal local area network (LAN). This eliminates the need for creating Web-specific portals for all applications requiring remote access.
- **SSL Tunnel VPN**: An SSL tunnel VPN network extension provides a secure connection from the user’s system to an organization’s network.
- **Host-to-Gateway Tunnel**: This tunnel can handle arbitrary traffic, similar to a host-to-gateway IPsec VPN.
- **Tunneling Options**: SSL tunnel VPN devices can support full or split tunneling:
- **Full Tunneling**: All network traffic goes through the tunnel to the organization.
- **Split Tunneling**: Organization-specific traffic routes through the SSL VPN tunnel, while other traffic uses the remote user’s default gateway.
- **Client Installation**: Network extension requires a client to be installed either as a plug-in in the user’s Web browser or as a program on the user’s system, necessitating administrative access to the local system.
- **Active Content Agent**: The client is typically an active content agent, requiring the system to load the agent and have the necessary privileges to run it.
- **Challenges**: This can pose challenges on public systems where users might lack those privileges, and on managed systems where security policies prevent such applets and controls.
- **Port Forwarding**: A more limited form of network extension is sometimes referred to as port forwarding.

## Core Functions of SSL VPNs
The three core functions allow SSL VPNs to provide secure remote access to a variety of applications.

- **Quality and Effectiveness**: SSL VPN products vary in quality and effectiveness based on how they implement these core functions.
- **Protocol Support**: For example, some SSL VPN products may offer support for different protocols via proxy and application translation, while others might provide varying levels of control over network access for network extensions.
- **Evaluation**: When evaluating SSL VPN products, it is crucial to identify the remote access needs and applications served.

## SSL VPN Features and Security Services
The document concludes with a mention of SSL VPN features and security services, which are essential for ensuring secure remote access.# SSL VPN Features and Security Services

In addition to the three core functions, SSL VPNs include other features and security services. These elements often vary in breadth, depth, and completeness, so side-by-side comparisons of SSL VPN products often result in more differences than similarities. Therefore, it is important to identify and define requirements, and evaluate several products.

## Common SSL VPN Features

### Manageability
- Manageability includes device management, status reporting, logging, and auditing.

### High Availability
- High availability is a failover feature to ensure availability during device or component interruptions.

### Scalability
- Scalability is the ability to support more users, concurrent sessions, and throughput than a single SSL VPN device can typically handle. Scalability is often integrated with high availability by balancing the VPN load amongst multiple SSL VPN devices.

### Customization
- Customization is the ability to control the appearance of the SSL VPN web pages that the users see when they first access the VPN. Besides layout and color preferences, customized portals are often necessary to support PDAs and smartphones over the SSL VPN.

## Common SSL VPN Security Services

### Authentication
- Authentication is the process a VPN uses to limit access to protected services by forcing users to identify themselves. This feature includes the ability to support strong authentication and to integrate with current authentication mechanisms.

### Encryption and Integrity Protection
- Encryption protects the confidentiality of data as it traverses the Internet, while integrity protection ensures that the data is not altered as it traverses the Internet. Both are inherent in SSL.

### Access Control
- Access control permits or restricts access to applications at a granular level, such as per-user, per-group, and per-resource.

### Endpoint Security Controls
- Endpoint security controls validate the security compliance of the client system that is attempting to use the SSL VPN. For example, host integrity checks may verify that firewall, malware detection, and antivirus software are enabled and running on the client system, and the host is up-to-date on its patches. Endpoint security controls also include security protection mechanisms, such as web browser cache cleaners, that remove sensitive information from client systems.

### Intrusion Prevention
- Intrusion prevention involves inspecting the data after it has been decrypted in the SSL VPN for potential attacks. It may also include anti-malware functionality to detect viruses, worms, and other malicious payloads and block or change network access rights based on the results of such checks.

## Detailed Features and Services
Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.8 provide details and examples of the various SSL VPN features and security services.

### 3.3.1 Manageability
SSL VPNs offer a variety of manageability features such as status reporting, logging, and auditing. Status reporting includes identifying connected users and reporting usage data in a graphical format. Logging includes the ability to export logs, debug logging, and automate log rollover.# Auditing and Manageability Features of SSL VPNs

## Auditing
Auditing includes auditing application access, RADIUS-based accounting, and persistent storage of auditing information. Another manageability feature is the ability to terminate sessions as needed.

## Documentation
A manageability feature that is often overlooked is documentation. It is beneficial to have documentation for SSL VPN usage, configuration, and troubleshooting. Documentation may also include context-sensitive help within the management interface.

## Partitioned or Delegated Management
Another manageability feature that is beneficial for SSL VPNs is partitioned or delegated management. This allows different aspects of the SSL VPN device to be managed by different groups or individuals. This feature can be beneficial for service providers, collocation facilities, and organizations with different groups sharing the SSL VPN device.

## Remote Management
It is also quite useful for an SSL VPN to be able to be managed remotely, such as by a system administrator who is not on-site. Remote management requires greater security to prevent attackers from watching and possibly altering the management sessions; in SSL VPNs, this security is normally provided by running all remote management sessions under SSL.

# High Availability and Scalability

## High Availability
Two other important features for SSL VPNs are high availability and scalability. High availability solutions use two or more SSL VPN devices configured in either active/passive or active/active mode.

### Active/Passive Mode
In an active/passive solution, one device actively services connections, while the other device is waiting in standby mode. The two devices continuously exchange “heartbeat” messages to communicate their status with one another. If the standby device does not receive a heartbeat message from the active device for a preconfigured time period, it will assume that the active device is no longer operating and take over servicing connections.

### Active/Active Mode
In an active/active solution, both devices are actively servicing connections at the same time. If one device fails, the other device will service all connections if it has been properly sized to do so. High availability allows the SSL VPN to survive the loss of a device or device component.

## Challenges of High Availability
In either active/passive or active/active mode, one of the challenges of high availability is properly propagating and sharing information between the devices. Another challenge is maintaining state information about existing connections in the event of a failure. SSL VPN proxying and network extension functionality each handle state information differently. Another consideration is transparency of failover to the users. Depending on how state information is shared, the user may or may not need to re-authenticate after a failure.

## Scalability
SSL VPNs support scalability with load-balancing features. Both high availability and load balancing often use a virtual IP address that is shared across multiple SSL VPN devices.

### Active/Passive Architecture
In an active/passive architecture, the passive device has the ability to take over the virtual IP address and associated traffic if the active device fails.

### Active/Active Architecture
In an active/active architecture, both devices service the virtual IP address. SSL VPN devices configured as active/passive typically are not providing any scalability features, whereas active/active configurations use either an integrated load balancer or an external load balancer to manage traffic effectively.# VPN Functionality and Features

## 3.3.3 Portal Customization

Portal customization is a feature that allows an administrator to control the appearance of the SSL VPN web interface that the end users see and interact with. Both SSL portal VPNs and SSL tunnel VPNs usually have portal pages. SSL tunnel VPNs often have portal pages for users to change their settings, request help from a system administrator, and so on.

Some products lack portal customization features; nevertheless, finding the right files on the SSL VPN device and editing them may allow customization of the look and feel of the portal. Other products have built-in configuration settings to control the colors, icons, and layout of the portal. Some products only provide system-wide customization, while others allow portal customization on a per-group basis.

Besides layout and color preferences, customized portals are often necessary to support PDAs and smartphones over SSL VPNs. Some products allow portal customization per system type to accommodate the limited functionality of PDAs and smartphones. Portal customization sometimes integrates with the endpoint security controls and access control. If an end system does not pass all of the endpoint security checks and access is restricted, the user may be presented with a limited portal.

Some advanced products also have the capability to allow users to control the layout and customization of their own portals. This includes creating bookmarks, adding icons, and saving passwords.

## 3.3.4 Authentication

SSL VPNs support the authentication security service either directly through an integrated authentication method, or indirectly via an external authentication server, or both. Traditional SSL web page authentication relies on server-side authentication, so that users trust the server with which they are communicating. SSL VPN authentication takes this a step further by requiring both server-side and client-side authentication.

SSL VPNs support flexible client authentication methods, such as username and password, smart cards, two-factor authentication, and X.509 digital certificates. For the use of methods involving tokens, the SSL VPN must be able to handle the various messages, such as PIN change requests, that are involved in token solutions.

When digital certificates are used for client authentication, each endpoint has its own digital certificate that contains a public key. An endpoint uses the corresponding private key to digitally sign data before sending it to the other endpoint, which verifies the signature using the peer’s public key. The digital signature algorithm choices are RSA and the Digital Signature Standard (DSS).

In addition to authentication with certificates, the SSL VPN should also support certificate revocation list (CRL) checking. The SSL VPN should be able to generate certificate-signing requests for its own digital certificates. Note that most SSL VPNs that allow digital certificates for client authentication...# SSL VPN Authentication and Access Control

## Authentication Methods

Authentication in SSL VPNs can be achieved through various methods, including:

- **Proprietary Mechanisms**: Client digital certificate authentication may not work well in typical web browsers, especially for users with multiple client certificates issued for different purposes.

- **External Authentication Servers**: SSL VPNs can integrate with external authentication servers such as:
- RADIUS
- Active Directory (AD)
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

This integration allows VPNs to leverage existing authentication databases. Access to group information on these servers is crucial since security and access control are often expressed in terms of groups.

### Active Directory Access

Windows Active Directory is a common authentication server that can be accessed directly or via LDAP. However, some SSL VPN products do not support direct AD authentication. For LDAP access, administrators need a strong understanding of the directory's structure. Using an SSL VPN that communicates directly with AD can simplify this process.

### User Class Authentication

SSL VPN authentication methods can be applied on an individual or group basis. Different classes of users may utilize different forms of authentication. For example:
- Employees may authenticate using a username and password.
- Business partners may authenticate using digital certificates.

Some SSL VPN products can combine various authentication methods, such as requiring both a digital certificate and a username/password. It is essential to evaluate potential SSL VPN products for interoperability with an organization’s authentication servers.

## Encryption and Integrity Protection

SSL VPNs utilize the underlying SSL protocol to ensure:

- **Confidentiality**: Data is protected through encryption.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures that the data has not been modified.

The encryption and data integrity provided by SSL are inherent to the SSL protocol itself, not features added by the SSL VPN product. SSL ensures protection between the user’s computer and the VPN gateway. Many SSL VPNs also support SSL encryption between the gateway and web hosts on the protected network for applications requiring encryption and integrity protection.

## Access Control

Access control features in SSL VPN products can vary significantly. Some products may have a default allow policy, granting authenticated users unrestricted access to the protected network. While this may suffice for a wide-open network, most SSL VPN implementations require controlled access to provide different services to various user types.

### Granular Access Control

Granular access control is essential for organizations that need to manage access based on user roles and requirements. This feature supports the fundamental need for security and tailored access within SSL VPN implementations.# Goals of SSL VPNs

The primary goals of SSL VPNs are to provide access to a variety of groups and users, including:

- Mobile employees
- Branch offices
- Business partners
- Customers

## Access Control

Some SSL VPN products allow highly granular access control, which can include:

- The particular application or file being accessed
- Day and time
- Type of browser
- Authentication method used
- Computer type and location
- User identification
- Other characteristics

The SSL VPN uses an access control policy to provide different services based on these characteristics.

### Access Control Policies

Table 3-1 provides examples of typical access control policies. Access privileges may be granted to individuals, groups, or resources. For ease of configuration, access control is typically configured based on groups. Each user is assigned to one or more groups, each group having certain security parameters. Group information may be accessed from the authentication database, such as the LDAP directory.

Access control may also be defined for a set of resources instead of an individual resource. This approach makes adding and removing resources to and from a group transparent to the users and reduces policy complexity. In some specific instances, user-level parameters are also set.

### Integration with Endpoint Security

Access control can also be integrated with endpoint security controls. SSL VPNs can use host integrity checking to check the status of the SSL VPN client before access is granted. Some SSL VPNs have the capability to perform this checking either before or after authentication to determine the appropriate access controls.

Access control in this context may be as simple as allowing or denying access completely, or more elaborate, such as providing restricted access to selected information based on host integrity checks. Access controls may also be configured per-user, per-group, and per-resource in terms of host integrity checking.

It is beneficial to have the ability to bypass the endpoint security restrictions for certain circumstances, such as disaster response. Bypassing endpoint security for special circumstances may be accomplished through a special access control policy setting or whitelist.

### Examples of Access Control Policies

Table 3-2 shows some examples of access control policies in conjunction with endpoint security controls. These examples are an extension of the examples in Table 3-1.

1. **CEO Access**: The first user is the CEO, who is accessing the SSL VPN from home via an organization-issued laptop. The firewall and antivirus software pass the security checks since they are enabled and up-to-date. Based on user and group access policies, and the passing of the endpoint security checks, the CEO may access:
- Intranet servers
- Email
- Executive folder of the administrative server
- Community Relations server

2. **Sales Team Member Access**: The next user is John Smith, a traveling member of the sales team. He is attempting to access the SSL VPN from a public computer in an Internet café. The firewall passes the security checks, but the antivirus software is not up-to-date on its signatures. Based on user and group access policies and the fact that only some of the security checks passed, John is granted access to:
- Email
- Ability to download (but not upload) files from the sales server

(He would have been given more privileges if he had passed all the security checks.)# SSL VPN Access Control and Endpoint Security

## User Access Example
Sally Jones, an employee at a business partner, XYZ Corp, is attempting to access the SSL VPN from a trusted partner network. Based on user and group access policies, and the passing of the endpoint security checks, Sally is granted access to the extranet partner server and the Community Relations server.

## Importance of Understanding Needs and Requirements
Knowing the needs and requirements for the SSL VPN solution, such as the types of users and the reasons they will use the SSL VPN, will help organizations choose a product with the appropriate level of access control capability. These needs and requirements will also help organizations determine the level of granularity needed for access controls.

## 3.3.7 Endpoint Security Controls
Some SSL VPNs provide endpoint security controls that include host integrity checking and security protection mechanisms. Host integrity checks help ensure that the client system is in compliance with an organization’s security policy. These checks are performed before a session is begun and may be periodically rechecked during the session.

### Integration with Access Control
Endpoint security controls are sometimes tightly integrated with access control to analyze the client system and apply access controls based on the results. For example:
- An up-to-date company-issued laptop connecting from a remote site might be allowed full access.
- A personal laptop that complies with the standard firewall and antivirus checks but is attempting access from an untrusted wireless hotspot may be granted only limited access.

### Security Protection Mechanisms
Endpoint security controls also include security protection mechanisms, such as web browser cache cleaners that remove temporary files, cookies, and other session information from the web browser used for SSL VPN access. This supports the use of the SSL VPN from public locations.

## Implementation of Endpoint Security Controls
Endpoint security controls can be implemented in a variety of ways, which often differentiates products.

### Policy Definition
Endpoint security starts with a policy definition. The policy definition includes:
- What the host integrity checker should look for.
- The actions to take depending on what it finds.

If host integrity checkers are used, they should be configured to execute before the logon process to look for malware such as keystroke loggers. Typical host integrity checks may look for:
- Operating system type and version.
- Antivirus and personal firewall status and configurations.
- A specific file, registry key, or running process.

Depending on the product, checking for running processes may be as simple as looking for the process name or as elaborate as verifying the actual validity of the process.

### Integrated Endpoint Security Software
Some SSL VPN products include their own integrated endpoint security software. This software may be part of the SSL VPN product or an add-on for an additional cost. Other SSL VPN products rely on third-party software for endpoint security, allowing organizations to leverage their existing products, such as cache cleaning tools, malware scanners, and compliance checking software, with their SSL VPNs.

### Third-Party Integration
Some of these SSL VPNs can only integrate with a single specific third-party product, while others can integrate with a variety of third-party products.# Network Security and Remote Access

## Introduction
Connecting into the network via the network extension function is a critical aspect of network security. Such systems are generally of higher concern than those that are just accessing websites, as they are usually granted much broader access to resources.

## Endpoint Security Controls
Endpoint security controls should be used with care. Due to the nature of remote access, client systems are more likely to originate from uncontrolled environments. It is imperative that remote systems are evaluated before allowing access to internal resources and cleaned after access is granted.

There is no industry-wide standard for endpoint security controls; many leading network and security companies are working to create vendor-driven standards.

## Intrusion Prevention
Some SSL VPN products provide an integrated intrusion prevention security service. They inspect the contents of the data after it has been decrypted by the SSL VPN for potential attacks and various forms of malware, including viruses and worms.

The SSL VPN may include its own anti-malware and intrusion detection software, or it may integrate with third-party software. Performing content inspection adds processing time and latency to the throughput of packets. For high-volume networks, this latency, in addition to the latency of the encryption and decryption process, may exceed tolerable limits. In those cases, it is best to offload the intrusion prevention capabilities to a specialized intrusion prevention system (IPS) device on the inside of the trusted network (that is, after the SSL VPN has decrypted the data).

## SSL Protocol Basics
The security of the data sent over an SSL VPN relies on the security of the SSL protocol. The SSL protocol allows a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as an SSL VPN) to negotiate the type of security to be used during an SSL session. Thus, it is critical to ensure that the security agreed to by the remote user and the SSL gateway meets the security requirements of the organization using the SSL VPN.

### Types of Security Negotiated
There are three types of security that the client and server can negotiate:
1. The version of SSL
2. The type of cryptography
3. The authentication method

All three are important to the security of the communications channel that is established and are thus important to SSL VPN systems. These are discussed in more detail in the following sections.

### Reference to NIST Guidelines
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations, describes the technology used in SSL and TLS in detail. Readers of this document who want to know more about these technologies are encouraged to read that publication.

## Versions of SSL and TLS
In this document, the terms SSL and TLS are often used together to describe the same protocol. In fact, SSL refers to all versions of the SSL protocol as defined by the IETF, while TLS refers only to versions 3.1 and later of the SSL protocol.

Two versions of TLS have been standardized: TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. TLS 1.0 is the same as SSL 3.1; there are no versions of SSL after 3.1. As of the writing of this guide, work is being done on TLS version 1.2. TLS is approved for use in the protection of data.# SSL and TLS Protocols

## SSL Versions
Different SSL VPNs and web browsers use different versions of the SSL and TLS protocols. For example, some browsers support SSL 3.0 but not TLS 1.0 or 1.1, while others support TLS 1.0 but not SSL 3.0. Each version of SSL or TLS is incompatible with other versions, so both the browser and the SSL VPN must have at least one version of SSL in common. Additionally, they must share a version that meets the security policy of the organization running the SSL VPN; otherwise, communication will not be possible.

## 3.4.2 Cryptography Used in SSL Sessions
There are many types of cryptographic functions used in security protocols. The most widely known cryptographic features include:

- **Confidentiality**: Secrecy of data
- **Integrity**: Ability to detect even minute changes in the data
- **Signature**: Ability to trace the origin of the data

The combination of these features is crucial for the overall security of a communications stream. SSL employs four significant types of features: confidentiality, integrity, signature, and key establishment (the method by which a key is agreed upon by both parties).

SSL uses cipher suites to define the set of cryptographic functions that a client and server use when communicating. This differs from protocols like IPsec and S/MIME, where the two parties agree to individual cryptographic functions. In SSL, the exchange effectively states, “Here is a set of functions to be used together, and here is another set I am willing to use.” In contrast, IPsec and S/MIME say, “Here are the confidentiality functions I am willing to use, here are the integrity functions I am willing to use, and here are the signature algorithms I am willing to use,” allowing the other side to create a set from those choices.

Just as the SSL client and server need to use the same version of SSL, they also need to use the same cipher suite; otherwise, communication cannot occur. The organization running the SSL VPN selects which cipher suites meet its security goals and configures the SSL VPN gateway to use only those cipher suites.

## 3.4.3 Authentication Used for Identifying SSL Servers
When a web browser connects to an SSL server, such as an SSL VPN gateway, the user needs a way to know that the browser is communicating with a trusted server. SSL uses certificates signed by trusted entities to authenticate the server to the web user. (SSL can also use certificates to authenticate users to servers, but this is rarely done.)

Server authentication occurs early in the SSL process, immediately after the user sends its first message to the SSL server. In that first message, the web browser specifies which types of certificate algorithms it can handle; the two common choices are RSA and DSS. In the second message, the SSL server responds with a certificate of one of the types that the browser indicated it understands. After receiving the certificate, the web browser verifies that the identity in the certificate (i.e., the domain name listed in the certificate) matches the domain name to which the web browser attempted to connect.# SSL VPN Overview

## Introduction
Some SSL VPNs use certificates issued by the vendor of the SSL VPN, and those certificates do not link through a chain of trust to a root certificate that is normally trusted by most users. If that is the case, the user should add the SSL VPN's own certificate to the user's list of directly-trusted certificates.

It is important to note that users should not add the root certificate of the SSL VPN's manufacturer to the list of certification authorities that the user trusts, since the manufacturer’s security policies and controls may differ from those of the organization. Other SSL VPNs produce self-signed certificates that do not chain to any trusted root certificate; as before, the user should add the SSL VPN's own certificate to the user's list of directly-trusted certificates.

## Certificate Security
Certificates are signed with keys of a specified length. The security of the authentication is linked to the length of the key that is protecting the identity in the certificate. If an SSL server uses a key of insufficient length to protect its identity, the Web client might not want to trust the identity at all. In most Web browsers, there are mechanisms to check the length of the key that was used by the SSL server after the browser has successfully made an SSL connection.

## SSL VPN Challenges
SSL VPNs are rapidly maturing technologies. Nevertheless, they still face several challenges:

### Application and Client Interoperability
This is the biggest challenge for SSL VPNs. SSL VPNs must be able to export a large variety of applications to remote connections of various types. There are many factors that can affect interoperability, including:
- Operating system type and version
- Browser type and version
- Device type (e.g., laptop, PDA, smartphone)
- Location (e.g., home or public kiosk)
- Specifics of the applications and protocols to be accessed

For example, some SSL VPN products offer support for PDAs, but most offer limited (if any) support for smartphones. Some SSL VPN devices support phones via a browser for web-based access, but few support them from an agent perspective, allowing access to client/server applications.

### Client/Server Application Support
SSL VPNs are also still struggling with client/server applications. Some VPNs use application translation and network extension, along with special clients, to establish the appropriate access. Each SSL VPN product that uses network extension tends to have a unique solution to client/server applications. In addition, not all SSL VPN products support the same applications; some support more than others and each has niche areas.

### Network Extension
Although the network extension function is a core part of SSL tunnel VPNs, it still presents several challenges. Network extension requires a client to be installed on the end user’s system. Installing this client on a public kiosk or on a PC that has policies against downloading programs and plug-ins may not be possible due to insufficient privileges. Because network extension gives a remote user complete access to internal systems, specific per-application access controls may be difficult to enforce.

### Endpoint Security
Endpoint security for unmanaged PCs and public computers remains a significant concern.# SSL VPNs: Challenges and Summary

## Challenges

### Trusting Endpoint Responses
One of the significant challenges with SSL VPNs is trusting the endpoint responses to the host integrity checks. This includes performing proper sanitization of sensitive information from the client system when the session is terminated.

### Unmanaged Public Client Systems
Unmanaged public client systems are less likely to have antivirus and firewall software enabled and up-to-date. A compromised public computer could trick the host integrity checks by circumventing them or simulating firewalls, antivirus software, and other required security controls. These systems are also more likely to be infected with malware, such as Trojan horses and keystroke loggers, which could gain access to passwords and other sensitive information. Additionally, proper sanitization of these systems after the session terminates often requires elevated privileges.

### Clientless Operation
SSL VPNs are often described as being clientless, which is marketed as an advantage over traditional IPsec VPNs. For web-enabled applications, the web browser is the only client piece needed to connect via an SSL portal VPN. In other cases, dynamically downloaded agents, which may require software installation, are needed to provide access to legacy and client/server applications and network layer connections to non-web-enabled applications; these are the hallmarks of SSL tunnel VPNs. Proper privileges are needed to install the software and make appropriate system configurations. This has caused much debate in the security community over the marketing of SSL tunnel VPNs as clientless. In cases where dynamic agents are necessary, some systems and locations, such as public kiosks, may be unable to install the appropriate software or use the SSL VPN.

## Summary
SSL VPNs can support a range of users on various computers, accessing resources from many locations. They provide secure remote access to internal services such as email, file servers, and other applications in a web-based format. SSL VPNs use the SSL protocol, which is included in all standard web browsers, to secure the transmission of data between the user and the organization as it traverses public networks.

SSL VPNs consist of three core functions to enable secure access to internal resources:

1. **Proxying**: This provides the simplest form of an SSL VPN by enabling encryption and authentication for internal web sites.
2. **Application Translation**: Often used to access non-web-enabled applications by converting a legacy or proprietary protocol into a more widely used or standard protocol.
3. **Network Extension**: This provides complete network access to remote users as if they were physically located on the internal local area network. Users with network extension can access all network resources, not just web servers; this is particularly useful in organizations with custom applications that cannot be easily translated to the web.# SSL VPN Evaluation and Recommendations

SSL VPNs vary in breadth, depth, and completeness of features and security services. This makes it important to identify and define requirements, and evaluate several products to determine their fit into the organization. Recommendations and considerations include the following:

## Identifying Remote Access Needs
- Because some SSL VPN products cannot cover all remote access needs, it is recommended to identify the remote access needs and the applications that require remote access.

## Protocol Support
- Each SSL VPN supports different protocols via proxy and application translation. In addition, some SSL VPN products have concentrated their efforts and expertise in supporting certain protocols and applications. It is crucial to make sure that the SSL VPN provides the necessary proxies and application translators for the applications that require remote access.

## Manageability Features
- SSL VPN manageability features such as status reporting, logging, and auditing should provide adequate capabilities for the organization to effectively operate and manage the SSL VPN and to extract detailed usage information.

## High Availability and Scalability
- The SSL VPN high availability and scalability features should support the organization’s requirements for failover, load balancing, and throughput. State and information sharing is recommended to keep the failover process transparent to the user.

## Portal Customization
- SSL VPN portal customization should allow the organization to control the look and feel of the portal and to customize the portal to support various devices such as PDAs and smartphones.

## Authentication Support
- SSL VPN authentication should provide the necessary support for the organization’s current and future authentication methods and to leverage existing authentication databases. SSL VPN authentication should also be tested to ensure interoperability with existing authentication methods.

## Encryption and Integrity Protection
- Some organizations, such as Federal agencies, have strict requirements for encryption and integrity protection. SSL VPNs should support the required algorithms for symmetric encryption, key exchange, and hash functions. All cryptographic algorithms and modules must be FIPS-approved.

## Access Controls
- SSL VPNs should be evaluated to ensure they provide the level of granularity needed for access controls. Access controls should be capable of applying permissions to users, groups, and resources, as well as integrating with endpoint security controls.

## Endpoint Security Controls
- Implementation of endpoint security controls varies greatly from one SSL VPN product to another. Endpoint security should be evaluated to ensure it provides the necessary host integrity checking and security protection mechanisms for the organization.

## Intrusion Prevention Capabilities
- Not all SSL VPNs have integrated intrusion prevention capabilities. Those that do should be evaluated to ensure they do not introduce an unacceptable amount of latency into the network traffic.

## Protocol Implementation
- Several of the security services provided by SSL VPNs rely on the underlying SSL protocol. SSL VPNs may use versions of either SSL or TLS protocols. The choice of which protocol to implement depends on the data being secured. For example, TLS is approved for use in the protection of Federal information; SSL versions other than 3.1 are not. The SSL VPN must be configured to ensure that the appropriate protocols are used.# SSL VPN Overview

## Introduction
The protocol used in SSL VPNs applies to the security mechanisms that SSL and TLS use to secure communications. Not all SSL VPN products include all of these services, and there are differences in the level of sophistication of the services that are supported.

## Key Differentiators
The main differentiators for SSL VPN products are:
- Implementation of security policies
- Handling of remote clients
- Transparency of usage to the end user

### Strengths of SSL VPN
The strengths of an SSL VPN include:
- Support for a variety of systems and locations
- Granular access control
- Web browser client access
- Ease of use

## Challenges Faced by SSL VPNs
SSL VPNs, although a maturing technology, continue to face several challenges:
- Limitations on their ability to support a large number of applications and clients
- Methods of implementing network extension and endpoint security
- Ability to provide clientless access
- Use of the SSL VPN from public locations
- Product and technology education

# SSL VPN Planning and Implementation

## Overview
This section focuses on the planning and implementation of SSL VPNs in the enterprise. As with any new technology deployment, SSL VPN planning and implementation should be addressed in a phased approach. A successful SSL VPN deployment can be achieved by following a clear, step-by-step planning and implementation process.

### Phased Approach
The use of a phased approach can minimize unforeseen issues and identify potential pitfalls early in the process. This section explores in depth each of the recommended SSL VPN planning and implementation phases:

1. **Identify Requirements**
- The first phase involves identifying the current and future requirements for remote access and determining how they can best be met by an SSL VPN implementation.
- For U.S. federal agencies, this also means assessing how to comply with FIPS 140-2.

2. **Design the Solution**
- The second phase involves all aspects of designing an SSL VPN solution.
- The design elements are grouped into five categories:
- Access control
- Endpoint security
- Authentication methods
- Architecture
- Cryptography policy

3. **Implement and Test a Prototype**
- The next phase involves implementing and testing a prototype in a laboratory or test environment.
- The primary goals are to evaluate all aspects of the solution including:
- Authentication
- Application compatibility
- Management
- Logging
- Performance
- Security of the implementation
- Design and layout of the VPN portal
- Default settings

4. **Deploy the Solution**
- Once testing is completed and all issues are resolved, the next phase includes the deployment of the SSL VPN throughout the enterprise.
- This phase addresses issues specific to SSL VPNs that may occur during deployment. Support must be addressed, including the process of working with a help desk to provide assistance for end users.

5. **Manage the Solution**
- After the SSL VPN solution has been deployed, it must be managed throughout its lifecycle.
- Management includes maintenance (e.g., patching, solution expansion, key management, policy changes), performance monitoring, and periodic reviews.# Testing and Validation of SSL VPN Solutions

The handling of operational issues must also be considered. Organizations should also put into place other measures that support and complement SSL VPN implementations. These measures help to ensure that the SSL VPN solution is implemented in an environment with the technical, management, and operational controls necessary to provide sufficient security for the SSL VPN.

## Supporting Measures

Examples of supporting measures include:

- Establish and maintain control over all entry and exit points for the protected network to help ensure its integrity.
- Ensure that all SSL VPN endpoints are secured and maintained properly to reduce the risk of SSL VPN compromise or misuse.

## 4.1 Identify Requirements

The purpose of this phase is to identify which resources or services need to be available for remote access and who should be able to access them through the SSL VPN. It is also important to identify other general and application-specific requirements, such as performance, and to think about future requirements. For example, if it is likely that other resources will need to be accessible by remote users in a year, then those needs should also be considered.

One of the primary strengths of an SSL VPN architecture is its granularity of access control. An organization should leverage this feature by being specific in its identification of resources, the users who can access them, and other security requirements. It is helpful to begin this process by articulating a set of organizational requirements for remote access. These requirements are not strictly technical but are dictated by the needs of the organization. Here are a few examples of organizational requirements:

- All employees should be able to access the main corporate applications and a set of Web-based applications such as email that are all hosted on the intranet servers.
- A small group of executives should be able to access the executive file share on the administrative server.
- The sales team should have access to the sales database and the sales file share on the sales server.
- Business partners should be able to access the extranet partner server.
- Network administrators should have full access to routers, switches, and other network infrastructure (network management devices, etc.)

The next step is to determine other requirements such as anticipated performance requirements (normal and peak loads), service level agreement (SLA) guarantees, and the use of multiple languages.

The organization should consider the best possible technical solution once its requirements are identified. It is possible that other protocols such as SSH or IPsec provide a better technical solution than SSL. This is especially pertinent if a VPN solution already exists, because it could potentially be leveraged to meet the identified requirements.

See Section 6 for descriptions of such protocols and guidance on when a particular protocol may be a viable alternative to SSL. SSL may be the only option in some cases, such as when granularity on a per-application basis is required for remote access or if the VPN needs to be available to remote users without any software or hardware installation.# 4.2 SSL VPNs and FIPS 140-2 Approval

Federal agencies are required to use cryptographic algorithms that are NIST-approved and contained in FIPS-validated modules. The FIPS 140-2 specification defines how cryptographic modules will be validated. One requirement of FIPS 140 is that the module be capable of operating in a mode where all algorithms are NIST-approved. NIST-approved algorithms are specified in a FIPS (e.g., FIPS 180, Secure Hash Standard) or in a NIST Recommendation (e.g., SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography). Where there are no NIST-approved algorithms in a specific class, such as key transport, the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) Implementation Guidance may specify additional constraints.

Because SSL VPN technology employs a number of cryptographic algorithms, Federal agencies must be aware of whether their chosen SSL VPN technology is FIPS-compliant now and whether it is expected to be FIPS-compliant during the entire expected lifetime of the system. Many of the cryptographic algorithms used in some SSL cipher suites are not FIPS-approved, and therefore are not allowed for use in SSL VPNs that are to be used in applications that must conform to FIPS 140-2. This means that to be run in FIPS-compliant mode, an SSL VPN gateway must only allow cipher suites that are allowed by FIPS 140-2.

NIST SP 800-52 lists the TLS cipher suites that satisfied FIPS requirements as of its publication date (June 2005); additional cipher suites meeting FIPS requirements may become available in the future. All of the cipher suites listed in SP 800-52 will become disallowed after the end of 2010. Therefore, Federal agencies who want to provide SSL VPN services after 2010 must ensure that their systems are upgradeable to the new FIPS-compliant cipher suites before the end of 2010, and that their SSL VPN vendors guarantee that such upgrades will be available early enough for testing and deployment in the field. Further, those systems must be able to be configured to only use cipher suites with FIPS-compliant hash functions. Otherwise, a client that is offering a cipher suite with non-compliant cryptographic functions might negotiate an SSL session that does not rely on FIPS-compliant technologies.

## 4.2.1 Versions of SSL

Because of the way that SSL was designed, SSL versions 3.0 and earlier do not conform to the requirements of FIPS 140-2. Therefore, SSL VPNs that are to be used in applications that must be FIPS-compliant must use TLS 1.0 (SSL 3.1) or later for their SSL VPN systems. Further, those systems must be able to be configured to only use TLS 1.0 or later; otherwise, a client that is using SSL 3.0 or earlier might use the SSL negotiation to cause the SSL VPN gateway to create an SSL session that is inappropriate for the security level of the organization. A client that only uses SSL 3.0 or earlier should not be permitted to establish an SSL VPN connection; nevertheless, few SSL VPNs have the capability to enforce this restriction.

## 4.2.2 Key Establishment Used by SSL

NIST SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography, defines the types of key establishment algorithms that can be used in FIPS-compliant systems that use cryptography such as Diffie-Hellman.# Hellman Key Exchange

As described in NIST SP 800-52, the method for key establishment in SSL version 3.1 and later that is preferred by NIST is ephemeral Diffie-Hellman. The ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key establishment used by TLS version 1.0 and later does not meet the requirements of NIST SP 800-56A. NIST has granted a special exception from this requirement for systems using SSL until the end of 2010; see Implementation Guidance for FIPS PUB 140-2 and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program. Subject to the results of further analysis, the date may be extended. SSL’s RSA key establishment method, which is not covered by the restrictions in NIST SP 800-56A, is acceptable now and beyond 2010.

Therefore, purchasers of SSL VPNs who need to be FIPS-compliant after the end of 2010 must ensure that their SSL VPN systems can be configured to require RSA key establishment at that time. Until that time, SSL VPN systems can also use the NIST-preferred method of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.

## 4.2.3 Hash Functions Used by SSL

SSL VPN devices that are to be used in FIPS-compliant applications must also use FIPS-compliant hash functions. Plain SHA-1 can only be used until the end of 2010 in FIPS-compliant systems. The keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) form of SHA-1 is still considered secure and can be used after 2010. Since SSL VPN devices use HMAC-SHA-1, those suites that employ this hash function will remain acceptable beyond 2010.

## 4.2.4 SSL Encryption

SSL VPN devices that are to be used in FIPS-compliant applications must use FIPS-compliant encryption. Fortunately, virtually all SSL VPN devices can do this. Further, those systems must be able to be configured to only use cipher suites with FIPS-compliant encryption; otherwise, a client that is offering a cipher suite with non-compliant encryption might use the SSL negotiation to cause the SSL VPN gateway to create an SSL session that is inappropriate for the security level of the organization.

Some SSL VPN devices can be configured to only allow certain cipher suites, or at least to only allow cipher suites with certain types of encryption. Other SSL VPN devices do not allow such configuration. NIST SP 800-52 lists the types of encryption that satisfied FIPS requirements when it was published (June 2005); additional encryption algorithms meeting FIPS requirements may become available in the future.

## 4.2.5 Certificates Used During SSL Negotiations

Finally, FIPS compliance for SSL VPNs requires the use of FIPS-compliant key sizes and hash functions for signatures in the certificates used for authentication. Fortunately, virtually all SSL VPN devices are able to do this today. Further, those systems must be able to be configured to only use FIPS-compliant key sizes and hash functions in these certificates; otherwise, a client or server whose certificate uses a non-compliant key size or hash function might use the SSL negotiation to cause the SSL VPN gateway to create an SSL session that is inappropriate for the security level of the organization.

Note that the list of allowed hash functions will change at the end of 2010.# SSL VPN Compliance and Design Considerations

## Introduction
After a certain time, server certificates that use the SHA-1 hash function will no longer be allowed. All FIPS-compliant SSL VPN devices will need to use certificates that utilize the SHA-256 hash function.

## Current Limitations
- Some SSL VPN devices today cannot use SHA-256 certificates as the server authenticating certificate.
- Not all web browsers support SHA-256 certificates for authentication.

## Signature Schemes
SSL server authentication certificates can use either the RSA or DSS signature schemes. However, many SSL VPN systems and most web browsers primarily support RSA.

### DSA Certificates
- If a server authenticates itself with a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) certificate, the key negotiation must use the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman method.
- This method is not allowed after the end of 2010, meaning SSL VPN systems using DSA certificates cannot be used post-2010 unless an exception for ephemeral Diffie-Hellman is extended.
- For DSA, a FIPS 186-3 compliant digital signature is required for larger key sizes.

## Compliance Challenges
Currently, few (if any) SSL VPN gateways can be configured to reject certificates based on the size of the key used. Consequently, most can operate in FIPS-noncompliant modes without any means to prevent such use.

### Logging and Auditing
- Few SSL VPN gateways log the size of the key used in certificate authentication, making it impossible to audit FIPS compliance.
- Similarly, few SSL VPN browsers can reject server certificates based on key size, allowing for FIPS-noncompliant modes.

## Ensuring FIPS Compliance
To guarantee FIPS compliance, SSL VPNs that cannot enforce specific key sizes should be configured with the following settings:

1. The server certificate used for authenticating the SSL VPN device to clients must have an appropriate-length key.
2. One of the following steps must be performed:
- The SSL VPN gateway must be configured to only validate client certificates that have a certificate policy enforcing the key size requirement.
- The SSL VPN gateway must validate client certificates from a preapproved list, allowing key size validation at the time of client certificate registration.
- The use of client certificates for authentication to the SSL VPN gateway must be disabled. Instead, a smartcard or token should be used. If that is not possible, a username and password may be used as a last resort, though this is discouraged.

## Key Length Changes
It is important to note that the minimum FIPS-compliant key length for DSA and RSA certificates will change at the end of 2010 from 1024 bits to 2048 bits. For more information, refer to the Implementation Guidance for FIPS PUB 140-2 and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program.

## 4.3 Design the Solution
Once the requirements have been identified and it has been determined that an SSL VPN is the best solution, the next phase is to design a solution that meets the specified requirements. This phase is broken into five major components, which are described in more detail in the following subsections.# SSL VPN Implementation Guide

## Access Control
Design the access control policy. SSL VPN users may gain access to particular resources based on characteristics such as user identification, computer type and location, and the method of authentication.

## Endpoint Security
Design the endpoint security controls. SSL VPNs provide endpoint security controls that include host integrity checking and security protection mechanisms. Host integrity checks ensure that the client system is in compliance with an organization’s minimum security policy. Typical host integrity checks may look for operating system type and version, antivirus and personal firewall status and configurations, or a specific file, registry key, or process that is running.

## Authentication
Select the authentication methods. There are many ways to authenticate SSL VPN users, including LDAP, RADIUS, Active Directory, and digital certificates.

## Architecture
Designing the architecture of the SSL VPN implementation includes hardware selection, device placement, firewall and routing considerations, client software selection, high availability configuration, and portal design.

## Cryptography Policy and FIPS Compliance
The organization must choose a cryptography policy that fits its needs and is compliant with its requirements. In addition, Federal agencies must use only cryptographic modules that have algorithms and methods that are compliant with the FIPS 140-2 specification.

### 4.3.1 Design the Access Control Policy
After the organization determines what resources will be accessible and by whom, the next step is to design the access control policy. The organization should base this policy on the organizational requirements that were identified in the Identify Requirements phase. These requirements stipulate which resources should be accessed by which groups or individuals. The access control policy could provide additional requirements and make access to resources dependent on other characteristics such as the authentication method used, computer type and location, and user identification.

The four major steps in designing an access control policy are as follows:

1. **List the resources** that will be accessed through the SSL VPN. A resource is as specific as a single application on one server or as general as an enterprise-wide service such as email or all internal Web sites. Resources can be treated separately or grouped together. For example, one specific human resources application can be listed by itself or grouped with a collection of other human resources applications. A resource can be a member of more than one group, but grouping in this way should not be used extensively because security holes or other problems can be created. For example, if Application X is a member of Groups A and B, a user that is granted access to Group A but denied access to Group B may still have access to Application X.

2. **List the groups or users.** An access control policy is much more manageable if users are assigned primarily to groups. A user can be a member of more than one group. For example, an executive is a member of the Executive and Employee groups, and a salesperson is...# Access Control and VPN Usage

## 1. Group Membership
A member of the Sales and Employee groups.

## 2. Conditions for Resource Accessibility
List the conditions under which the resources should be accessible by the groups. Conditions are based on the ability of endpoint security controls to perform host integrity checking on the client hosts.

### Host Integrity Checking
Host integrity checking, which is discussed in more detail in Section 4.3.2, involves performing checks on conditions, including:
- The type of operating system on the client machine
- The presence of a firewall or antivirus scanner
- Registry settings
- Authentication method used
- Time of day

These conditions will help determine what resources are accessible by the user. For example, users logging in from an organization-managed host would have access to more resources than if they were to log in from a public system at an Internet café.

## 3. VPN Usage for Resource Access
List how the VPN should be used to access the resources. As mentioned in Section 3.2, there are three main components to SSL VPNs:
- Proxying
- Application translation
- Network extension

### Proxying
Proxying is most often used to provide secure access to websites.

### Application Translation
Application translation uses proxying to translate an application into a format that is web-enabled and accessible through a browser.

### Network Extension
Network extension provides broad access to the internal network. The organization should decide how each resource should be accessed through the VPN. Proxying and application translation offer the most restrictive access because all communication takes place through the browser interface. Network extension is the easiest to use because users have full network access, but it should be used with discretion for this reason.

#### Port Forwarding
A limited type of network extension, port forwarding, is sometimes used instead of full network extension. Port forwarding only creates tunnels for certain TCP or UDP ports instead of for all ports at one time. For example, a port forwarding system might tunnel HTTP traffic but not DNS traffic, leaving the DNS traffic outside of the VPN. Because port forwarding technology is a subset of network extension, this document discusses only network extension.

### Packet Filtering
Most SSL VPN devices offer packet filtering for users that access resources via network extension. Because network extension provides broad access to users, the most effective way to protect certain subnets may be to configure packet filters that prevent access to them. SSL VPN devices may also support multiple routing tables for users. One routing table can be used to provide access to all internal subnets, while another routing table enables connectivity to subnets that only specific groups should access.

## 4. Example Access Control Requirements
The following is an example of an organization’s access control requirements. The organizational requirements listed in the Identify Requirements phase are repeated here as a reminder:
- All employees should be able to access the main corporate applications and a set of web-based applications such as email that are all hosted on the intranet servers.
- A small group of executives should be able to access the executive file share.# Access Control Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the access control policy for various resources within the organization, specifying which groups have access to which resources and under what conditions.

## Resource Access

### Resources Accessible via SSL VPN
- Corporate applications on intranet servers (grouped together)
- Web applications—email and calendaring (grouped together)
- Executive file share on administrative server
- Sales database
- Sales file share on sales server
- Extranet partner server
- Network infrastructure devices (grouped together)

### Groups with Access
- Employees
- Executives
- Sales
- Business partners
- Administrators

## Access Conditions

### General Conditions
- All employees should be able to access the main enterprise applications on the intranet servers from organization-managed hosts. An organization-managed host has a firewall, antivirus software, and a registry key indicating that it is managed by the organization.
- When these same users log in from any other host, such as a PC at a kiosk or in an Internet café, they should be able to access only a limited set of Web-based applications such as email and calendaring.
- If the host is running a Windows operating system, it must be using one or more specific versions of Windows, with each specific version using the most current set of updates.

### Executive Access
- Executives have the same access rights as other employees, as well as access to the executive file share on the administrative server. This access is only granted from organization-managed hosts.

### Sales Group Access
- Members of the sales group have the same access rights as other employees. Additionally, they should have full access to the sales database and the sales file share on the sales server when using their own organization-managed hosts. From other hosts, they can only access the sales file share.

### Business Partner Access
- Business partners should be able to access the extranet partner server from specified IP addresses only, Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern time.

### Network Administrator Access
- Network administrators should have access to a range of subnets assigned to network infrastructure devices. This access is granted only when they are using their organization-managed hosts.

## Note
These conditions are not mutually exclusive and can be fulfilled simultaneously. For example, a user who logs in from an organization-managed host also satisfies the "any host" condition.

## Access Types
The organization has decided to use the following access types for the various resources:
- The corporate applications are accessible by network extension due to the broad number of them on multiple servers. Access to routers, switches, and other network infrastructure is also included.# Access Control and Endpoint Security Policy

## Access Control Policy

- **Network Extension**: Accessible through network extension. Packet filtering is used to limit access to specific application servers.
- **Web Applications**: Accessible by proxy because they are already available via Web browser.
- **Executive File Share**: Accessible by proxying so that executives can use the file share in the same fashion whether connecting remotely or internally.
- **Sales Database**: Accessible by proxying because database administrators require direct access to the database server. The application is therefore not able to be translated.
- **File Shares**: Both the sales file share and file shares on the extranet partner server are made accessible by translation, where all file sharing takes place in a Web browser.

### Resource Access Conditions

Table 4-1 shows the resources and groups listed with conditions for access. Users are added to various groups to grant them access to resources via the SSL VPN. For example:

- Regular employees are added to the **Employees** group.
- Executives are added to both the **Executives** and **Employees** groups.

A user in the Employees group who logs in from an organization-managed host is granted access to both corporate applications and Web applications resources. This same user is restricted to only Web applications if the host cannot be verified as organization-managed.

### Executive File Share Access

Note that the access policy is configured to restrict access to the executive file share only to users who belong to the **Executives** group and are logging in from an organization-managed host. An executive is only given the access privileges of a regular employee if he or she logs in from any other host. If desired, users could also use a different authentication method to receive access to the executive file share.

This access control policy assumes that a user can satisfy multiple conditions simultaneously. For example, a user who logs in from an organization-managed host also satisfies the any host condition and is granted access to the corresponding resources. If the SSL VPN device cannot support this flexibility, then the organization would have to specify the resources for each condition.

## Endpoint Security Policy

### Designing the Endpoint Security Policy

Once the organization designs its access control policy, it should consider constructing a policy to enforce endpoint security. Such a policy could initially verify that a client host complies with an organization’s security policy by requiring host integrity checks to be performed on the client host.

It is recommended to run the checks before the login process to look for malware such as keystroke loggers or viruses. The checks can prohibit login altogether if the client host does not comply with the organization’s minimum security policy.

For example, the organization’s endpoint security policy may specify that desktop search tools that index the contents of a user’s hard drive are prohibited during an SSL VPN session because these tools can cache data from the session. If this is the case, then the host integrity checking process may either turn off the search tools directly or prevent login until the tools are explicitly turned off by the user.

### Host Integrity Checks

Some SSL VPN vendors perform the host integrity checks by having the client host dynamically download active content from the SSL VPN device and then execute the active content. In this case, the process ensures that the client host meets the necessary security standards before granting access.# Endpoint Security Policy for SSL VPN

## Introduction
Client operating systems and browsers need to be configured to permit agents to be downloaded and executed; otherwise, the client could perceive the agents as malware and block them, preventing the SSL VPN from performing the host integrity checks. This shows a basic conundrum of using this type of integrity check: some organizations prohibit such active content from being run in browsers because it is difficult to distinguish it from malware.

## Endpoint Security Policy
An endpoint security policy should also specify how to enforce endpoint security on a client system after the user has logged out. Security protection mechanisms such as a cache cleaner can be activated during the logout process to remove data that was cached or saved during the SSL VPN session.

### Virtual Storage Space
For even higher security, some SSL VPN vendors offer the capability of putting the session into a virtual storage space. The SSL VPN device allocates temporary memory and hard drive space for it. On a Windows machine, the virtual storage space may consist of temporary My Documents and Desktop directories. The user is not able to save anything to a directory outside of the virtual storage space. After the user logs out, the entire virtual storage space and all data downloaded during the session is erased. This virtual space may also be encrypted for greater security.

### Compatibility and Policy Decisions
Not all applications may be compatible with the virtual storage space because some of the user’s directories are temporarily replaced, and interoperability problems could result. Additionally, the organization will have to make a policy decision about when to put users into the virtual storage space. For example, it may make sense to allow users to access their entire hard drive and keep downloaded files or email attachments if they are logging into the SSL VPN from their own organization-managed hosts.

## Automatic Logout
If a user forgets to log out, the SSL VPN device should be able to perform an automatic logout after a specific period of inactivity. Ideally, the device could detect and ignore activity that is automatic, such as an email client that periodically connects to the mail server or automatic refresh requests by a web browser. The device may also have a separate timeout threshold to require re-authentication regardless of inactivity. This timeout limits the damage that is done if a malicious user somehow gets control of the VPN session. Some SSL VPN devices may have different timeout thresholds for different types of users. For example, users who are put into a virtual storage space might have much shorter timeout thresholds than users who log in from an organization-managed machine.

## Example of an Endpoint Security Policy
The following is an example of an endpoint security policy that is based on the access control policy described in the previous section. The access control policy is based on a user’s host meeting one of three conditions: organization-managed host, any host, or correct IP address and time:

- **Organization-managed host**: An organization-managed host has a firewall, antivirus software, and a registry key indicating that it is managed by the organization.

- **Any host**: If users are not using their organization-managed hosts to access resources, they can still use any host, but with more restricted access. The only requirement for the any host condition is that if it is running a Windows operating system, it is using one or more specific versions of Windows.# Endpoint Security Policy and Authentication Methods

## Overview
The endpoint security policy is based on the access control policy and elaborates on host integrity checking and the post-login process.

## Access Control
- **IP Address and Time Restrictions**: Business partners can only access their assigned resources from specified IP addresses on Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern time.

## Host Integrity Checking
- **Organization-Managed Hosts**:
- Must be currently running a firewall.
- For specific versions of Windows, if there is no firewall running, the built-in Windows Firewall will automatically be enabled.
- An antivirus software program certified by the organization must be currently running and use a signature database that is out of date by no more than one week.
- The registry key is installed by the organization’s information technology (IT) group either when the host is first configured or afterward by user request.
- Users are permitted to keep all cookies, Web browser cache entries, and downloaded files and attachments.
- Desktop search tools are automatically disabled at login.

- **Non-Organization Managed Hosts**:
- Permitted to access the SSL VPN but must run one or more specific versions of Windows, with each specific version using the most current set of updates.
- After login, a user’s session is established in a virtual storage space so that all data stored during the session can be erased afterward.
- Desktop search tools are automatically disabled at login.

- **Business Partners**:
- Do not need to run any firewall or antivirus software.
- Access is based on the client host’s IP address and the current time of day.
- Users’ sessions are not put into the virtual storage space, but all browser-related data is erased after the user logs out.
- Downloaded files or attachments are not erased.
- Desktop search tools are automatically disabled at login.

## SSL VPN Device Deployment
If an organization has an endpoint security policy, it should deploy SSL VPN devices that can support those policies. This is especially important because endpoint security controls vary widely by device and vendor. Each organization should conduct testing during its evaluation process to determine the endpoint security capabilities of each device being considered.

## Authentication Methods
### Selecting Authentication Methods
After determining how resources are to be accessed and how access control and endpoint security are to be enforced, the next step is to decide on an authentication scheme for clients. The organization should choose a scheme consistent with its security policy.

- **Two-Factor Authentication**: If two-factor authentication is already required in the enterprise, it should also be used for SSL VPN client authentication. The flexible nature of SSL VPNs may require further elaboration in policy.

- **Digital Certificates**: Authentication based on digital certificates requires each host to have a certificate installed. The organization will have to decide what type of access to permit from hosts that do not have certificates, such as hosts owned by employees or public computers. An organization might not want to allow its certificates to be installed or used on hosts that are not managed by the organization.# SSL VPN Authentication Methods

## Overview
In the case of public computers, even certificates that are stored on an external device may not work, since many public computers have their USB ports blocked to prevent the unauthorized installation of malware.

## Leveraging Existing Authentication Infrastructures
Existing external authentication infrastructures should also be leveraged if feasible. Many SSL VPN products support LDAP, RADIUS, and Active Directory, allowing configuration to access authentication servers using any of these options. The authentication server can provide group information for authenticated users, such as whether a user belongs to the Sales or Executives group, enabling the SSL VPN device to enforce the organization’s access control policy.

## Individual and Group Authentication Methods
SSL VPN authentication methods may be applied on an individual or group basis. This feature enables an organization to choose one form of authentication for one group, such as the Employees group, and another form of authentication for another group, such as the Executives group. The organization may also choose to base the authentication method on specific resources, with some resources requiring stronger authentication than others.

### Example Authentication Methods
Table 4-2 illustrates sample authentication methods for the resources defined in the previous example. Access to the executive file share, sales database, and network infrastructure is considered especially sensitive, requiring two-factor authentication where the user must also use a physical token to be authenticated to the resource.

## SSL VPN Product Capabilities
Various SSL VPN products can use internal databases, combine external authentication servers with an internal database stored on the SSL VPN device itself, or just use external authentication. Either the SSL VPN database or the authentication server database can contain user-specific information, such as preferences for portal settings and bookmarks for websites. For ease of management, user information should be stored on the external authentication server whenever possible to reduce the amount of duplicated information, which can get out of sync.

## Server Authentication Options
In addition to user authentication, the organization should also evaluate different server authentication options. The SSL VPN device requires an SSL server certificate to authenticate itself to clients. The organization can:

- Purchase a server certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA)
- Have the server certificate signed by its own CA if it already has a public key infrastructure (PKI) in place
- Use a self-signed certificate

A user validates the credentials of the SSL VPN device by decrypting the certificate with the issuer’s public key and possibly chaining to a trust anchor such as the trusted CA. The type and issuer of the server certificate may determine whether users from other organizations can access the VPN.

## Product Selection and Testing
Because integration with authentication servers is an area where SSL VPN products vary greatly, an organization should ensure that whatever product it chooses is able to support its authentication requirements. Any potential products should also be tested with the existing authentication servers to verify interoperability.

## 4.3.4 Design the Architecture# SSL VPN Implementation Architecture

The architecture of the SSL VPN implementation refers to the selection of devices and software to provide SSL VPN services and the placement of SSL VPN devices within the existing network infrastructure. This section focuses on specific recommendations such as selection of hardware configuration, device placement and firewall configuration, routing policy and other network considerations, high availability or load balancing support, device management, client software selection, and portal design.

## 4.3.4.1 Selection of Hardware Configuration

A key decision to be made for the SSL VPN implementation is the type of hardware configuration to use for the SSL VPN device. There are three main types of hardware configuration:

1. **Hardware Appliance**:
- A device running the SSL VPN software that has been hardened by the SSL VPN device vendor to make it more secure.
- For example, unnecessary services and programs have been removed from the operating system, and various default settings have been changed.
- The hardware appliance is the most common type of SSL VPN device on the market today.
- Some SSL VPN appliances have accelerator options that offload SSL processing so the appliance can process more user requests. These accelerators are either external devices or cards that are installed in the SSL VPN appliance. An organization with high performance requirements should consider these options.

2. **Upgrade to Existing Security Products**:
- Some existing security products such as firewalls or IPsec VPN gateways can be upgraded to support SSL VPNs.
- This option is made available by the vendor as either a software upgrade or a hardware module that is installed into the existing security device.

3. **Software Solution**:
- A software solution is software that is installed on standard hardware, such as a server built by the organization.
- The hardware can either be used to support a dedicated SSL VPN service or to support other services such as a firewall or IPsec VPN.

## 4.3.4.2 Device Placement and Firewall Configuration

Device placement of the SSL VPN hardware is often a challenging task because the placement has security, functionality, and performance implications. It may also have an effect on other network devices such as firewalls, routers, and switches. Incorporating an SSL VPN device into a network architecture requires strong overall knowledge of network and security policy.

It is important to understand that the cryptographic protection of the SSL VPN only extends from client machines to the SSL VPN device. After the device receives the traffic from users, it is decrypted and forwarded in its original form to the destination. So if client traffic is originally sent in plaintext before it is encrypted with SSL, it is sent in plaintext from the VPN device to its destination. The SSL VPN device preserves most of the fields in the packet headers, with the exception of the source IP address and source TCP or UDP port.

There are three main options for SSL VPN device placement:
- As part of the organization’s firewall
- Within the internal network
- Within a demilitarized zone (DMZ)# VPN Device Placement and Firewall Considerations

## Introduction
When integrating VPN functionality with firewalls, it is crucial to understand the implications of device placement and the associated advantages and disadvantages.

## Enabling VPN Functionality on the Firewall
This design integrates the firewall and SSL VPN device. The most common scenario is for an existing firewall product to be upgraded to support SSL VPNs. This option is made available by the vendor as either a software upgrade or hardware add-on.

### Configuration Requirements
- TCP port 443 for the firewall’s external address must be opened to permit users to initiate SSL VPN connections.
- The firewall/SSL VPN device then communicates directly with internal hosts.

### Advantages
- **No Holes in Firewall**: Holes do not need to be opened in the firewall between an external SSL VPN device and the internal network.
- **Traffic Control**: Traffic between the device and the internal network must go through the firewall, ensuring it is subject to the firewall’s policies.
- **Simplified Administration**: Network design and system administration are simpler because there are no additional devices to manage.

### Disadvantages
- **Vendor Limitations**: The organization is limited to the VPN functionality offered by its firewall vendor, lacking the option of using a separate VPN appliance.
- **Increased Vulnerability**: The firewall is directly accessible by external users on TCP port 443, increasing the likelihood of vulnerabilities being exploited.
- **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Augmenting the firewall with SSL VPN functionality could introduce potential vulnerabilities.

## Placing the VPN Device in the Internal Network
This option places the VPN device entirely within the internal network behind the firewall. TCP port 443 for the address of the SSL VPN must be opened in the firewall to access the device.

### Recommended Configuration
- It is highly recommended to place an additional firewall between the SSL VPN device and the rest of the internal network to ensure both front-end and back-end protection.

### Advantages
- **Single Rule Addition**: Only a single rule for a single address needs to be added to the firewall.
- **Internal Device Security**: The device is internal, so no holes need to be opened in the firewall between the device and internal hosts.
- **Protected Traffic**: Traffic between the device and the internal network is behind the firewall, protecting it from sniffing or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) attacks by machines in the DMZ.

### Disadvantages
- **Bypassing Firewall Protection**: VPN traffic bypasses the firewall entirely because all applications are tunneled through the SSL connection. This means that the firewall offers no protection from malicious traffic sent through the VPN. Instead, the VPN device must provide this protection through a packet filter or other means.# VPN Device Placement and Security Considerations

## Introduction
The placement of SSL VPN devices within a network can significantly impact security. This document discusses the implications of placing a VPN device in the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) and the associated advantages and disadvantages.

## Unsolicited Traffic Risks
- Unsolicited traffic can now be sent from the outside into the internal network, specifically to the SSL VPN device. This behavior violates some corporate security policies.
- If the SSL VPN device is compromised, the attacker could gain access to the internal network. This risk also applies if the firewall itself is compromised.

## VPN Device Placement in the DMZ
Placing the VPN device within the DMZ protects traffic between the device and internal hosts, as well as the device itself from external attacks. The only port that must be opened in the firewall to access the device is TCP port 443 (HTTPS).

### Network Design
Figure 4-3 illustrates an example of a network design where the VPN device is placed in the DMZ. The DMZ is a network segment attached to a firewall interface. Although not shown in the diagram, it is highly recommended to place an additional firewall between the SSL VPN device and the internal network. This ensures both front-end and back-end protection for the SSL VPN device.

### Alternate Approach: Two-DMZ Architecture
An alternate approach is a two-DMZ architecture, placing the SSL VPN device, front- and back-ended by a firewall, on a separate DMZ segment. This approach has some advantages and disadvantages compared to other options.

#### Advantages
- **Limited Access**: Compromise of the device does not necessarily mean that the attacker has full access to the internal network.
- **Firewall Policies**: Traffic between the device and the internal network must go through the firewall, ensuring it is subject to the firewall’s policies.
- **Intrusion Detection**: An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) within the DMZ can analyze traffic destined for the internal network for malicious activity.

#### Disadvantages
- **Port Management**: Numerous ports from the device to internal hosts must be opened in the firewall. User traffic from the VPN device will only reach internal hosts if these holes are opened. An attacker that compromises the VPN device will have access to the internal network through these holes.
- **Cleartext Vulnerability**: Decrypted traffic from the device to the internal network must be sent in cleartext through the DMZ network, making it vulnerable to sniffing or ARP attacks by other machines in the DMZ that could be compromised by attackers.
- **Bypassing Firewall**: The firewall is bypassed when user traffic is destined for hosts in the DMZ, assuming that clients use the VPN device to reach these DMZ hosts and do not use a split tunnel configuration.

## Recommended Configuration
If the VPN device is placed in the DMZ, it should be configured with two interfaces:
- **External Interface**: Remote users use this interface to connect to the device.
- **Internal Interface**: Traffic destined for the internal network traverses this interface, which is connected to either another firewall or another interface on the same firewall.

### Conclusion
This approach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages compared to other options, and careful consideration should be given to the specific network environment and security policies in place.# Advantages and Disadvantages of Placing a VPN Device in the DMZ

## Advantages
- All of the previously mentioned advantages of placing the device in the DMZ still apply.
- The unencrypted traffic headed for internal hosts is protected from sniffing or ARP attacks from other hosts in the DMZ.
- Only the firewall interface connected to the device’s internal interface must be configured to permit traffic from the VPN device. An intruder who compromises another host in the DMZ cannot use this internal interface to access the internal network unless the VPN device is compromised too.

## Disadvantages
- Holes need to be opened in the firewall between the SSL VPN device and internal hosts.
- The firewall is bypassed when split tunneling is not used and user traffic is destined for hosts in the DMZ. Possible solutions include turning on split tunneling, putting a firewall between DMZ hosts and the VPN device, and configuring packet filtering on a router connecting the DMZ hosts to the VPN device.
- Using a second interface on the VPN device may introduce additional routing complexity.

If the organization decides to place the VPN device within the DMZ, it must decide how many holes to open in its firewall between the device and the internal network. If the organization must support many services through the SSL VPN, then it may decide to completely open up all connectivity between the VPN device and the internal network. This enables VPN users to access any machine and port internally. The benefits of such an approach will have to be weighed against the costs of potential security issues.

## 4.3.4.3 Routing Policy and Other Network Considerations
Routing policy is as important as firewall configuration. Packets must be routed correctly within the internal network for the VPN to function properly. When the VPN components of proxying and application translation are used, routing is fairly straightforward. Packets from the VPN device that are destined for the internal network have the source address of the VPN device itself. As long as the VPN device’s source address is routable in the internal network, packets will be correctly routed from internal hosts back to the VPN device.

If network extension is used, routing becomes more complicated. Network extension creates a point-to-point tunnel interface between the client machine and the VPN device. Each end of the tunnel is assigned a virtual IP address. The client’s virtual IP address is used as the source address of VPN packets from the client machine. Even after traffic from the client machine reaches the VPN device and is taken out of the SSL tunnel, the source address remains the same. This means that internal hosts must know how to route the client’s virtual IP address back to the VPN device, or routing will not work correctly.

For example, a client establishes a VPN connection using network extension. It receives the address of 192.168.1.200. The VPN device receives 192.168.1.1 for its virtual tunnel interface. When the VPN device forwards packets from the client to internal hosts, these internal hosts will receive packets with a...# VPN Client Communication and Network Configuration

## Source Addressing and Routing

The source address of the VPN client (e.g., 192.168.1.200) is crucial for internal communication. If the internal routers cannot route packets back to the VPN device, the client will be unable to communicate with any internal hosts.

### Network Address Translation (NAT)

An alternative approach is to use Network Address Translation (NAT) for clients utilizing network extension. When NAT is employed, all packets forwarded from the VPN device to the internal network are assigned the source address of the VPN device. This allows the routing configuration to remain unchanged, as it is assumed that internal hosts can already route traffic to the VPN device.

#### Disadvantages of NAT

However, this approach has its disadvantages. The primary concern is that tracking the network activity of VPN clients by IP address becomes impossible, as all clients share a single address. For this reason, it is recommended that NAT not be used for clients using network extension.

## Split Tunneling

Another issue that must be addressed with network extension is split tunneling.

### Definition

Split tunneling is defined as the process that allows a remote VPN user to access a public network (most commonly the Internet) while simultaneously accessing resources on the VPN. A client machine that establishes a split tunnel connection with the VPN device does not send all of its network traffic through the VPN tunnel. Instead, it sends all traffic not destined for the internal (protected) network through its standard network connection and only sends traffic destined for the internal network through the VPN tunnel.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

Split tunneling offers advantages such as efficiency and bandwidth conservation, as traffic destined for the Internet does not have to be sent first to the VPN device. However, it also creates potential security vulnerabilities. If an attacker from the Internet compromises the client machine, they can use the split tunnel to access the organization’s internal network. Organizations must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of split tunneling before deciding to implement it.

### Configuration Considerations

If split tunneling is implemented, the organization must decide which IP addresses will be routed through the split tunnel. If all of an organization’s IP addresses are assigned to internal hosts, routing is straightforward. However, some hosts may be in the DMZ and publicly accessible. Traffic destined for these DMZ hosts will bypass the firewall if split tunneling is not used. It may be more secure and efficient for the client to reach hosts located in the DMZ via the Internet rather than using the split tunnel. In such cases, the organization must configure the split tunnel with internal subnets only.

## VPN Device Configuration in the DMZ

Section 4.3.4.2 recommends that a VPN device placed in the DMZ be configured with at least two interfaces: one for external traffic and one for internal traffic. However, using two interfaces introduces more routing complexity.

### Routing Complexity

The device needs to be configured with static routes that correctly point toward internal hosts or hosts in the DMZ. The routing tables for routers within the DMZ must also be configured to route all traffic destined for both interfaces on the device toward the device’s external interface. If any traffic is routed toward the device’s internal interface, it may get dropped because it must traverse a firewall to reach the internal interface.# Firewall and VPN Traffic Management

## Overview
The firewall will have no knowledge of the traffic because the original traffic from the VPN device to the DMZ hosts traversed the device’s external interface and therefore did not go through the firewall.

!Traffic Management Scenario

## Multiple Sites Considerations
One final consideration for overall network policy is the issue of multiple sites. If the organization wants multiple sites to support SSL VPN services, then it must decide how to configure authentication and routing. There are several possibilities:

### Site-Specific Authentication
- Each site has an SSL VPN device, but users can only authenticate to the device at their local site. If there is a network between sites, then users can use the SSL VPN to access those other sites.

### Single Site Authentication
- Users can authenticate to a device at any of the sites but not simultaneously. For example, if there are two sites, Site A and Site B, users cannot establish VPN connections to both sites at the same time. All internal traffic must go to either Site A or Site B. Once users are authenticated, their traffic is sent to a single site and then traverses the internal network if necessary to access the other sites. This configuration could be used for backup purposes, allowing a user who normally connects to Site A to create a Site B VPN if the Site A VPN architecture is inaccessible.

### Simultaneous Site Authentication
- Users can authenticate to all sites simultaneously. Each user’s routing table is configured so that packets destined for a specific site’s addresses will take that site’s VPN connection. If a user creates VPNs to Sites A and B simultaneously, then packets destined for a Site A subnet traverse the VPN to Site A, with the same applying to packets destined for a Site B subnet.

### Routing Considerations
Note that the routing issues mentioned earlier in this section are also relevant for an architecture with multiple sites. Each site must ensure correct routing and not block VPN packets with addresses assigned at other sites. If the VPN devices have multiple interfaces, packets destined for the external interface may have to be routed differently from packets destined for the internal interface, depending on how the internal connectivity between sites is configured.

## High Availability or Load Balancing Support
An organization may decide to implement high availability or load balancing. High availability may be required to meet service level agreements (SLA) for guaranteed uptime, or load balancing may be required to support a large number of users. SSL VPN products vary widely in how they support high availability and load balancing.

### Evaluation Questions
For this reason, an organization with a need for high availability or load balancing should answer at least these questions about each device under evaluation, with testing possibly being required to receive detailed answers:
- **Does the device employ an active/passive or an active/active mode architecture?**
- An active/passive architecture only supports one active device at a time, while an active/active architecture supports two devices simultaneously. Active/passive systems are much easier to design and are therefore usually less expensive than active/active systems. Active/active systems are mostly useful in architectures requiring higher redundancy and load distribution.# SSL VPN Management and Configuration

## High Load Scenarios
- Where a very high load is expected, more than one device needs to be active under normal circumstances.

## State Information Maintenance
- **Failure Scenarios**:
- How is state information maintained across devices in a failure scenario?
- How long does the failover process take for proxying, translation, and network extension?

- **Active/Active Mode Architecture**:
- Is state information for all sessions mirrored across all devices so a device failure will not disrupt any user sessions?
- Does each device track state information (such as user authentication status) only for its own sessions, which may require reauthentication upon device failure?

- **External Load Balancing**:
- If an external load balancing solution is used, how is state information maintained throughout the architecture?

## Configuration and Upgrading
- Configuration and upgrading pose additional issues:
- Some devices mirror configuration settings across devices, so only the active devices should be configured. Any altered settings on the passive devices will quickly be overwritten by the active device’s settings.
- If configuration settings are not mirrored, all devices should be configured with identical settings at the same time.

- **Upgrading Procedures**:
- The vendor’s instructions for upgrading should be followed.
- Some vendors require the passive device in an active/passive mode architecture to be upgraded first. After this upgrade is complete, the newly upgraded device becomes active, and the newly passive device can then be upgraded.
- Other vendors require the active device to be upgraded first. The active device continues to handle VPN traffic while being upgraded and only fails over to the passive device when it is ready to reboot with the new upgrade in place.
- Upgrading the active device first avoids scenarios where the passive device is being upgraded and receives mirrored configuration changes from the active device during the upgrade process.

## Management Policy
- The organization should design a management policy to determine who will manage the SSL VPN device and by what means.
- Some devices offer a partitioned or delegated management feature that allows different aspects of the device to be managed by different groups or individuals. For example, a group that manages IT for the sales department can control access control and endpoint security policies for sales resources only. System administrators can manage endpoint security regarding the type and number of patches that each client machine must have installed.

- **Administrative Access**:
- If multiple interfaces on the SSL VPN device are used, the management policy should specify which interface permits administrative access.
- Some devices provide flexibility in selectively enabling administrative access on each interface, as well as permitting this access only from specific IP addresses.
- Various forms of authentication for administrative access may also be supported, such as smart cards and two-factor authentication.
- If the organization is using multiple interfaces, administrative access is commonly only configured on the interface connected to the internal network for security reasons (although allowing management from the external interface over an SSL-protected tunnel is also considered secure).# SSL VPN Management and Configuration

## 4.3.4.6 Client Software Selection
Although SSL VPNs are described as clientless, some forms of SSL VPN access, such as network extension, require dynamically downloaded agents to be run on the host. Even before login, the client machine may have to execute a dynamically downloaded agent that performs host integrity checks. The organization will have to ensure that these agents can run on client machines if the agents are required by access control and endpoint security policies.

Once logged in, users can use common web browsers to access the SSL VPN via proxy, but network extension requires particular browsers or versions of those browsers because they require other downloadable agents that establish the virtual network connection. If some systems, such as public kiosks, cannot download and execute these dynamically downloadable agents, then the organization will have to make a decision about the level of access to offer to these machines. Many SSL portal VPNs will work from all common web browsers, but many SSL tunnel VPNs require particular browsers and specific versions of those browsers.

## 4.3.4.7 Portal Design
The organization should provide a portal for users so they can log in to the SSL VPN and gain access to internal resources. The portal can either be supplied by the SSL VPN device vendor or developed by the organization itself. If the organization chooses to use the portal supplied by the SSL VPN device vendor, it can customize it to match the appearance of the organization’s intranet.

Portal customization features vary widely by device, but the organization should be able to alter graphics, colors, and possibly icons and the layout of the portal. The functionality of the portal will depend on the type of access to the SSL VPN. For example, resources that rely on proxying and application translation will require some sort of icon or hyperlink in the portal so users can access them. Access via network extension also requires a hyperlink or icon on the portal to initiate the network extension process.

Once this takes place, however, the portal is not required to access resources because the client machine has direct access to these resources via the network extension. An organization’s access control policy could determine the hyperlinks or icons that are displayed in the portal. For example, if the access control policy prohibits a user from using network extension, then the hyperlink or icon enabling network extension should not be displayed.

*Figure 4-6 depicts an example of a generic SSL VPN portal interface.*

## 4.3.5 Cryptography Policy and FIPS Compliance
The organization should choose a cryptography policy that fits its needs and is...# Compliance and Design Considerations for SSL VPNs

## 4.3.6 Other Design Decisions

In addition to what has already been discussed in this section, there are other possible design considerations. The following items describe issues not addressed earlier:

### IPv6
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has mandated that all Federal government agencies must migrate their network backbones to support Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) by June 2008. If the organization is planning a migration to IPv6 in the near future for compliance with this mandate or for any other reason, it should deploy an SSL VPN solution that is compliant with IPv6.

There is currently no official definition of “IPv6 compliance” from a Federal government perspective. It is therefore important to verify the specific functionality of an IPv6-compliant SSL VPN device as well as of all Web browsers that will connect to the SSL VPN. For example, an organization should verify if the SSL VPN device can serve as a reverse proxy for IPv6 applications and assign IPv6 addresses to network extension clients, or if it just passes IPv6 packets through.

### Incident Response
Organizations should consider how SSL VPN components may be affected by security-related incidents and create a design that supports effective and efficient incident response activities. For example, if an SSL VPN user’s system is compromised, this should necessitate disabling the user’s SSL VPN account.

### Log Management
Many organizations have security logging policies. SSL VPN devices should be configured so they log sufficient details regarding successful and failed login attempts to support troubleshooting and incident response activities. It is helpful for these logs to track which users log in, what type of browser they are logging in from, their IP address, what capabilities of the SSL VPN service they use, and why they may be denied from logging in (e.g., fail endpoint security because of outdated antivirus software). SSL VPN logging should adhere to the organization’s policies on log management, such as requiring copies of all log entries to be sent through a secure mechanism to centralized log servers and preserving all log entries for a certain number of days. Additional guidance on log management can be found in NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management.

### Redundancy
Organizations should carefully consider the need for a robust SSL VPN solution that can survive the failure of one or more components, even if high availability or load balancing is already part of the VPN design. If the SSL VPN solution is supporting critical functions within the organization, redundancy should also be considered for supporting systems such as authentication servers and directory servers.

### End-to-end SSL VPNs
If the corporate policy requires network connections to be protected from...# SSL VPN Implementation Guide

## 4.3.7 Summary of Design Decisions
Table 4-3 provides a checklist that summarizes the major design decisions made during the first two phases of the SSL VPN planning and implementation process.

## 4.4 Implement and Test Prototype
After the SSL VPN solution has been designed, the next step is to implement and test a prototype of the design. This could be done in one or more environments, including a laboratory network, a test network, and a production network. Ideally, implementation and testing should first be performed with a laboratory network, then a test network. Only implementations in final testing should be placed onto a production network. Aspects of the solution to evaluate include the following:

### Connectivity
- Users should be able to establish and maintain SSL VPN connections to access all resources that are intended to be accessible by the SSL VPN.
- It is important to verify that all of the intended applications are accessible by the operating systems and browsers that are most likely to be used by end users.
- Intermediate devices in the network such as routers and firewalls should not block SSL VPN connectivity, especially if the VPN device supports multiple interfaces or if multiple sites offer SSL VPN access.

### Authentication
- Users and groups should be able to authenticate and be granted access to resources.
- If various groups or access to different resources require different authentication methods, then this should be verified too.

### Access Control
- Resources should be protected in accordance with the access control policy that was established.
- This should be verified by monitoring network traffic and checking SSL VPN device logs.
- If packet filtering or multiple routing tables are used as a means of enforcing access control, then this needs to be verified as well.

### Application and Client Interoperability
- The solution should not break or interfere with the use of existing software applications.
- This is especially relevant for applications that are translated to be accessible by SSL VPN, or for complex websites that are processed by the SSL VPN reverse proxy.
- It also applies to SSL VPN client software issues (e.g., conflict between active content components and other parts of the client operating system).

### Management
- Administrators should be able to configure and manage the solution effectively and securely.
- This includes all components such as devices, management servers, and client software.
- Administrators should verify that they can create backups and restore from them.

### Network Management
- If the organization has built a network management infrastructure, this infrastructure should periodically monitor uptime and possibly performance of the SSL VPN devices.
- Either the devices should send Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps to indicate a...# SSL VPN Implementation Considerations

## 1. Monitoring and Alerts
- The network management system should determine warnings or critical issues through its polling process.

## 2. Logging
- The logging and data management functions should operate in accordance with the organization’s policies and strategies.

## 3. Performance
- The SSL VPN implementation should provide adequate performance during both normal and peak usage.
- Consideration should be given to the performance of primary SSL VPN components as well as intermediate devices such as routers and firewalls.
- Encrypted traffic often consumes more processing power than unencrypted traffic, potentially causing bottlenecks.
- The additional resources required by SSL can vary widely based on several factors, including the encryption algorithm.
- Performance is also affected by the time it takes to establish an SSL VPN session, which can be influenced by the demands of the back-end authentication system (e.g., RADIUS, LDAP, AD) and the size of the keys in the server’s certificate.
- Traffic encapsulated within an SSL connection may require intermediate network devices to fragment packets, possibly slowing network activity.
- A typical solution for these issues is to reduce the size of the maximum transmission unit (MTU) value on the host originating the network traffic.
- The MTU is the maximum allowable packet size and can often be lowered by the network administrator to prevent fragmentation of SSL-encapsulated packets.
- Testing the performance under load of a prototype implementation can be effectively done using simulated traffic generators on a live test network to closely mimic expected traffic characteristics.
- Testing should include a variety of applications that will be used with the SSL VPN implementation, especially those likely to be affected by network throughput or latency issues.
- Addressing performance problems may involve upgrading or replacing hardware, using an SSL accelerator to offload SSL processing, or reducing processing demands (e.g., limiting the number of simultaneous users or the amount of encrypted application traffic).

## 4. Portal Design and Layout
- The portal provided for SSL VPN access should be intuitive and straightforward to navigate.
- It should contain the features required by users and only display resources for which the current user is authorized.
- If relevant, the portal should be consistent with the organization’s guidelines for websites and applications.

## 5. Security of the Implementation
- Parts of the SSL VPN’s implementation, such as the SSL code or the firewall code, may contain vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.
- Organizations with high security requirements may want to perform extensive vulnerability assessments against the SSL VPN components.
- At a minimum, testers should update the SSL VPN components with the latest patches and configure the components following sound security practices.# SSL VPN Security Features

## 1. Security Features
To protect against cross-site scripting, Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, and buffer overflow attacks, the following features should be enabled:

### 1.1 Endpoint Security
- Only client machines that pass the security requirements (e.g., firewall, antivirus software) should be granted access to the SSL VPN.
- If any security mechanism such as a virtual storage space or cache cleaner is enabled during a login session, these mechanisms should erase all data downloaded during the VPN session.

### 1.2 Default Settings
- SSL VPN implementations have many default configuration settings.
- Implementers should carefully review the default values for each setting and alter them as necessary to support their design goals.
- Ensure that the implementation does not unexpectedly revert to default settings for interoperability or other reasons.

## 2. Application and Client Interoperability
Application and client interoperability is a key requirement for a successful SSL VPN implementation. This is especially important due to the diversity of both accessible applications and potential user client environments. It is difficult to predict how a specific client will interoperate with a specific application through the SSL VPN.

### 2.1 Potential Interoperability Issues
Some examples of potential interoperability issues include:

- **Complex Web Applications**: Applications that use JavaScript, Flash, or other languages may not function correctly after being translated by the SSL VPN proxy component. For example, these applications may include URLs to internal sites that cannot be traversed because they are not visible to the proxy. Even if the proxy can translate some of the programming code, it might not be able to translate all of it.

- **URL Alteration**: Some SSL VPN devices alter the URL when they function as a proxy. In this case, the user enters a URL for a website to access, but this URL is altered so it no longer resembles what was originally entered. This alteration may prevent some applications from working correctly.

- **Active Content Controls**: Clients may not be able to download and install the active content controls required to establish the SSL VPN network extension. This may be due to popup blocker settings in the user’s browser, managed desktop settings that prevent the installation of active content controls for security reasons, or idiosyncrasies on the client machine.

- **Endpoint Security Mechanisms**: These may not work correctly on a client machine, either preventing login or failing to erase sensitive data from the machine after the session is over. These issues may arise from idiosyncrasies on the client machine, conflicts with other security programs such as personal firewalls, or conflicts between multiple endpoint security programs running simultaneously.

### 2.2 Testing for Interoperability
The best way to determine if there are interoperability issues is to test as many configurations as possible in a lab or test environment. The most popular configurations of all target operating system platforms (e.g., Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) should be tested with the most popular web browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari). The testing process should also attempt to verify that the organization’s applications are accessible in each commonly used browser and operating system.# Interoperability Testing and Deployment of SSL VPN Solutions

## Introduction
It is impossible to test every single permutation of client environment because of the wide variety of possible configuration settings on each machine. However, at least a default configuration of each commonly used operating system and browser should be tested.

## Interoperability Testing Process
### Disk Imaging Technologies
Disk imaging technologies could be helpful in the interoperability testing process. Baseline images of each operating system could be created and then restored to the baseline after each iteration of testing. This practice helps to ensure consistency during the testing process and may help to identify specific configurations that result in interoperability problems.

### Virtual Machine Technology
Virtual machine technology could also be helpful in a similar way, where a “snapshot” of the baseline operating system running in a virtual machine is created and then restored after each testing iteration. Virtual machine technology streamlines the interoperability testing process by vastly reducing the time to restore a machine to its initial baseline condition.

### Troubleshooting Interoperability Problems
If interoperability problems are discovered, the organization should work with the SSL VPN device vendor to troubleshoot them. Helping the vendor to replicate these problems is essential for this process. The problems may be solved by configuration changes, patches provided by the vendor, or modifications to the application or operating system that is causing the problem. If an interoperability problem with an application cannot be solved, the organization may have to reconsider whether it will be possible to enable remote access for the application.

## Deploy the Solution
Once testing is complete and any issues have been resolved, the next phase of the SSL VPN planning and implementation model involves deploying the solution.

### Pilot Program
It is important to launch a pilot program before enterprise-wide deployment. A pilot program should consist of users who will be helpful for testing the SSL VPN solution for interoperability, functionality, and usability. Pilot users should fall in a broad range of technical knowledge levels to evaluate the organization’s ability to answer a wide variety of technical questions regarding the SSL VPN solution.

The limited nature of a pilot program helps to identify a set of problems that could potentially affect a greater audience, while offering the opportunity to fix these problems before the SSL VPN is used by the entire enterprise.

### User Training and Support
Part of the pilot program includes end user training and help desk support to assist users in understanding and using the SSL VPN’s features. End users can either be trained in hands-on sessions or larger lectures. Users also require documentation that serves as a reference in supplementing the training. Help desk personnel should receive more detailed technical training so they can help users troubleshoot problems and walk them through the process of establishing VPN connectivity.

If the pilot program is small enough, the group deploying the SSL VPN solution may provide technical support to pilot users, with training for help desk personnel occurring later.

### Gradual Migration
After the pilot program has been launched, it is recommended that the organization gradually migrate to the full deployment of the SSL VPN solution.# SSL VPN Deployment and Management

## Phased Deployment

The phased deployment of the SSL VPN solution allows administrators to evaluate the impact and resolve issues before enterprise-wide deployment. Most issues encountered during SSL VPN deployment are similar to those in any large IT deployment.

### Technical Documentation

During the deployment phase, the organization should produce technical documentation that includes:

- Instructions on configuring the SSL VPN devices to their present state
- Access control policy
- Routing and firewall configuration policies
- Standard operating procedures for the SSL VPN implementation
- Endpoint security requirements

### Typical Issues During Deployment

Several issues may arise at various stages of the deployment process:

- **Encrypted Traffic**: Can negatively affect services such as firewalls, intrusion detection, Quality of Service (QoS), remote monitoring (RMON) probes, and congestion control protocols.
- **Performance Issues**: Unexpected performance issues may arise with the SSL VPN components or intermediate devices such as routers.
- **Traffic Flow Problems**: SSL VPN traffic may not flow properly on some production networks due to firewalls, routers, or other intermediate packet filtering devices that block SSL VPN traffic.
- **Environmental Changes**: Changes in the environment during deployment, such as client operating system updates or new application installations, can break active content controls used for network extensions. This is easier to manage in a controlled environment but can pose significant problems if users have full control over their systems.

## Manage the Solution

The final phase of the SSL VPN planning and implementation model is the longest. Managing the solution involves maintaining the SSL VPN architecture, policies, software, and other components of the deployed solution.

### Maintenance Actions

Typical maintenance actions include:

- Testing and applying patches or software updates to the SSL VPN devices
- Deploying SSL VPN connectivity to additional remote sites
- Renewing SSL server certificates that are about to expire
- Adapting policies as requirements change

### Performance Monitoring

It is crucial to monitor the performance of SSL VPN components to identify and address potential resource issues before performance degrades significantly. Periodic testing should also be performed to verify that access controls are functioning as expected.

### Lifecycle Management

Any new hardware, software, or significant configuration changes will restart the process at the Identify Requirements phase, ensuring that the SSL VPN solution lifecycle operates effectively and efficiently.

### Handling Operational Issues

Managing the SSL VPN solution also involves addressing operational issues. For instance, poor performance may result from connection problems such as fragmentation, which occurs when network packets are broken down into smaller fragments that need to be reassembled at the destination.# Troubleshooting SSL VPN Connections

A network sniffer such as tcpdump or Wireshark is typically very helpful in troubleshooting SSL VPN connections. A sniffer allows the administrator to analyze the communications as they take place and correct problems. Because SSL traffic is encrypted and may not be decipherable from a standard packet capture, some SSL VPN devices provide decrypted network sniffing capability so that connectivity from one of the VPN endpoints may be analyzed. SSL VPN device logs and client logs may also be valuable resources during troubleshooting. Additionally, firewall and router logs may validate whether the SSL VPN traffic is reaching them, passing through them, or being blocked.

## 4.7 Summary

This section describes a phased approach to SSL VPN planning and implementation and highlights various issues that may be of significance to implementers. The following summarizes the key points from the section:

- The use of a phased approach for SSL VPN planning and implementation can help to achieve successful SSL VPN deployments. The five phases of the approach are as follows:
1. **Identify Requirements**: Identify the requirements for remote access and determine how they can best be met.
2. **Design the Solution**: Make design decisions in five areas: access control, endpoint security, authentication methods, architecture, and cryptography policy.
3. **Implement and Test a Prototype**: Test a prototype of the designed solution in a lab, test, or production environment to identify any potential issues.
4. **Deploy the Solution**: Gradually deploy the SSL VPN solution throughout the enterprise, beginning with a pilot program.
5. **Manage the Solution**: Maintain the SSL VPN components and resolve operational issues. Repeat the planning and implementation process when significant changes need to be incorporated into the solution.

- The organization should base its access control policy on its organizational requirements for remote access. These requirements stipulate which resources should be accessed by which groups or individuals. The access control policy could provide additional requirements and make access to resources dependent on other characteristics such as the authentication method used, computer type and location, and user identification.

- The endpoint security policy specifies the host integrity checks that are performed before a host logs in. The policy also defines the checks that are performed after logout to guarantee the security of data that is downloaded during the VPN session.

- The organization should select an authentication solution that is consistent with its security policy. The method of authentication can vary by user, group, or specific resource.

- There are three main types of hardware configuration: a hardware appliance, an option to an existing security product, and a software solution. The hardware appliance configuration is the most common.

- The placement of an SSL VPN device has potential security, functionality, and performance implications.# SSL VPN Implementation Considerations

## Routing Policy
- Routing policy is an important consideration, especially if the VPN implementation supports network extension, split tunneling, or multiple sites.
- It is recommended that NAT not be used so traffic to and from individual remote hosts can be tracked.

## Load Balancing and High Availability
- SSL VPN devices vary widely in how they support load balancing and high availability, so the organization should select a device that supports its load balancing or high availability requirements.

## Clientless Access
- Although SSL VPNs are described as clientless, some forms of SSL VPN access such as network extension require dynamically downloaded agents to be run on the host.

## User Access
- SSL VPN users require access to a portal so they can login to the SSL VPN and gain access to internal resources.
- The portal can either be supplied by the SSL VPN device vendor or developed by the organization itself.
- The organization’s access control policy determines the VPN options available to a user.

## Cryptographic Standards
- The strongest possible cryptographic algorithms and key lengths that are considered secure for current practice should be used for encryption and integrity protection unless they are incompatible with performance and export constraints.
- For government agencies, traffic that requires protection must employ FIPS-compliant cryptographic algorithms.

## Design Decisions
- Other design decisions include IPv6 capability, incident response, log management, and redundancy.

## Testing
- Testing of the prototype implementation should evaluate multiple factors including connectivity, authentication, access control, endpoint security, application and client interoperability, management, network management, logging, performance, portal design and layout, and security.

## Pilot Program
- It is important to launch a pilot program before enterprise-wide deployment.
- Once this program has been launched, it is recommended to gradually migrate existing network infrastructure, applications, and users to the new SSL VPN solution.

## Maintenance
- After implementation, the SSL VPN solution needs to be maintained.
- Such maintenance can include applying patches and deploying SSL VPN connectivity to additional remote sites.
- Operational issues also need to be addressed and resolved.

## Organizational Controls
- Organizations should implement technical, operational, and management controls that support and complement SSL VPN implementations.
- Examples include having control over all entry and exit points for the protected networks, ensuring the security of all SSL VPN endpoints, and incorporating SSL VPN considerations into organizational policies.

# SSL VPN Recommended Practices
This section summarizes the information presented in the previous sections as a manageable and actionable set of recommendations that organizations can implement to provide reasonable assurance that their SSL VPN solutions are providing adequate security and are themselves secured properly.

To be effective, an SSL VPN should have its security considerations incorporated throughout the entire IT life cycle, involving everything from policy to operations. This section references a five-phase life cycle model to help organizations determine at what point in their SSL VPN deployments a recommended practice should be applied.# SSL VPN Security Practices

## Introduction
The model is based on one introduced in NIST SP 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle. Organizations may follow a project management methodology or life cycle model that does not directly map to the phases in the model presented in this section, but the types of tasks in the methodology and their sequencing are probably similar.

## Recommended Practices
Table 5-1 presents the recommended practices corresponding to the life cycle phases. Each recommendation is accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for its inclusion and section reference for more information, and is rated as "recommended practice" or "should consider." Organizations are strongly encouraged to adopt the recommended practices. Failure to implement them significantly increases the risk of an SSL VPN security failure or makes it more difficult to assess the overall security of the SSL VPN system.

Organizations should also examine each of the "should consider" recommendations to determine their applicability to the target environment. In general, "should consider" measures enhance security beyond what can be achieved through the recommended practices. A "should consider" should be rejected only if it is infeasible or if the reduction in risk from its implementation does not justify its cost.

## Alternatives to SSL VPNs
Although SSL VPNs are flexible enough to meet many needs, there are certain cases when other types of VPNs may provide a better solution. This section lists several VPN protocols that are used as alternatives to SSL VPNs in different scenarios.

### VPN Protocols by TCP/IP Model Layer
This section groups the types of VPN by the approximate layer of the TCP/IP model at which they function, because many of the protocols’ characteristics are based on the layer they use. SSL is the prevalent transport layer VPN protocol; this section discusses several data link layer, network layer, and application layer VPN protocols. For each protocol, a brief description is provided, along with a description of the circumstances under which it may be more advantageous than an SSL VPN.

### 6.1 Data Link Layer VPN Protocols
Data link layer VPN protocols function below the network layer in the TCP/IP model. This means that various network protocols, such as IP, Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), and Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) Extended User Interface (NetBEUI), can usually be used with a data link layer VPN.

Most VPN protocols, such as IPsec, only support IP, so data link layer VPN protocols may provide a viable option for protecting networks running non-IP protocols and for networks running more than one network protocol (such as IP and IPX at the same time).

The most commonly implemented data link layer VPN protocols are typically used on top of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and are most often used to secure modem-based connections. PPP, not the VPN protocol itself, typically provides encryption and authentication services for the traffic. The standards for PPP only reference supporting Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) for authentication.# Data Link Layer VPN Protocols

## Introduction
Data link layer VPN protocols often utilize additional protocols and services to enhance encryption and authentication for VPN connections due to known weaknesses in certain algorithms. The most commonly used data link layer VPN protocols include:

## Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) Version 2
- **Overview**: PPTP provides a protected tunnel between a PPTP-enabled client (e.g., a personal computer) and a PPTP-enabled server. Each system using PPTP must have the appropriate client software installed and configured.
- **Transport Mechanism**: PPTP uses Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) to transport data. Most packet filtering devices block this protocol by default, necessitating reconfiguration to permit it for systems using PPTP for a VPN. In addition to the GRE connection, PPTP establishes a separate control channel using TCP port 1723.
- **Encryption**: Microsoft has developed its own PPP encryption mechanism for PPTP, known as Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE), which uses a 40-bit or 128-bit key with the RSA RC4 algorithm. Microsoft also created MS-CHAP to provide stronger authentication than PAP and CHAP; however, researchers have identified serious weaknesses in MS-CHAP.
- **Security Flaws**: The original version of PPTP had significant security flaws. PPTP version 2 addressed many of these issues, but weaknesses have been identified in it as well, in addition to the MS-CHAP vulnerabilities.

## Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
- **Overview**: Similar to PPTP, L2TP protects communications between an L2TP-enabled client and an L2TP-enabled server, requiring L2TP client software to be installed and configured on each user system.
- **Transport Mechanism**: Unlike PPTP, which relies on GRE, L2TP uses its own tunneling protocol that operates over UDP port 1701, making it potentially easier to pass through packet filtering devices.
- **Session Support**: L2TP can support multiple sessions within the same tunnel.
- **Standardization**: L2TP with IPsec is an established standard of the IETF (RFC 3193).
- **Authentication Methods**: In addition to PPP-provided authentication methods, L2TP can utilize other methods such as RADIUS and Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS+).
- **Encryption**: L2TP often employs IPsec to provide encryption and key management services.

## Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F)
- **Overview**: Unlike PPTP and L2TP, L2F is designed for use between network devices, such as an ISP’s network access server and an organization’s VPN gateway. Users establish unprotected connections from their computers to the ISP. The ISP recognizes that the users’ traffic should be tunneled to the organization, authenticating each user and the organization’s VPN gateway, and then providing protection for the traffic between the ISP and the organization.
- **Client Requirements**: The use of L2F requires the ISP’s support and participation. Since L2F is not client-based, users’ systems do not need L2F client software or configuration. However, this also means that communications between the users and the ISP are unprotected until they reach the organization’s VPN gateway.# VPN Protocols Overview

## 6.1 L2TP and L2F

- L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) was intended to replace PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) and L2F (Layer 2 Forwarding).
- L2F can use authentication protocols such as RADIUS and TACACS+, but it does not support encryption.
- When configured properly, L2TP combined with IPsec can provide strong encryption and authentication.
- PPTP should not be used to protect communications due to its known weaknesses.
- L2F provides limited protection for communications involving a participating ISP, making L2TP the preferred choice when protecting the link from the remote user to the ISP.
- L2TP with IPsec is a viable option for ensuring confidentiality and integrity for dial-up communications, especially for organizations contracting VPN services to an ISP.

## 6.2 Network Layer VPN Protocols

- Network layer VPN protocols apply to all applications and are not application-specific, allowing protection of network communications without modifying applications.
- IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is the most common network layer security control used to create VPNs.
- IPsec is a framework of open standards for ensuring private communications over public networks.
- The primary components of IPsec include:
- Authentication Header (AH)
- Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
- Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
- IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp)
- Network layer controls like IPsec often provide a better solution than transport or application layer controls due to the challenges of adding controls to individual applications.
- An advantage of network layer controls is that they protect both the data within packets and the IP information for each packet.
- However, network layer controls offer less control and flexibility for protecting specific applications compared to transport and application layer controls.

## 6.3 Application Layer “VPNs”

- Application layer protocols provide protection for only a single application, often protecting only a portion of the application data.
- For example, S/MIME and OpenPGP can encrypt the body of an email but not the email headers, which include addressing information.
- Encrypting at the mail server creates a secure path between mail servers, but only for the data covered by the cryptographic changes.
- Such encryption is difficult to classify as a VPN; it is not a network but rather a set of paths.
- Even if the entire message is encrypted (e.g., Voice over IP using encryption), it remains a collection of encrypted data rather than a network.
- Therefore, it is incorrect to label anything above the network layer as a “VPN,” despite many companies marketing their application-layer encryption products as such.
- A commonly used application layer protocol suite is Secure Shell (SSH).# SSH Tunnels and VPNs

## Overview of SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) provides secure replacements for several unencrypted application protocols, including Telnet, Remote Copy Protocol (RCP), and FTP. The SSH client program itself offers protection for remote logins to another system.

## SSH Tunnels
Some organizations extend the use of the SSH application by establishing SSH tunnels between hosts, allowing other communications to pass through these tunnels. This method enables multiple applications to be protected simultaneously through a single tunnel. Generally, the tunnel is constructed between a remote user’s system and a server within the organization that the user can log into.

### Characteristics of SSH Tunnels
- A single SSH tunnel can provide protection for one or more applications at the same time, making it technically a transport layer VPN protocol rather than an application layer protocol.
- Setting up SSH tunnel-based VPNs is resource-intensive. It requires:
- Installation and configuration of SSH client software on each user’s machine.
- Reconfiguration of client applications to utilize the tunnel.
- Each user must have login privileges on a server within the organization.

### User Requirements
Users typically need solid technical skills to configure systems and applications themselves and troubleshoot any issues that arise. Due to these requirements, using SSH tunnels as a VPN is uncommon, especially when compared to SSL VPN deployment.

## Summary of Alternatives to SSL VPNs
Section 6 describes the main alternatives to SSL VPNs. These include:

- **Data Link Layer VPN Protocols**: Such as PPTP, L2TP, and L2F.
- **Network Layer VPN Protocols**: Primarily IPsec.
- **Application Layer “VPN” Protocols**: Including OpenPGP and SSH.

### Key Points from Section 6
- **Data Link Layer VPNs**:
- Protect various network protocols and are often used for non-IP protocols.
- Commonly used on top of PPP to secure modem-based connections, although PPP itself encrypts the traffic.
- **PPTP**: Protects communications between a PPTP-enabled client and server, using GRE to transport data.
- **L2TP**: Protects communications between an L2TP-enabled client and server, using its own tunneling protocol over UDP port 1701.
- **L2F**: Protects communications between two network devices, such as ISP network access servers and VPN gateways. It is transparent to users but does not protect communications between users’ systems and ISPs.

- **Network Layer VPNs**:
- Provide secure communication between two hosts or networks without modifying any applications.
- IPsec is the most common network layer VPN, securing some or all communications between two endpoints. It protects both the data in the packet and the IP information, such as IP addresses. However, IPsec VPNs only support IP and offer less flexibility and control for protecting specific applications.

- **Application Layer “VPNs”**:
- These protocols allow encryption to be added to applications.# SSL VPNs and Network Security

These are not really VPNs because there is no network involved.

## Table of Port Numbers

Table 6-2 lists the TCP and UDP port numbers and IP protocols associated with SSL VPNs and the alternative VPN protocols described in Section 6. This information may be helpful in configuring other network security devices, such as firewalls and routers, to permit VPN activity to pass through.

# Case Study

This section presents an SSL VPN solution planning and implementation case study. The case study begins by describing a real-world security requirement scenario: protecting network communications between remote users and a main office. The case study then discusses possible solutions for the security requirement and explains why an SSL VPN architecture was selected over the alternatives.

## Design and Implementation

The next section of the case study discusses the design of the solution and also provides some details of the implementation of the solution prototype, including examples of configuring the solution using commonly available equipment and software.

> **Note:** The case study is not meant to endorse the use of particular products, nor are any products being recommended over other products. A fictional combination of several common products was chosen so that the case study would demonstrate a variety of solutions. Organizations and individuals should not replicate and deploy the sample entries. They are intended to illustrate the decisions and actions involved in configuring the solutions, not to be deployed as-is into systems.

## Scenario Description

The scenario described here is connecting remote users to a single main office. A medium-sized organization has a large population of users that work from remote locations once to several days each week. The organization is research-oriented, and many of these users require access to a broad range of internal IT resources to conduct their research. These resources include email, calendar, file sharing services, and secure shell access on a variety of hosts.

The organization already offers remote access services in the form of a host-to-gateway IPsec solution. This works successfully but has required significant IT labor resources to install and support the client software on user hosts. The current solution also does not provide remote access for hosts based in public locations such as hotels and kiosks. The organization is therefore looking to implement a complementary remote access architecture.

## 7.1 Identifying Needs and Evaluating Options

The organization specifies its organizational requirements for remote access:

- All users should have access to all internal network resources, especially email and calendar services. This open policy is necessary because of the broad range of IT resources required by users to conduct their research. Users may also be required to authenticate themselves to specific resources such as file shares and databases.

- Users should only have access to a limited set of internal services such as email and calendaring if they are using public hosts (e.g., hosts located in environments such as hotels and Internet cafes).

- A small population of users outside of the organization, human resources (HR) staff from the parent organization, should have access to a limited set of internal HR applications.# Remote Access Solutions

After articulating these requirements, the organization considers its options for remote access:

## Network Layer Solution: IPsec VPN
As mentioned earlier, the organization has already established IPsec-based network layer VPN services for remote users. Many users are satisfied with this solution, but it can be cumbersome for IT staff to support because each host requires client software to be installed and supported. Moreover, hosts without the preinstalled client software cannot access internal resources.

## Transport Layer Solution: SSL VPN
The organization could provide an SSL VPN between the remote users and the office over the Internet. Network extension is the most flexible option because it provides broad access for users into an internal network.

## Application Layer Solution: Application Modification
The organization could modify every application required for remote access. Applications such as SSH are already supported for remote access. Due to the broad range of relevant applications, it is not considered feasible to modify all of them.

The organization decides to develop an SSL VPN solution. This solution will complement and not replace the existing IPsec VPN services. It is assumed that some users will stay with the IPsec solution, but others will migrate to SSL VPN over time. The organization purchases a commercial appliance with a support contract to ensure the existence of vendor support.

# 7.2 Designing the Solution
The organization goes through the process described in Section 4.3 to design the SSL VPN solution. It first designs an access control policy to determine who can access internal resources and under what conditions. The next step is to create an endpoint security policy that enforces access control, usually with host integrity checks. Creating an authentication infrastructure follows, and designing the architecture and deciding on encryption are the last steps.

## 7.2.1 Access Control Policy
The organization goes through the four major steps to designing an access control policy that are described in Section 4.3.1:

1. **List the resources that will be accessed through the SSL VPN.** Users should have access to all internal network resources, so these resources can all be grouped together. If a specific resource such as a file share or database requires additional authentication, then this takes place when a user accesses the resource. The only exception to this policy of grouping all resources is a set of HR applications that only a small set of external users is authorized to access. Note that these users may not access the other internal resources that other users can access.

2. **List the groups or users.** Most users are in one main group that has network connectivity to all internal resources. A smaller group is composed of external users that have access to the set of HR applications mentioned in the previous step.

3. **List the conditions under which the resources should be accessible by the groups.** There are several conditions for accessing resources:
- Users must use hosts managed by the organization to gain access to internal resources.# Access Control and Endpoint Security Policy

## Access Control Policy

The organization has established an access control policy that includes the following guidelines:

- **Organization-Managed Hosts**:
- All organization-managed hosts have a system registry key installed that can be checked to verify their identity.

- **Public Location Access**:
- Users who log in from systems in a public location, such as a kiosk or Internet café, or use their personal computers can only access a limited set of web-based applications, such as email, calendaring, and the employee phone directory.

- **External Users**:
- A small group of external users that access the HR applications must also use organization-managed hosts to gain access to these applications.

- **Host Requirements**:
- All hosts, public or otherwise, must be running the latest version of Windows with critical security updates installed and an antivirus package with an up-to-date virus signature database.
- They must also have a firewall program installed and running. Any host not meeting these requirements is not permitted to log in.

### VPN Access to Resources

Resources are accessible in different ways:

- **Internal Resources**:
- The organization’s internal resources are accessible by network extension because a broad number of them are hosted on multiple servers. Some web-based applications do not function properly when proxying is used, so network extension must be used.

- **Public Hosts Access**:
- When users log in from public hosts that are not organization-managed, they can access a set of web-based applications via proxy.

- **HR Applications**:
- The set of HR applications are accessible by network extension because some require many interlocking programs and cannot be accessed by other means.

### Summary Table

Table 7-1 summarizes the organization’s access control policy.

## Endpoint Security Policy

The organization designs an endpoint security policy to enforce access control. The policy is mainly driven by a pre-login sequence executed by the SSL VPN appliance before a user logs in. This sequence runs host integrity checks that require the host to download and run active content controls. These controls or applets ensure that the host complies with the organization’s endpoint security policy.

### Key Elements of the Endpoint Security Policy

- **Organization-Managed Hosts**:
- An organization-managed host is identified by a registry key indicating that the host is managed by the organization. The host integrity check only needs to find this key to verify the host’s identity.
- Organization-managed hosts use network extension to gain full access to the internal network. A packet filter is configured on the SSL VPN to prevent these hosts from accessing the restricted set of HR applications.
- If a user is permitted to use the restricted set of HR applications, a packet filter is configured on the SSL VPN to prevent the user from accessing any resource outside the HR applications.
- Users are permitted to keep all cookies, web browser cache entries, and downloaded files and attachments.

- **Non-Organization Managed Hosts**:
- A host that is not organization-managed or is personally owned can only access web applications via proxy.
- The SSL VPN session is established in a virtual storage space, and all data stored or downloaded during the session is erased after logout.# Security and Authentication Guidelines

## 7.2 Host Requirements
All hosts must run one or more specific versions of Windows, with each specific version using the most current set of updates. Critical security updates are also required to be installed. The host must run an antivirus software program certified by the organization that is active and uses a virus signature database that has been updated in the past month. The host must also run a firewall program.

## 7.2.3 Authentication Scheme
The organization has an existing RADIUS authentication infrastructure for multiple resources such as databases and email servers. The SSL VPN appliances use the same RADIUS servers to authenticate users as they log in to the SSL VPN portal. The groups that are defined by the access control policy are configured in RADIUS. Most users belong to one large RADIUS group, while external users granted access to the HR applications are placed into another smaller RADIUS group. The SSL VPN appliances determine this group information from RADIUS to dynamically map users into the correct group. For example, a user who is a member of the HR Users’ RADIUS group is only given access to the HR applications.

Users authenticate themselves via two-factor authentication. Each user must type in a password and use a physical token to enter a one-time password generated by the token.

### Table 7-2: Authentication Method for Each Internal Resource

For server authentication, the organization purchases an SSL server certificate from a CA whose root certificate is already installed in most common browsers and installs the SSL server certificate on the SSL VPN appliance.

## 7.2.4 Architecture Design
The organization designs an architecture incorporating the SSL VPN appliances within its existing network infrastructure. It performs configuration of the appliances and devises a management policy.

## 7.2.5 Selection of Hardware Configuration
The organization chooses an appliance solution developed by a commercial vendor. Hardware appliances are the most common type of SSL VPN hardware on the market today, and they possess the advantages of being preconfigured and already hardened by the vendor. Furthermore, support is more straightforward because the device configuration is standardized.

## 7.2.6 Device Placement and Firewall Configuration
The organization adopts an internal SSL VPN approach for device placement. Access to TCP port 443 on the SSL VPN for all external addresses is added to the corporate firewall; no other access rules are added to the firewall. This is similar to the architecture shown in Figure 4-2.

## 7.2.7 Routing Policy
The organization prohibits split tunneling, so the remote access host sends all traffic destined for internal subnets and the rest of the Internet through the VPN tunnel. Traffic destined for machines outside the organization’s perimeter is blocked by the SSL VPN. In this case, attempts to go off the corporate network directly from the user's system are blocked. Some SSL VPNs include hairpin proxies that allow VPN users to leave the network, but only by traversing the SSL VPN gateway.# VPN Infrastructure Overview

## 7.2.8 High Availability
The organization is pursuing a high availability strategy. The VPN appliance supports high availability with an active/passive architecture. Configuration settings are mirrored across both devices, so any configuration change made to the active device is automatically copied to the passive device’s configuration. VPN session information is also mirrored; users do not have to reauthenticate after a device failure, but existing TCP connections are broken and do have to be reestablished.

## 7.2.9 Management
The management policy for the VPN appliances is consistent with the organization’s security policy. Administrative access is only supported on the appliance’s internal interface and is limited to a small set of IP addresses. Accounts with limited administrative access are created and assigned to different groups, such as one account that can review system logs and another account that can update the host integrity checks to search for recent security updates.

Configuration settings are backed up each week to a central server. The organization also uses a set of appliances for testing and staging. They are configured identically to the live units, and any updates or patches are applied on them first.

The appliances are monitored by the organization’s network management system. The network management system periodically pings the appliances’ IP addresses and polls the appliances’ SNMP management information base (MIB). It compares data from the MIB with known operational values to search for any potential operational issues.

## 7.2.10 Client Software Selection
The prelogin sequence requires a remote access host to download and execute active content so the host integrity checks can be performed. The desktop management policies for the organization-managed hosts are configured to permit specific active content controls to run locally.

## 7.2.11 Portal Design
The organization uses the portal provided by the VPN appliance vendor. It provides some customization such as altering the banner graphics to be consistent with the organization’s logo and colors. It also only displays options that the user is authorized to access. For example, if a user is in the group that is only allowed to view the HR Web sites, only those sites are listed on the user’s portal page.

## 7.2.12 Encryption Scheme
The organization requires FIPS 140-2 compliance for its SSL VPN solution. As a result, the organization verifies the level of FIPS compliance of the system before purchasing it. The organization configures the SSL VPN to only permit logins from client browsers that use SSL cipher suites with FIPS-approved cryptography. The appliance is also configured to require browsers to support TLS 1.0 for SSL connections.# 7.3 Implementing a Prototype

After the organization designs the SSL VPN solution, it implements and tests a prototype of the design. The prototype is initially configured and tested in a laboratory network and is moved later to a production network so access to actual internal resources can be tested. The laboratory network replicates the addresses of the corporate network, and thus needs to be completely unconnected to the corporate network. The test network includes a firewall with the same configuration as the corporate firewall, and example servers that have the same capabilities and the same addresses as the servers that will be accessed through the SSL VPN.

The organization develops a test plan to evaluate functionality and connectivity. The plan is based on Section 4.3 and includes tests for connectivity, authentication, access control, endpoint security, and client interoperability. Users of multiple operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, Macintosh), device types (e.g., laptops, PDAs, smart phones), and Web browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Mozilla, Safari) must be able to access internal resources from outside the network. If users are using organization-managed hosts, then they should be able to do everything they could do if they were located in their offices. Multiple scenarios such as a user logging in from a public host or a host that has an out of date virus database must be tested. The testers also validate that people with different types of RADIUS credentials only get the expected type of access when they log in during the test.

## 7.3.1 Example Configuration Steps

Different SSL VPNs have different administrative interfaces. Many allow control through Web browsers, while some use custom programs, and still others use old-style command line interfaces (CLI). In this section, a fictitious SSL VPN that has a browser interface is described along with examples of steps that might be taken to implement the rules from the scenario.

The interface has four major sections:
- **System**
- **Users**
- **Access**
- **Policies**

To begin, the administrator needs to configure the addresses of the Ethernet interface on the SSL VPN. The administrator goes to the Ethernet choice in the System menu and sets the address assigned to the SSL VPN on the inside of the corporate network. Because this system is configured inside the existing network, no routing needs to be defined; had this SSL VPN been located outside the firewall or on the DMZ, the administrator would need to specify routing information.

Using the Add User Group choice of the Users menu, the administrator creates a group called “NormalUsers”. In this dialog box, the administrator specifies which authentication mechanisms are used (a password and a physical token) and specifies how the authentication is validated (using the existing RADIUS server). The administrator specifies that participation in the NormalUsers group for the VPN is given to people whom the RADIUS server labels as “User”. They use the Add User Group choice to add a second group, “HROnlyUsers”, but participation in that group is the people the...# RADIUS Server Configuration

## Access Menu Configuration

The Access menu allows the administrator to define resources accessible to members of each user group.

### Creating Access Groups

1. **NormalFullAccess**:
- Links “NormalUsers” to all network services using a network extension program from the SSL VPN.
- The network extension’s packet filter is set to block TCP ports 80 and 443 of the addresses of the Web servers controlled by the HR department.
- Only display available resources for this access group is selected.

2. **NormalPartialAccess**:
- Created for users accessing the SSL VPN from equipment not owned by the organization.
- Links “NormalUsers” only to TCP port 80 of the addresses for three Web servers (corporate calendar, Web mail system, employee phone directory) using a reverse Web proxy.
- Only display available resources is selected.

3. **HRAccess**:
- Links “HROnlyUsers” using a network extension program from the SSL VPN.
- Allows access to only TCP ports 80 and 443 of the addresses of the Web servers controlled by the HR department.
- Only display available resources is selected.

## Policy List Configuration

The three access lists each have associated policies. The administrator uses the Policy List command in the Policies menu to create a list of policies.

### Creating Policies

1. The dialog box starts with an empty list; the administrator clicks the Add button to create the first policy.
2. The following policies are specified for everyone in the NormalFullAccess group:
- The remote host is managed by the organization.
- The latest version of one or more specific versions of Windows is being used.
- The most current set of patches and security updates has been applied to the operating system.
- An approved antivirus program is running.
- An approved firewall program with an approved configuration is running.
- Split tunneling is not permitted.
- The protocol used must be TLS 1.0 or later.
- The cryptographic protocol being used must comply with FIPS 140-2.

3. Similar policies are created for everyone in the NormalPartialAccess and HRAccess groups.

## SSL VPN Management Configuration

The last steps involve configuring the management of the SSL VPN itself.

### Administrator Configuration

- In the Administrators command in the System menu:
- Change the default password that came with the system.
- Set the range of IP addresses that can be used to administer the system.
- Create additional administrative accounts with limited rights, such as for viewing particular logs.

### Backup Configuration

- Under the Backup command in the System menu:
- Set up automatic weekly backups to be sent to an FTP server on the internal network.

### SNMP and Replication Configuration

- The SNMP command in the System menu is used to allow monitoring of the device.
- The Replication command in the System menu allows configuration of the high availability feature:
- The administrator enters the address of the other server.# The High Availability Group

## 7.4 Deploying and Managing the Solution

The organization employs a pilot program to deploy the solution. It solicits volunteers who can contribute their user experience and help to troubleshoot any problems with connectivity or interoperability. The SSL VPN development staff also produces documentation to help in establishing VPN connectivity. The documentation assists users in enabling the host integrity checks to be executed on their hosts, and it addresses frequently asked questions.

## 7.5 Summary

Section 7 covered a case study for planning and implementing an SSL VPN system for an organization. The steps described in this section follow the recommendations and guidelines given throughout this document for choosing and setting up an SSL VPN. It should be emphasized that the scenario described in this section is for a fictitious organization and that the steps taken by a real organization would likely be different from those given here.

The portrayed organization first identified its needs based on its current operations and its stated future goals for secure remote access. In designing the proposed solution, the organization followed the typical steps of creating both an access control and an endpoint security policy: laying out its methods for authentication of users, designing an overall architecture for the expected remote access solution, selecting the hardware needed to meet its goals, specifying where in its current network the hardware will go, determining whether or not it needs a high availability solution, creating a management policy for the system and users, selecting the client software, designing the portal that the users will see when they connect to the system, and developing an encryption policy.

After this design was completed, the organization implemented a prototype of the system before deploying it fully. The test plan for this prototype involved creating a sample configuration for the network access, the list of users for the system, definitions of the types of access that will be given to the users, and a specific policy plan linking the users to the types of access as well as other policy restrictions on the users.
