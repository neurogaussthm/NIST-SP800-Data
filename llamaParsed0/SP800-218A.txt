# Abstract
This document augments the secure software development practices and tasks defined in the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) version 1.1 by adding practices, tasks, recommendations, considerations, notes, and informative references that are specific to AI model development throughout the software development life cycle. These additions are documented in the form of an SSDF Community Profile to support Executive Order (EO) 14110, Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which tasked NIST with “developing a companion resource to the [SSDF] to incorporate secure development practices for generative AI and for dual-use foundation models.” This Community Profile is intended to be useful to the producers of AI models, the producers of AI systems that use those models, and the acquirers of those AI systems. This Profile should be used in conjunction with NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-218, Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version 1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities.

# 1. Introduction
Section 4.1.a of Executive Order (EO) 14110, Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence [1], tasked NIST with “developing a companion resource to the Secure Software Development Framework to incorporate secure development practices for generative AI and for dual-use foundation models.” This document is that companion resource.

The software development and use of AI models and AI systems inherit much of the same risk as any other digital system. A unique challenge for this community is the blurring of traditional boundaries between system code and system data, as well as the use of plain human language as the means of interaction with the systems. AI models and systems, their configuration parameters (e.g., model weights), and the data they interact with (e.g., training data, user queries, etc.) can form closed loops that can be manipulated for unintended functionality.

AI model and system development is still much more of an art than an exact science, requiring developers to interact with model code, training data, and other parameters over multiple iterations. Training datasets may be acquired from unknown, untrusted sources. Model weights and other training parameters can be susceptible to malicious tampering. Some models may be complex to the point that they cannot easily be thoroughly inspected, potentially allowing for undetectable execution of arbitrary code. User queries can be crafted to produce undesirable or objectionable output and — if not sanitized properly — can be leveraged for injection-style attacks. The goal of this document is to identify the practices and tasks needed to address these novel risks.

## 1.1. Purpose# SSDF Community Profile for Generative AI and Dual-Use Foundation Model Development

The SSDF provides a common language for describing secure software development practices throughout the software development life cycle. This document augments the practices and tasks defined in SSDF version 1.1 by adding recommendations, considerations, notes, and informative references that are specific to generative AI and dual-use foundation model development.

## 1. Introduction

These additions are documented in the form of an SSDF Community Profile (“Profile”), which is a baseline of SSDF practices and tasks that have been enhanced to address a particular use case. An example of an addition is:

> “Secure code storage should include AI models, model weights, pipelines, reward models, and any other AI model elements that need their confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability protected.”

This Profile supplements what SSDF version 1.1 already includes. The Profile is intended to be used in conjunction with NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-218, Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version 1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities [6] and should not be used without SP 800-218. Readers should also utilize the implementation examples and informative references defined in SP 800-218 for additional information on how to perform each SSDF practice and task for all types of software development, as they are also generally applicable to AI model and AI system development.

## 1.1 Scope

This Profile’s scope is AI model development, which includes data sourcing for, designing, training, fine-tuning, and evaluating AI models, as well as incorporating and integrating AI models into other software. Consistent with SSDF version 1.1 and EO 14110, practices for the deployment and operation of AI systems with AI models are out of scope. Similarly, while cybersecurity practices for training data and other forms of data being used for AI model development are in scope, the rest of the data governance and management life cycle is out of scope.

Practices and tasks in this Profile do not distinguish between human-written and AI-generated source code, because it is assumed that all source code should be evaluated for vulnerabilities and other issues before use.

## 1.2 Sources of Expertise

This document leverages and integrates numerous sources of expertise, including:

- NIST research and publications on trustworthy and responsible AI, including the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) [2], Adversarial Machine Learning: A Taxonomy and Terminology of Attacks and Mitigations [3], Towards a Standard for Identifying and Managing Bias in Artificial Intelligence [4], and the Dioptra experimentation testbed for security evaluations of machine learning algorithms [5].
- NIST’s Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version 1.1 [6], which is a set of fundamental, sound, and secure software development practices. It provides a common language for secure software development.# Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Community Profile for AI Model Development

## Introduction
The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a language designed to facilitate communications among stakeholders, including software producers and software acquirers. The SSDF has also been utilized in support of EO 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, to enhance software supply chain security.

### Key Resources
- **NIST General Cybersecurity Resources**:
- The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0
- Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations
- Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations

- **Expertise in AI Security**:
- AI model developers, AI researchers, AI system developers, and secure software practitioners from industry and government have shared their expertise regarding the unique security challenges of AI models. This expertise was primarily captured through NIST’s January 2024 workshop, where suggestions for adapting secure software development practices to accommodate the unique aspects of AI model development were discussed.

## Document Structure
This document is structured as follows:
1. **Section 2**: Provides additional background on the SSDF and explains what an SSDF Community Profile is and how it can be used.
2. **Section 3**: Defines the SSDF Community Profile for AI Model Development.
3. **References**: Lists all references cited in this document.
4. **Appendix A**: Provides a glossary of selected terms used within this document.

## Using the SSDF Community Profile
AI model producers, AI system producers, AI system acquirers, and others can utilize the SSDF to enhance their communications regarding secure AI model development throughout the software development life cycle.

### Benefits of Using SSDF
- **Vulnerability Reduction**: Following SSDF practices should help AI model producers reduce the number of vulnerabilities in their AI models.
- **Impact Mitigation**: It can reduce the potential impacts of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities.
- **Root Cause Addressing**: The framework helps address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences.

### Communication Enhancement
- AI system producers can use the SSDF’s common vocabulary when communicating with AI model producers regarding their security practices for AI model development and when integrating AI models into the software they are developing.
- AI system acquirers can also use SSDF terms to better communicate their cybersecurity requirements and needs to AI model producers and AI system producers, especially during acquisition processes.

### Risk-Based Approach
The SSDF Community Profile is not a checklist to follow but rather a starting point for planning and implementing a risk-based approach to adopting secure software development practices involving AI models. The contents of the Profile are meant to be adapted and customized, as not all practices and tasks are applicable to all use cases.

Organizations should adopt a risk-based approach to determine what practices and tasks are relevant, appropriate, and effective to mitigate the threats to software development practices from the organization’s perspective as an AI model producer, AI system producer, or AI system acquirer. Factors such as risk, cost, feasibility, and applicability should be considered when deciding which practices to implement.# Current Page Raw OCR Text

## Overview

Organizations need to determine which practices and tasks to use and how much time and resources to devote to each one. Cost models may need to be updated to effectively consider the costs inherent to AI model development. A risk-based approach to secure software development may change over time as an organization responds to new or elevated capabilities and risks associated with an AI model or system.

## Challenges with Generative AI

Generative AI and dual-use foundation models present additional challenges in tracking model versioning and lineage. Source code for defining the model architecture and building model binaries is amenable to secure software engineering practices for versioning, lineage, and reproducibility. However, the final model weights are defined only after the model is trained and fine-tuned; this is where limitations in tracking all aspects of collection, processing, and training arise.

## Secure Software Development Practices

Organizations should follow secure software development practices for the parts of a model that can be covered fully and strive to introduce secure practices to the extent possible for the stages and corresponding artifacts where obtaining such security guarantees is hard to achieve. Organizations should document the parts and artifacts that are not covered by the secure software development practices.

## Integration with MLOps

The Profile’s practices, tasks, recommendations, and considerations can be integrated into machine learning operations (MLOps) along with other software assets within a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Shared Responsibility Model

The responsibility for implementing SSDF practices in the Profile may be shared among multiple organizations. For example, an AI model could be produced by one organization and executed within an AI system hosted by a second organization, which is then used by other organizations. In these situations, there is likely a shared responsibility model involving the AI model producer, AI system producer, and AI system acquirer. An AI system acquirer can establish an agreement with an AI system producer and/or AI model producer that specifies which party is responsible for each practice and task and how each party will attest to its conformance with the agreement.

## Limitations of SSDF

A limitation of the SSDF and this Profile is that they only address cybersecurity risk management. There are many other types of risks to AI systems (e.g., data privacy, intellectual property, and bias) that organizations should manage along with cybersecurity risk as part of a mature enterprise risk management program.

## Additional Resources

NIST resources on identifying and managing other types of risk include:

- **AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)** [2] and the **NIST AI RMF Playbook** [11]
- **Adversarial Machine Learning: A Taxonomy and Terminology of Attacks and Mitigations** [3]
- **Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile** [12]
- **Towards a Standard for Identifying and Managing Bias in Artificial Intelligence**# Intelligence

### SSDF Community Profile for AI Model Development

Table 1 defines the SSDF Community Profile for AI Model Development. The meanings of each column are as follows:

- **Practice**: Contains the name of the practice and a unique identifier, followed by a brief explanation of what the practice is and why it is beneficial.
- **Task**: Specifies one or more actions that may be needed to perform a practice. Each task includes a unique identifier and a brief explanation. All practices and tasks are unchanged from SSDF version 1.1 unless they are explicitly tagged as “Modified from SSDF 1.1” or “Not part of SSDF 1.1.” An example is the PW.3 practice, “Confirm the Integrity of Training, Testing, Fine-Tuning, and Aligning Data Before Use” and all of its tasks.
- **Priority**: Reflects the suggested relative importance of each task within the context of the profile and is intended to be a starting point for organizations to assign their own priorities:
- **High**: Critically important for AI model development security compared to other tasks
- **Medium**: Directly supports AI model development security
- **Low**: Beneficial for secure software development but is generally not more important than most other tasks
- **Recommendations, Considerations, and Notes Specific to AI Model Development**: May contain one or more items that recommend what to do or describe additional considerations for a particular task. Organizations are expected to adapt, customize, and omit items as necessary as part of the risk-based approach described in Section 2. Each item has an ID starting with one of the following:
- **R** (recommendation: something the organization should do)
- **C** (consideration: something the organization should consider doing)
- **N** (note: additional information besides recommendations and considerations)

An R, C, or N designation and its number can be appended to the task ID to create a unique identifier (e.g., “PO.1.2.R1” is the first recommendation for task PO.1.2). Note that a value of “No additions to SSDF 1.1” in this column indicates that the Profile does not contain recommendations, considerations, or notes specific to AI model development for the task. Refer to SSDF version 1.1 for baseline guidance on the secure development task in question and to the other references in this document for additional information related to the task.

- **Informative References**: Point (map) to parts of standards, guidance, and other content containing requirements, recommendations, considerations, or other supporting information on performing a particular task. The Informative References come from the following sources:
- AI Risk Management Framework 1.0. Several crosswalks have already been...# AI RMF and Related Guidance

## Overview
The AI RMF (Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework) is defined in conjunction with other guidance and standards. For the current set of crosswalks, please refer to the following link: AI RMF Knowledge Base Crosswalks.

## Key References

### OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications Version 1.1
Each identifier in this document indicates one of the top 10 vulnerability types and may also refer to an individual prevention and mitigation strategy for that vulnerability type.

### Adversarial Machine Learning: A Taxonomy and Terminology of Attacks and Mitigations
This report outlines key types of machine learning attack stages, as well as attacker goals, objectives, and capabilities. It also discusses corresponding methods for mitigating and managing the consequences of attacks.

## Future Considerations
NIST is considering adding a column for **Implementation Examples** in a future version of the Profile. An Implementation Example is a single sentence that suggests a way to accomplish part or all of a task.

- **Recommendations and Considerations**: This column describes the “what.”
- **Implementation Examples**: This would describe options for the “how.”

Such examples would supplement those already defined in SSDF version 1.1. For more information on providing input on additional Informative References and Implementation Examples, please see the Note to Readers.
