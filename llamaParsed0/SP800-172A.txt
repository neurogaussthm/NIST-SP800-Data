# Abstract
The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal systems and organizations is important to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal Government to successfully carry out its assigned missions and business operations. This publication provides federal agencies and nonfederal organizations with assessment procedures that can be used to carry out assessments of the requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-172, Enhanced Security Requirements for Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information: A Supplement to NIST Special Publication 800-171. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be tailored to the needs of organizations and assessors. Assessments can be conducted as:
1. Self-assessments
2. Independent, third-party assessments
3. Government-sponsored assessments

The assessments can be conducted with varying degrees of rigor based on customer-defined depth and coverage attributes. The findings and evidence produced during the assessments can be used to facilitate risk-based decisions by organizations related to the CUI enhanced security requirements.

## Definition and Usage of the Term Information System
Unless specified by legislation, regulation, or government-wide policy, the term system is used in this publication instead of information system. This change reflects a broad-based and holistic definition of systems that includes general-purpose systems, industrial control systems, cyber-physical systems, and individual devices that are part of the Internet of Things. As computing systems and information technologies are deployed ubiquitously worldwide and systems and components are increasingly connected through wired and wireless networks, the susceptibility of Controlled Unclassified Information to loss or compromise grows – as does the potential for adverse consequences resulting from such occurrences.

## Organizational Systems
The term organizational system is used in many of the CUI enhanced security requirements in [SP 800-172] and the associated assessment procedures in this publication. In that context, an organizational system is a nonfederal system that processes, stores, or transmits CUI associated with a critical program or high value asset. Specifically, enhanced security requirements apply to the system components or services that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide security protections for those components or services as mandated by a federal agency in a contract, grant, or other agreement.

# Chapter One
## Introduction
### The Need to Assess Enhanced Security Requirements for CUI
In 2010, Executive Order 13556 established a government-wide Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Program to standardize the way that the executive branch handles unclassified information that requires protection. The regulation that implements the CUI...# Program Overview

## 32 CFR Part 2002
Only federal information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to federal law, regulation, or government-wide policy may be designated as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-172, a supplement to NIST SP 800-171, specifies enhanced security requirements to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CUI when it is associated with a high-value asset or a critical program.

## 1.1 Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of this publication is to describe procedures for assessing the enhanced security requirements in [SP 800-172]. Compliance with the security requirements is addressed in CUI guidance and the CUI Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or as supplemented by federal agencies (e.g., Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation).

Organizations can use the assessment procedures to generate evidence to support the assertion that the enhanced security requirements have been satisfied. The assessment procedures are typically used as part of an assessment process. An assessment process is an information-gathering and evidence-producing activity to determine the effectiveness of the safeguards implemented to meet the set of security requirements specified in [SP 800-172]. The information gathered and evidence produced can be used by an organization to:

- Identify problems or shortfalls in the organization’s security and risk management programs.
- Identify security weaknesses and deficiencies in organizational systems and the environments in which those systems operate.
- Prioritize risk mitigation decisions and activities.
- Confirm that identified security weaknesses and deficiencies in organizational systems and environments of operation have been addressed.
- Support continuous monitoring activities.
- Provide information security situational awareness.

The assessment procedures in this publication offer the flexibility to customize assessments based on organizational policies and requirements, known threat and vulnerability information, system and platform dependencies, operational considerations, and tolerance for risk.

## The Scope of Enhanced Security Requirement Assessments
The scope of the assessments conducted using the procedures described in this publication is guided and informed by the system security plans for the organizational systems processing, storing, or transmitting CUI. The assessments focus on the overall effectiveness of the security safeguards intended to satisfy the enhanced security requirements defined in [SP 800-172].

# CHAPTER TWO: THE FUNDAMENTALS

## Basic Concepts for Assessments of CUI Enhanced Security Requirements
The CUI enhanced security requirements in [SP 800-172] are organized into 10 families, as illustrated in Table 1. The process to assess the CUI enhanced security requirements includes:
- Preparing for assessment
- Developing assessment plans
- Conducting assessments
- Analyzing results

The assessment procedures in Chapter Three are grouped by family designations to help ensure the completeness and consistency of assessments.

### 2.1 Assessment Procedures
An assessment procedure consists of:
- An assessment objective
- A set of potential assessment methods and objects that can be used to conduct the assessment.

Each assessment objective includes a set of determination statements related to the CUI enhanced security requirement that is the subject of the assessment. Organization-defined parameters (ODP) that are part of selected enhanced security requirements are included in the initial determination statements for the assessment procedure. ODPs are included since the specified parameter values are used in subsequent determination statements. ODPs are numbered sequentially and noted in **bold italics**.

Determination statements reflect the content of the enhanced security requirements to ensure traceability of the assessment results to the requirements. The application of an assessment procedure to an enhanced security requirement produces assessment findings. The findings are used to determine if the enhanced security requirement has been satisfied.

Assessment objects are associated with the specific items being assessed. These objects can include...# Specifications, Mechanisms, Activities, and Individuals

## Specifications
Specifications are the document-based artifacts associated with a system, including:
- Security policies
- Procedures
- Plans
- Requirements
- Functional specifications
- Architectural designs

## Mechanisms
Mechanisms refer to the specific hardware, software, or firmware safeguards employed within a system.

## Activities
Activities are the protection-related actions supporting a system that involve people, such as:
- Conducting system backup operations
- Exercising a contingency plan
- Monitoring network traffic

## Individuals
Individuals are the people who apply the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.

# Assessment Methods

Assessment methods define the nature and extent of the assessor’s actions. The methods include:

## Examine
The examine method involves:
- Reviewing
- Inspecting
- Observing
- Studying
- Analyzing assessment objects (i.e., mechanisms, activities, specifications)

## Interview
The interview method consists of holding discussions with individuals or groups to:
- Facilitate understanding
- Achieve clarification
- Obtain evidence

## Test
The test method is the process of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities, mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior.

### Purpose of Assessment Methods
The purpose of the assessment methods is to:
- Facilitate understanding
- Achieve clarification
- Obtain evidence

The results obtained from applying these methods are used for making specific determinations called for in the determination statements, thereby achieving the objectives for the assessment procedure.

# Attributes of Assessment Methods

The assessment methods described above have associated attributes of depth and coverage, which affect the level of effort for the assessment. These attributes provide a means to define the rigor and scope of the assessment to obtain the assurance needed for enhanced security requirements. A description of assessment methods and objects is provided in Appendix C.

## Example of Assessment Procedure
Figure 1 illustrates an example of an assessment procedure for the CUI enhanced security requirement 3.1.3e from [SP 800-172].

# Organizational Flexibility
Organizations are not expected to use all of the assessment methods and objects contained within the assessment procedures identified in this publication. Instead, organizations have the flexibility to establish:
- The level of effort needed
- The assurance required for an assessment

The decision on the level of effort is made based on how the organization can accomplish the assessment objectives in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, with sufficient confidence to support the determination that the CUI enhanced security requirements have been satisfied.

# Organization-Defined Parameters
Selected enhanced security requirements contain selection and assignment operations to give...# Organizations Flexibility in Defining Variable Parts of Requirements

## Selection Operations
Selection operations require organizations to select from a list of predefined items. Assignment operations require organizations to define specific parameter values. Determination statements for organization-defined parameters (ODP) are listed first in the assessment objective section, followed by the list of determination statements for the assessment objective. Determination statements for ODPs are noted in **bold italics**. The ODP values are used in the appropriate determination statements in the assessment procedure, also noted in **bold italics**.

## 2.2 Assurance Cases
Building an effective assurance case for determining compliance with the enhanced security requirements is a process that involves compiling evidence from a variety of sources and conducting different types of assessment activities. An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into an argument demonstrating that some claim about a system is true.

For the assessments conducted using the procedures in this publication, that claim is compliance with the enhanced security requirements specified in [SP 800-172]. Assessors obtain evidence during the assessment process to allow designated officials to make objective determinations about compliance with the CUI enhanced security requirements. The evidence needed to make such determinations can be obtained from various sources, including self-assessments, independent third-party assessments, government-sponsored assessments, or other types of assessments, depending on the needs of the organization establishing the requirements and the organization conducting the assessments.

For example, some enhanced security requirements are satisfied by security capabilities built into commercial information technology products and systems. Product assessments are typically conducted by independent, third-party testing organizations. These assessments examine the security functions of the products and the established configuration settings. Assessments can also be conducted to demonstrate compliance with industry, national, or international security standards, as well as developer and vendor claims. Since many information technology products are assessed by commercial testing organizations and then subsequently deployed in hundreds of thousands of systems, these assessments can be carried out at a greater level of depth and provide deeper insights into the security capabilities of the products.

Ultimately, the evidence needed to determine compliance comes from the implementation of the safeguards to satisfy the enhanced security requirements and from the assessments of that implementation. Assessors can build on previously developed artifacts that started with the specification of the organization’s information security needs and is further developed during the design, development, and implementation of the system and system components.# Security Assessment Overview

These artifacts, obtained while implementing security throughout the system development life cycle, provide the initial evidence for an assurance case. Assessments can be conducted by:

- System developers
- System integrators
- System owners
- Evaluators
- Auditors
- Security staff of organizations

The assessors or assessment teams begin by obtaining and reviewing the results from individual component product or compliance assessments. The assessors then determine the additional system-level assessments required to achieve the needed assurance using the procedures and methods contained in this publication and based on the specific implementation information provided by nonfederal organizations in their system security plans.

Assessments can be used to compile and evaluate the evidence needed by organizations to determine:

- The effectiveness of the safeguards implemented to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
- The actions needed to mitigate security-related risks
- Compliance with the enhanced security requirements

## Security Assessment Plans

The system security plan is used to describe how the organization meets or plans to meet the CUI enhanced security requirements. Once the organization completes the system security plan, a security assessment plan can be developed using the appropriate assessment procedures described in Chapter Three.

An assessment procedure is developed for each enhanced security requirement that is selected for the system or system component. The assessment procedures can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the organization. [SP 800-53A] provides additional information on how organizations can prepare for assessments, develop assessment plans, conduct assessments, and analyze results.

# Chapter Three: The Procedures

## Assessment Procedures, Methods, and Objects for Enhanced Security Requirements

This chapter provides assessment procedures for the CUI enhanced security requirements defined in [SP 800-172]. The assessment procedures are organized into 10 families, as illustrated in Table 1.

Plans for conducting enhanced security requirement assessments are built using the information provided in the assessment procedures – selecting the assessment methods and objects that meet the desired assurance requirements. Organizations also have flexibility in defining the level of rigor and detail associated with the assessment based on those assurance requirements. Appendix C provides additional information on the levels of rigor and detail for assessments.

The assessment objective for an assessment procedure is achieved by applying the designated assessment methods to the selected assessment objects and producing the evidence necessary to make the determination associated with the objective. Each determination statement produces a finding of either satisfied or other than satisfied.# Assessment Findings and Security Requirements

## Overview
The assessment findings indicate the level of satisfaction regarding security requirements addressed by determination statements.

### Satisfied Findings
- A finding of "satisfied" indicates that the assessment information obtained (i.e., the evidence collected) demonstrates that the assessment objective has been met, producing a fully acceptable result.

### Unsatisfied Findings
- A finding of other than "satisfied" indicates that:
- The assessment findings demonstrate potential anomalies that may need to be addressed by the organization.
- The assessor may have been unable to obtain sufficient information to make the determination for reasons described in the assessment report.

## Subcategories of Findings
For assessment findings that are other than satisfied, organizations may define subcategories of findings that indicate:
- The severity or criticality of the weaknesses or deficiencies discovered.
- Potential adverse impacts on organizational missions or business functions.

These subcategories can help establish priorities for needed risk mitigation actions.

## Cautionary Note
This publication can be used for various assessment-related purposes in determining whether implementing organizations satisfy the CUI enhanced security requirements in [SP 800-172]. Organizations have the flexibility to tailor the assessment procedures by selecting the assessment methods and objects needed to achieve the stated assessment objectives.

### Key Points
- There is no expectation that every assessment method and object in an assessment procedure will be used for every assessment.
- The list of potential assessment objects should not be viewed as required artifacts needed to determine compliance with the requirements.
