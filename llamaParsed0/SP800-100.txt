# Information Security Handbook

## Chapter 1

### 1. Introduction
This Information Security Handbook provides a broad overview of information security program elements to assist managers in understanding how to establish and implement an information security program. Typically, the organization looks to the program for overall responsibility to ensure the selection and implementation of appropriate security controls and to demonstrate the effectiveness of satisfying their stated security requirements.

The topics within this document were selected based on the laws and regulations relevant to information security, including the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130. The material in this handbook can be referenced for general information on a particular topic or can be used in the decision-making process for developing an information security program. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NISTIR) Interagency Report 7298 provides a summary glossary for the basic security terms used throughout this document. While reading this handbook, please consider that the guidance is not specific to a particular agency. Agencies should tailor this guidance according to their security posture and business requirements.

#### 1.1 Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of this publication is to inform members of the information security management team (agency heads; chief information officers [CIOs]; senior agency information security officers [SAISOs], also commonly referred to as Chief Information Security Officers [CISOs]; and security managers) about various aspects of information security that they will be expected to implement and oversee in their respective organizations. In addition, the handbook provides guidance for facilitating a more consistent approach to information security programs across the federal government. Even though the terminology in this document is geared toward the federal sector, the handbook can also be used to provide guidance on a variety of other governmental, organizational, or institutional security requirements.

#### 1.2 Relationship to Existing Guidance
This handbook summarizes and augments a number of existing NIST standards and guidance documents and provides additional information on related topics. Such documents are referenced within appropriate subchapters.

#### 1.3 Audience
The intended audience includes agency heads, CIOs, SAISOs (also commonly referred to as CISOs), and security managers. The handbook provides information that the audience can use in building their information security program strategy. While there are differences between federal and private sector environments, especially in terms of priorities and legal requirements, the underlying principles of information security are the same. The handbook is therefore useful to any manager who requires a broad overview of information security practices.

## Chapter 2

### 2. Information Security Governance
Federal agencies rely heavily on information technology (IT) to run their daily operations and deliver products and services. With an increasing reliability on IT, a growing complexity of federal government IT infrastructure, and a constantly changing information security threat and risk environment, information security has...# Information Security Governance

## Introduction
Information security has become a mission-essential function that must be managed and governed to reduce risks to federal government operations and ensure the federal government's ability to conduct business and serve the American public.

## Purpose of Information Security Governance
The purpose of information security governance is to ensure that agencies are proactively implementing appropriate information security controls to support their mission in a cost-effective manner while managing evolving information security risks. Information security governance encompasses its own set of requirements, challenges, activities, and possible structures. It plays a defining role in identifying key information security roles and responsibilities, influencing information security policy development, oversight, and ongoing monitoring activities.

## Establishing a Governance Structure
To ensure an appropriate level of support for agency missions and the proper implementation of current and future information security requirements, each agency should establish a formal information security governance structure.

### Definition
Information security governance can be defined as the process of establishing and maintaining a framework and supporting management structure and processes to provide assurance that information security strategies are aligned with and support business objectives. It ensures consistency with applicable laws and regulations through adherence to policies and internal controls, and provides assignment of responsibility, all in an effort to manage risk.

## Information Security Governance Requirements

### Legislative Framework
The United States (U.S.) Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have instituted a number of laws, regulations, and directives that govern the establishment and implementation of federal information security practices. These laws, regulations, and directives:

- Establish federal- and agency-level responsibilities for information security.
- Define key information security roles and responsibilities.
- Identify minimum information security controls.
- Specify compliance reporting rules and procedures.
- Provide other essential requirements and guidance.

### Accountability
These laws and regulations place responsibility and accountability for information security at all levels within federal agencies, from the agency head to IT users. They also provide an infrastructure for developing and promulgating detailed standards and implementation guidance to federal agencies and overseeing the implementation of required practices through NIST and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

### Influencing Entities
The three entities—U.S. Congress, OMB, and GAO—define and influence federal agency governance and information security requirements:

- **Congress** creates laws and oversight measures to establish objectives, present timely analyses to establish overall governance standards across the federal government, and provide aid in economic and budget decisions, including decisions about public IT assets and the funds needed to secure them. Agencies must establish clear reporting requirements that meet legislative requirements set by Congress and provide necessary information and estimates for the congressional budget process.

- **OMB** assists the President in overseeing the preparation of the federal budget and supervises its administration by the executive branch agencies. OMB provides further guidance to the agencies on implementing legislative information requirements in the form of circulars and memoranda.

- **GAO** provides oversight of agency information security activities as part of its mission to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities.# Improving Federal Government Performance and Accountability

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) aims to help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people. GAO reviews agency implementation of legislative and regulatory requirements and reports to Congress and the American public on its findings.

## Information Security Governance

At a minimum, information security governance in a federal department or agency must meet the requirements as they are detailed in applicable legislation, regulations, and directives. Furthermore, agencies can benefit from identifying overall good governance practices for establishing strong management and oversight. Agencies should tailor their information security governance practices to their organization’s own missions, operations, and needs.

### Key Legislative Acts Defining Federal Agency Governance Requirements

1. **The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993**
- Establishes the foundation for budget decision making to achieve strategic goals in order to meet agency mission objectives.

2. **The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995**
- Requires agencies to perform their information resource management activities in an efficient, effective, and economical manner.

3. **The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) of 1996**
- Requires accountability of financial and program managers for financial results of actions taken, control over the federal government's financial resources, and protection of federal assets.

4. **The Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982**
- Requires ongoing evaluations and reports from each executive on the adequacy of administrative control for internal accounting systems.

5. **The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996**
- Requires agencies to use a disciplined capital planning and investment control (CPIC) process to acquire, use, maintain, and dispose of IT resources, and establishes a role of chief information officer (CIO) within each federal agency.

6. **The E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347)**
- Promotes better use of the Internet and other IT resources to improve government services for citizens and internal government operations, and provide opportunities for citizen participation in government. The Act also requires agencies to:
- Comply with FISMA, included as Title III of the E-Government Act.
- Support governmentwide e-government initiatives.
- Leverage cross-agency opportunities to further e-government through the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) initiative.
- Conduct and submit to OMB privacy impact assessments for all new IT investments administering information in identifiable form collected from or about members of the public.

### Foundational Sources for Information Security Governance Requirements

Supporting these acts, three legislative documents emerge as the foundational sources for specific information security governance requirements:

1. **The Federal Information Security Management (FISMA) Act**
- The primary legislation governing federal information security programs, building upon earlier legislation through added emphasis on the management dimension of information security.
- Delegates to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) the responsibility to develop detailed information security standards and guidance for federal information systems, with the exception of national security systems.
- Designates to OMB the oversight of federal agencies’ information security implementation.
- Provides a comprehensive framework for securing federal government IT resources, including defining key federal government and agency roles and responsibilities, requiring agencies to integrate information security into their capital planning and enterprise architecture processes, requiring agencies to conduct annual information security reviews of all programs and systems, and reporting the results of those reviews to OMB.

2. **OMB Circular A-130**
- Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix.# III. Security of Federal Automated Information Resources

## Overview
The security of federal automated information resources establishes a minimum set of controls to be included in federal automated information security programs. It assigns federal agency responsibilities for the security of automated information and links agency automated information security programs with agency management control systems.

## Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12)
Released in August 2004, HSPD-12 specifies a policy for a common identification standard for all Federal employees and contractors. The directive aims to increase identification security and interoperability by standardizing the process for issuing identification credentials to Federal employees and contractors. It also specifies the electronic and physical properties of the credential itself, known as the Personal Identity Verification card.

!Figure 2-1
*Figure 2-1 illustrates key roles of legislative, regulatory, and oversight bodies in establishing governance and information security governance requirements for the federal enterprise.*

## Information Security Governance Practices
The need to identify and implement appropriate federal government and agency-specific information security governance practices can be daunting. Agencies should identify applicable requirements based on relevant legislation, regulations, federal directives, and agency-level directives. Furthermore, agencies should ensure that information security governance structures are implemented in a manner that best supports their unique missions and operations.

### 2.2 Information Security Governance Components
Agencies should integrate their information security governance activities with the overall agency structure and activities by ensuring appropriate participation of agency officials in overseeing the implementation of information security controls throughout the agency. The key activities that facilitate such integration include:

- Strategic planning
- Organizational design and development
- Establishment of roles and responsibilities
- Integration with the enterprise architecture
- Documentation of security objectives in policies and guidance

!Figure 2-2
*Figure 2-2 illustrates the relative relationship of these various components.*

### 2.2.1 Information Security Strategic Planning
"Strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual program performance reports are the main elements of GPRA. Together these elements create a recurring cycle of reporting, planning, and execution."

GPRA requires federal agencies to develop and submit to OMB and Congress a strategic plan for program activities and to prepare an annual performance plan covering each program activity set forth in the agency's budget. Agencies are required to refresh their strategic plans within three years of submitting their previous plans, while submitting performance plans is required annually.

Agencies should integrate information security into the agency strategic planning processes by establishing and documenting information security strategies that directly support agency strategic and performance planning activities. The organization’s information security strategy should establish a comprehensive framework to enable the development, institutionalization, assessment, and improvement of the agency’s information security program. The information security strategy should support the overall agency strategic and performance plans and IT strategic plan (if applicable), with its content clearly traceable to these higher-level sources. Each agency should define the following for its information security program:# Information Security Strategic Planning

## Mission, Vision, Goals, and Objectives
- Clear and comprehensive mission, vision, goals, and objectives and how they relate to agency mission.
- High-level plan for achieving information security goals and objectives, including short- and mid-term objectives and performance targets, specific for each goal and objective, to be used throughout the life of this plan to manage progress toward successfully fulfilling the identified objectives.
- Performance measures to continuously monitor accomplishment of identified goals and objectives and their progress toward stated targets.

Agencies should document their information security strategy in an information security strategic plan or another document, if appropriate. Regardless of how the information security strategy is documented, its contents should be aligned with the overall agency strategic planning activities. The document should be revisited when a major change in the agency information security environment occurs, including:
- Change in applicable legislation, regulations, or directives.
- Change in agency mission priorities.
- Emerging information security issues, such as changes in threat and vulnerability environment or the introduction of new technologies.

## Information Security Governance Structures
Information security governance structures can be characterized in a number of ways. There are two basic models of information security governance structures: centralized and decentralized. While agency heads are ultimately responsible for managing and governing their respective agency, the authority and responsibility over information security differs in the two types of structures. Key characteristics of the two structures are:

### Centralized
- Departmental CIO or, in some instances, the SAISO has line-item budget control over all information security activities throughout the department.
- All information security practitioners within the department report to the departmental SAISO, who is responsible for ensuring implementation and monitoring of information security controls throughout the entire department.

### Decentralized
- Departmental SAISOs have policy development and oversight responsibilities.
- Departmental SAISOs have budget responsibilities over the departmental information security program, but not over the operating units’ information security programs.
- Operating unit SAISOs report to the unit head, not to the departmental SAISO. Operating unit SAISOs are responsible for implementing and monitoring information security practices within their respective operating units.

Completely centralized or decentralized information security governance implementations are quite rare. In reality, the variety of implemented information security governance structures spans the continuum from a centralized structure at one end to a decentralized structure at the other. Agencies usually adopt hybrid structures that include some characteristics of both centralized and decentralized types of structures, and they adopt the particular mix of these characteristics to fit their agency mission, size, homogeneity of their components, and existing governance structure.

Agencies in the process of establishing or changing their information security governance structure should consider the following key factors to determine the optimal extent of the centralization or decentralization:
- Agency size.
- Agency mission and its level of diversification or homogeneity.
- Existing agency IT infrastructure.
- Existing federal and internal governance requirements.
- Size of agency budget.
- Agency information security capabilities.
- Number of, and distance between, physical locations.
- Decision-making practices and desired rate of change in information security.# Information Security Governance

To the degree that these factors are limited or varied, an organization’s hybrid information security governance structure will fall somewhere between the extremes of a completely centralized or decentralized structure, as depicted in Figure 2-3. An organization’s placement on this continuum may also shift over time in response to changing internal factors or external requirements.

Since information security governance structure is highly dependent on the overall organizational structure, organizations are often limited in their choices about how to organize their information security governance activities. Agencies should be cognizant of the characteristics and challenges that a centralized or decentralized structure presents and work within their respective organizations to ensure the best use of information security resources within the boundaries of their own structure.

## 2.2.3 Key Governance Roles and Responsibilities

There are several governance stakeholders common to most organizations that span the organization. These stakeholders include senior leadership, a Chief Information Officer (CIO), information security personnel, and a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), among others. The specific requirements of each role may differ with the degree of information security governance centralization or in response to the specific missions and needs of an organization.

### 2.2.3.1 Agency Head

The Clinger-Cohen Act assigns the responsibility for ensuring that the information security policies, procedures, and practices of the executive agency are adequate. FISMA provides the following details on agency head responsibilities for information security:

- Providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information collected or maintained by or on behalf of an agency, and on information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency;
- Ensuring that an information security program is developed, documented, and implemented to provide security for all systems, networks, and data that support the operations of the organization;
- Ensuring that information security processes are integrated with strategic and operational planning processes to secure the organization’s mission;
- Ensuring that senior agency officials within the organization are given the necessary authority to secure the operations and assets under their control;
- Designating a CIO and delegating authority to that individual to ensure compliance with applicable information security requirements;
- Ensuring that the agency has trained personnel to support compliance with information security policies, processes, standards, and guidelines; and
- Ensuring that the CIO, in coordination with the other senior agency officials, reports annually to the agency head on the effectiveness of the agency information security program, including the progress of remedial actions.

### 2.2.3.2 Chief Information Officer

FISMA assigns the agency CIO the following responsibilities:

- Designating a senior agency information security officer (SAISO);
- Developing and maintaining an agency-wide information security program;
- Developing and maintaining information security policies, procedures, and guidelines.# Information Security Roles and Responsibilities

## 2.2.3.3 Senior Agency Information Security Officer

FISMA assigns the Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO) the following responsibilities:

- Performing information security duties as the primary duty.
- Heading an office with the mission and resources to assist in ensuring agency compliance with information security requirements.
- Periodically assessing risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.
- Developing and maintaining risk-based, cost-effective information security policies, procedures, and control techniques to address all applicable requirements throughout the life cycle of each agency information system to ensure compliance with applicable requirements.
- Facilitating development of subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for networks, facilities, and systems or groups of information systems.
- Ensuring that agency personnel, including contractors, receive appropriate information security awareness training.
- Training and overseeing personnel with significant responsibilities for information security with respect to such responsibilities.
- Periodically testing and evaluating the effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, and practices.
- Establishing and maintaining a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial action to address any deficiencies in the information security policies, procedures, and practices of the agency.
- Developing and implementing procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents.
- Ensuring preparation and maintenance of plans and procedures to provide continuity of operations for information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.
- Supporting the agency CIO in annual reporting to the agency head on the effectiveness of the agency information security program, including progress of remedial actions.

## 2.2.3.4 Chief Enterprise Architect

The Chief Enterprise Architect or comparable position in an organization is responsible for:

- Leading agency enterprise architecture development and implementation efforts.
- Collaborating with lines of business within the agency to ensure proper integration of lines of business into enterprise architecture.
- Participating in agency strategic planning and performance planning activities to ensure proper integration of enterprise architecture.
- Facilitating integration of information security into all layers of enterprise architecture to ensure agency implementation of secure solutions.
- Working closely with the program managers, the Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO), and the business owners to ensure that all technical architecture requirements are adequately addressed by applying FEA and the Security and Privacy Profile (SPP).

## 2.2.3.5 Related Roles

Many other individuals within an organization have a stake in information security, from top senior management down to individual users. A few of the primary senior management roles and their coinciding responsibilities are listed below. The scope of each role will depend on whether or not these roles should be...# Information Security Governance Roles

## Inspector General (IG)
The IG is a statutory office within an organization that, in addition to other responsibilities, works to assess an organization’s information security practices and identifies vulnerabilities and the possible need to modify security measures. The IG completes this task by:
- Detecting fraud or instances of waste, abuse, or misuse of an organization’s funds;
- Identifying operational deficiencies within the organization;
- Ensuring that the underlying problems that permit such failings are rectified; and
- Offering recommendations for preventing problems in the future.

## Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
The CFO is the senior financial advisor to the investment review board (IRB) and the agency head. Information security investments fall within the purview of the CFO and are included in the CFO’s reports. In this capacity, the CFO is responsible for:
- Reviewing cost goals of each major information security investment;
- Reporting financial management information to OMB as part of the President’s budget;
- Complying with legislative and OMB-defined responsibilities as they relate to IT capital investments;
- Reviewing systems that impact financial management activities; and
- Forwarding investment assessments to the IRB.

## Chief Privacy Officer
The Chief Privacy Officer is responsible for privacy compliance across an organization, including privacy compliance measures that apply to information security assets and activities. The Chief Privacy Officer works to maintain a balance between security and privacy requirements, ensuring that one is not compromised for the sake of the other. To this end, the Chief Privacy Officer serves as the senior official responsible for:
- Developing, promoting, and supporting the organization’s privacy programs;
- Encouraging awareness of potential privacy issues and policies; and
- Reviewing and implementing privacy regulations and legislation.

## Physical Security Officer
The Physical Security Officer is responsible for the overall implementation and management of physical security controls across an organization, including integration with applicable information security controls. As information security programs are developed, senior agency officials should work to ensure this coordination of complementary controls. In consideration of information security, the Physical Security Officer serves as the senior official responsible for:
- Developing, promulgating, implementing, and monitoring the organization’s physical security programs, including appropriate controls for alternate work sites;
- Ensuring organizational implementation and monitoring of access controls (i.e., authorization, access, visitor control, transmission medium, display medium).# Information Security Responsibilities

## Personnel Security Officer

The Personnel Security Officer or other designated official with personnel security responsibilities is often part of the Human Resources or Human Capital organization. This officer is responsible for the overall implementation and management of personnel security controls across an organization, including integration with specific information security controls.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Developing, promulgating, implementing, and monitoring the organization’s personnel security programs.
- Developing and implementing position categorization (including third-party controls), access agreements, and personnel screening, termination, and transfers.
- Ensuring consistent and appropriate sanctions for personnel violating management, operation, or technical information security controls.

## Acquisitions/Contracting

The Acquisitions/Contracting function is responsible for managing contracts and overseeing their implementation. Personnel executing this function have the following responsibilities regarding information security:

### Key Responsibilities:
- Collaborating with the agency’s Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO) or other appropriate official to ensure that the agency’s contracting policies adequately address the agency’s information security requirements.
- Coordinating with the SAISO or other appropriate official as required to ensure that all agency contracts and procurements are compliant with the agency’s information security policy.
- Ensuring that all personnel with responsibilities in the agency’s procurement process are properly trained in information security.
- In concert with the SAISO, facilitating the monitoring of contract performance for compliance with the agency’s information security policy.

## Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA)

FEA is a business-based framework for governmentwide improvement. The purpose of FEA is to facilitate cross-agency analyses and identify duplicative investments, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration within and across federal agencies. FEA helps identify duplicative or wasteful investments, areas where investments should be made, and where departments and agencies can collaborate to improve government operations or services.

### Reference Models of FEA:
1. **Performance Reference Model (PRM)**: A common framework for performance measurement that can be applied throughout the FEA.
2. **Business Reference Model (BRM)**: A function-driven framework for describing the business operations of the federal government independent of the agencies.
3. **Service Component Reference Model (SRM)**: A business- and performance-driven functional framework that classifies service components with respect to how they support business and/or performance objectives.
4. **Data and Information Reference Model (DRM)**: Describes, at an aggregate level, the data and information that support program and business line operations.
5. **Technical Reference Model (TRM)**: A component-driven technical framework used to identify the standards, specifications, and technologies that support and enable the delivery of service components and capabilities.

### Integration of Security
OMB requires agencies to integrate security into their enterprise architecture.# Information Security Integration in Agency Enterprise Architecture

## Benefits of Integrating Information Security

The integration of information security into the agency enterprise architecture efforts provides several benefits to both the agencies and the federal government:

### Reduction of Reporting Burden
The Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) requires agencies to collect and analyze significant amounts of data. Ongoing security efforts can provide relevant information regarding data, technology, and performance metrics throughout a department. This includes information from:
- FISMA quarterly and annual reports
- Accreditation letters
- Plans of Actions and Milestones (POA&M)

### Integration of Security Data
Organizations should utilize existing information security data sources to identify data for their FEA submissions. This approach allows for a continuous and reliable transmission and roll-up of security requirements and controls from initial security certification and accreditation documentation and POA&Ms into the FEA.

### Preservation of Security Requirements
Documenting and preserving information about applicable security requirements ensures its use in higher-level federal management or decision-making processes. For instance:
- If the federal government attempts a large-scale reorganization (e.g., creating a new department or agency), a security-aware FEA can outline intersections of common business lines and corresponding security requirements.
- If a department mandates a specific technological tool, the FEA can highlight the security and privacy requirements for that technology and the data it handles.

Given the numerous IT-related efforts underway in the federal government, including critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and Continuity of Operations (COOP) processes, a security-enabled FEA supports these efforts while ensuring appropriate protection of information.

## Information Security Policy and Guidance

### Overview
Information security policy is a collection of directives, rules, and practices that dictate how an organization manages, protects, and distributes information. It is a crucial component of information security governance; without it, governance lacks substance and enforceable rules.

### Foundations of Information Security Policy
Information security policy should be based on:
- Relevant legislation (e.g., FISMA)
- Applicable standards (e.g., NIST Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS))
- Internal agency requirements

### Key Components of Agency Information Security Policy
Agency information security policy should address the fundamentals of the agency's information security governance structure, including:
- Information security roles and responsibilities
- Statement of security controls baseline and rules for exceeding the baseline
- Rules of behavior expected from agency users and minimum repercussions for noncompliance

### Supporting Guidance and Procedures
Agencies should develop supporting guidance and procedures to effectively implement specific controls across the enterprise. This guidance, created by the agency in consideration of external sources (e.g., NIST Special Publications and OMB memoranda), should align with the information security policy and not supersede it unless the policy itself is modified.

### Keeping Information Security Policy Current
To prevent obsolescence, agencies should ensure that their information security policy is sufficiently current to accommodate the evolving information security environment and the agency's mission and operational requirements.# Information Security Policy Review and Revision Cycle

## 1. Policy Review and Revision Cycle
Implement a policy review and revision cycle. As a part of the periodic review and the initial development of the information security policies, agencies should work to ensure that all internal security policies (i.e., physical and personnel) are sufficiently coordinated to ensure effective implementation of crosscutting and convergent security objectives, such as access control initiatives.

## 2. Ongoing Monitoring
An effective information security governance program requires constant review. Agencies should monitor the status of their programs to ensure that:

- Ongoing information security activities are providing appropriate support to the agency mission;
- Policies and procedures are current and aligned with evolving technologies, if appropriate; and
- Controls are accomplishing their intended purpose.

Over time, policies and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in agency mission and operational requirements, threats, environment, deterioration in the degree of compliance, changes in technology or infrastructure, or business processes. Periodic assessments and reports on activities can be a valuable means of identifying areas of noncompliance, reminding users of their responsibilities, and demonstrating management's commitment to the security program.

While an organization’s mission does not frequently change, the agency may expand its mission to secure agency programs and assets and, by extension, require modification to its information security requirements and practices. It is important that a change in an organization’s internal requirements is checked against external federal requirements as, for example, a change to an information system’s security posture may alter its subsequent reporting requirements.

To facilitate ongoing monitoring, the SAISO and other officials can compare and correlate a variety of real-time and static information available from a number of ongoing activities within and outside of their programs. FISMA requires agencies to perform an annual assessment of their information security programs and report information security performance measures quarterly and annually. The intent of these reporting requirements is to facilitate close to real-time assessment and monitoring of information security program activities.

Ongoing monitoring combines the use of existing data to oversee a security program and typically occurs throughout all phases of the program life cycle. Agencies can use a variety of data originating from the ongoing information security program activities to monitor performance of programs under their purview, including POA&Ms, performance measurements and metrics, continuous assessment, configuration management and control, network monitoring, and incident statistics.

### Table 2-1
Provides a broad overview of key ongoing activities that can assist in monitoring and improving an agency’s information governance activities.

## 3. Information Security Governance Challenges and Keys to Success
There are many diverse, and sometimes conflicting, priorities an organization must account for in meeting information security governance requirements. These criteria present challenges an organization is likely to face in its efforts to establish information security governance.

### Common Challenges
Some of the most common challenges include:

- Balancing extensive requirements originating from multiple governing bodies.# Information Security Governance

Several different governing and oversight bodies establish governance and information security requirements for the federal government. While these requirements are seldom contradictory, they are not always complementary, and organizations may be faced with the challenge of implementing different compliance measures and monitoring these measures for reporting purposes.

## Key Challenges

- **Balancing legislation and agency-specific policy:** Agencies may have more stringent requirements that go beyond those required by information security legislation, regulation, and directives.
- **Maintaining currency:** Governance standards and guidance evolve to support different requirements, and new legislation is frequently introduced.
- **Prioritizing available funding according to requirements:** Increased competition for limited federal budgets and resources requires that agencies allocate available funding toward their highest-priority information security investments.

## Information Security Governance Framework

Information security governance provides a framework for establishing and maintaining an information security program that will evolve with the organization it supports. The following list is a summary of good information security governance practices that are critical for ensuring the security of enterprise information assets:

- Information security activities should be governed based on relevant requirements, including laws, regulations, and organizational policies.
- Senior managers should be actively involved in establishing the information security governance framework and the act of governing the agency’s implementation of information security.
- Information security responsibilities must be assigned and carried out by appropriately trained individuals.
- Individuals responsible for information security within the agency should be held accountable for their actions or lack of actions.
- Information security priorities should be communicated to stakeholders of all levels within an organization to ensure a successful implementation of an information security program.
- Information security activities must be integrated into other management activities of the enterprise, including strategic planning, capital planning, and enterprise architecture.
- The information security organization structure should be appropriate for the organization it supports and should evolve with the organization if the organization undergoes change.
- Information security managers should continuously monitor the performance of the security program/effort for which they are responsible, using available tools and information.
- Information discovered through monitoring should be used as an input into management decisions about priorities and funding allocation to effect the improvement of security posture and the overall performance of the organization.

# Chapter 3: System Development Life Cycle

The system development life cycle (SDLC) is the overall process of developing, implementing, and retiring information systems through a multistep process from initiation, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance to disposal. There are many different SDLC models and methodologies, but each generally consists of a series of defined steps or phases.

Various SDLC methodologies have been developed to guide the processes involved, and some methods work better than others for specific types of projects. Regardless of the type of the life cycle used by an organization, information security must be integrated into the SDLC to ensure appropriate protection for the information that the system is intended to transmit, process, and store.# Security Integration into the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Integrating security into the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is most useful and cost-effective when it begins with a system development or integration project initiation and continues throughout the SDLC, including system disposal. A number of federal laws and directives require integrating security into the SDLC, including the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III.

This section provides a general overview of security integration into the SDLC and is not intended to prescribe any particular model or methodology. Each phase of the SDLC includes a minimum set of information security-related activities required to effectively incorporate security into a system. An organization can either use a generic SDLC as described in this section or develop a tailored SDLC that meets its specific needs. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-64 Rev. 1, *Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle*, presents a framework for incorporating security into all phases of the SDLC, ensuring the selection, acquisition, and use of appropriate and cost-effective security controls.

## 3.1 Initiation Phase

All information technology (IT) projects have a starting point, commonly referred to as the initiation phase. During this phase, the organization establishes the need for a particular system and documents its purpose. The information to be processed, transmitted, or stored is typically evaluated, as well as who is required access to such information and how (in high-level terms).

In addition, it is often determined whether the project will be an independent information system or a component of an already-defined system. A preliminary risk assessment is typically conducted in this phase, and security planning documents are initiated (system security plan).

Once these tasks have been completed and a need has been recognized for a new or enhanced IT product or service, several processes must take place before the project is approved, including clearly defining project goals and high-level information security requirements. Typically, during this phase, the organization defines high-level information security policy requirements as well as the enterprise security system architecture.

## 3.2 Development/Acquisition Phase

During this phase, the system is designed, purchased, programmed, developed, or otherwise constructed. This phase often consists of other defined cycles, such as the system development cycle or the acquisition cycle.

During the first part of the development/acquisition phase, the organization should simultaneously define the system’s security and functional requirements. These requirements can be expressed as technical features (e.g., access control), assurances (e.g., background checks for system developers), or operational practices (e.g., awareness and training).

During the last part of this phase, the organization should perform developmental testing of the technical and security features/functions to ensure that they perform as intended prior to launching the system.# Implementation and Integration Phase

## 3.3 Implementation Phase
In the implementation phase, the organization configures and enables system security features, tests the functionality of these features, installs or implements the system, and finally, obtains a formal authorization to operate the system. Design reviews and system tests should be performed before placing the system into operation to ensure that it meets all required security specifications.

In addition, if new controls are added to the application or the support system, additional acceptance tests of those new controls must be performed. This approach ensures that new controls meet security specifications and do not conflict with or invalidate existing controls. The results of the design reviews and system tests should be fully documented, updated as new reviews or tests are performed, and maintained in the official organization records.

## 3.4 Operations/Maintenance Phase
An effective security program demands comprehensive and continuous understanding of program and system weaknesses. In the operation and maintenance phase, systems and products are in place and operating, enhancements and/or modifications to the system are developed and tested, and hardware and/or software is added or replaced.

During this phase, the organization should continuously monitor performance of the system to ensure that it is consistent with preestablished user and security requirements, and needed system modifications are incorporated. For configuration management (CM) and control, it is important to document the proposed or actual changes in the security plan of the system.

Information systems are typically in a constant state of evolution with upgrades to hardware, software, firmware, and possible modifications to the surrounding environment where the system resides. Documenting information system changes and assessing the potential impact of these changes on the security of a system is an essential part of continuous monitoring, and key to avoiding a lapse in the system security accreditation.

Monitoring security controls helps to identify potential security-related problems in the information system that are not identified during the security impact analysis, which is conducted as part of the CM and control process.

## 3.5 Disposal Phase
The disposal phase of the system life cycle refers to the process of preserving (if applicable) and discarding system information, hardware, and software. This step is extremely important because during this phase, information, hardware, and software are moved to another system, archived, discarded, or destroyed.

If performed improperly, the disposal phase can result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. When archiving information, organizations should consider the need and methods for future retrieval. While electronic information is relatively easy to store and retrieve, problems can arise if the technology used to create the records is no longer available in the future as a result of obsolescence or incompatibility with new technologies.

Additionally, the organization should consider what measures must be taken to ensure the security of the data during the disposal process.# Information Security Guidelines

## 1. Data Encryption and Storage
- Steps must be taken to ensure the secure long-term storage of cryptographic keys.
- Legal requirements for records retention should be considered when disposing of information systems.
- Federal system management officials should consult with their office responsible for retaining and archiving federal records.

## 2. Media Sanitization
- The removal of information from a storage medium (e.g., hard disk or tape) is called **sanitization**.
- There are four categories of media sanitization:
- **Disposal**
- **Clearing**
- **Purging**
- **Destroying**
- Organizations should use information security requirements as a guide for selecting the appropriate sanitization method.

## 3. Security Activities within the SDLC
- Security activities must be integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure:
- Proper identification
- Design
- Integration
- Maintenance of applicable security controls throughout the information system's life cycle.

## 4. Awareness and Training
- The security awareness and training program is a critical component of the information security program.
- It disseminates security information necessary for the workforce, including managers, to perform their jobs effectively.
- The workforce plays a vital role in achieving information security goals, and training is a key countermeasure.
- A robust information security awareness and training program is essential for providing the workforce with the necessary information and tools to protect vital information resources.
- Personnel at all levels must understand their information security responsibilities to properly use and protect entrusted information and resources.
- Agencies that continually train their workforce in organizational security policy and role-based responsibilities will have a higher success rate in protecting information.

### 4.1 The People Factor
- People are often the weakest element in the security formula used to secure systems and networks.
- The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) mandate increased attention to awareness activities and role-based training.
- These are the only security controls that can minimize the inherent risks associated with the individuals who use, manage, operate, and maintain information systems and networks.
- Robust and enterprise-wide awareness and training programs are necessary to address these concerns.

### 4.2 Reference
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program.# Information Security Awareness and Training Program

The program provides guidelines that can help federal departments and agencies meet their information security awareness and training responsibilities defined in FISMA and in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policy. The publication identifies models for building and maintaining a comprehensive awareness and training program as part of an organization’s information security program.

NIST SP 800-50 is a companion publication to NIST SP 800-16, *Information Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role- and Performance-Based Model*. NIST SP 800-50 works at a higher strategic level and discusses how to build and maintain an information security awareness and training program; NIST SP 800-16 addresses a more tactical level and discusses the awareness-training-education continuum, role-based training, and course content considerations. The learning continuum is shown in Figure 4-1.

## 4.1 Awareness and Training Policy

All users have information security responsibilities. FISMA mandates that all users complete “awareness training,” though NIST publications call this “awareness.” FISMA also tasks agencies with identifying and training those individuals who have significant responsibilities for information security, a requirement formalized by OPM’s information security awareness and training policy promulgated in June 2004.

OPM’s policy strengthens the FISMA requirement for user exposure to “awareness training” by adding “at least annually,” and requires agencies to provide “role-specific training” in accordance with NIST guidance. Although there is no federal mandate for formal education (provided by colleges or universities) and certification of information security professionals, they are mentioned in this section since some agencies include them as part of a comprehensive training solution for federal employees.

## 4.2 Components: Awareness, Training, Education, and Certification

An agency’s information security program policy should contain a clear and distinct section devoted to agency-wide requirements for the awareness and training program. Although security awareness and training is generally referred to as “a” program, many organizations consider awareness and training to be two distinct functions, each with separate purposes, goals, and approaches. Proper implementation of these components (with consideration of options like education and professional certification) promotes professional development, which leads to a high-performance workforce.

Requirements for the security awareness and training program should be documented in the enterprise-level policy and should include:

- Definition of security roles and responsibilities;
- Development of program strategy and a program plan;
- Implementation of the program plan; and
- Maintenance of the security awareness and training program.

### 4.2.1 Awareness

Security awareness is a blended solution of activities that promote security, establish accountability, and inform the workforce of security news. Awareness seeks to focus an individual’s attention on an issue or a set of issues. Awareness is a program that continually pushes the security message to users in a variety of formats.

An awareness program includes a variety of tools, communication, outreach, and metrics development.

- **Tools**: Awareness tools are used to promote information security and inform users of threats and vulnerabilities that impact their agency and “personal” work environment by explaining the “what” but not the “how” of security, and communicating what is and what is not allowed. Awareness not only...# Information Security Policies and Procedures

## Overview
This document communicates information security policies and procedures that need to be followed, providing the foundation for any sanctions and disciplinary actions imposed for noncompliance. Awareness is used to explain the rules of behavior for using an agency’s information systems and information, establishing a level of expectation on the acceptable use of the information and information systems.

## Types of Tools
- **Events**: Such as a security awareness day.
- **Promotional Materials**
- **Briefings**: Program-specific, system-specific, or issue-specific.
- **Rules of Behavior**

## Communication
A large part of an awareness effort is communication with users, managers, executives, system owners, and others. A communications plan is needed to identify stakeholders, types of information to be disseminated, channels for disseminating information, and the frequency of information exchanges. The plan also identifies whether the communications are one-way or two-way. Activities that support communication include:
- **Assessment**: As-is/to-be models.
- **Strategic Plan**
- **Program Implementation**

## Outreach
Outreach is critical for leveraging best practices within the federal sector. It has two elements for intra- and interagency awareness:
- **Intra-agency Element**: Promotes internal awareness of information security. A web portal that provides a one-stop-shop for security information can be an effective outreach tool. Policy, frequently asked questions (FAQs), security e-newsletters, links to resources, and other useful information are easily accessible to all employees. This tool promotes a consistent and standard message.
- **Interagency Element**: Promotes sharing among agencies and is used to leverage awareness and training resources.

## Training
Information security training strives to produce relevant and needed security knowledge and skills within the workforce. Training supports competency development and helps personnel understand and learn how to perform their security role. The most important difference between training and awareness is that training seeks to teach skills that allow a person to perform a specific function, while awareness seeks to focus an individual’s attention on an issue or a set of issues.

### Role-Based Training
Role-based training provides security courses tailored to the specific needs of each group of people who have been identified as having significant responsibilities for information security in their organization. NIST SP 800-16 provides guidance for establishing role- and performance-based security training programs.

## Education
Education integrates all of the security skills and competencies of the various functional specialties into a common body of knowledge and adds a multidisciplinary study of concepts, issues, and principles (technological and social). Information security education strives to produce information security specialists and professionals who are capable of vision and proactive response. Several colleges and universities provide academic programs to support the information security needs of the public and private sectors. Many of these schools partner with the federal sector to accomplish research and development tasks to improve information security.

## Certification
In response to the growing demand for information security personnel within federal agencies, there has been a movement toward increased professional standards for federal and contracted security personnel. This "professionalization" integrates training, education, and experience with an assessment mechanism.# Information Security Awareness and Training Program

## Certification Types

The relationship among professional development elements is illustrated in Figure 4-2. It is important to note that there are distinct differences among certifications offered by various organizations. Primarily, one will encounter:

### Certificates of Completion
- Provided to individuals solely as a testament to the completion of a particular course.
- These certificates do not claim that the individual has gained knowledge and/or skills.

### Industry and Vendor Certifications
- Requires a combination of training, education, and experience.
- Validates knowledge and skills through testing.
- Provides varying degrees of assurance that an individual has a baseline level of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) regarding a predefined body of knowledge.
- Preparatory work for knowledge-based or skill-based certifications typically includes training in a prescribed body of knowledge or technical curriculum, often supplemented by on-the-job experience.

### Graduate Certificates
- Awarded by academic institutions to individuals who successfully complete all graduation requirements for a particular program.
- Generally require 18 to 21 credit hours of academic study, with at least four required courses, one or two electives, and may require a research paper, project, or case study.

## Designing, Developing, and Implementing an Awareness and Training Program

The development of an information security awareness and training program involves three major steps:

1. Designing the program (including the development of the information security awareness and training program plan).
2. Developing the awareness and training material.
3. Implementing the program.

Even a small amount of information security awareness and training can significantly improve the security posture and vigilance within an organization.

### 4.3.1 Designing an Awareness and Training Program

Awareness and training programs must be designed with the mission of the agency in mind. The program must support the business needs of the organization and be relevant to its culture and information technology architecture. The most successful programs are those that users feel are relevant to the subject matter and issues presented.

Designing an information security awareness and training program answers the question: **What is our plan for developing and implementing awareness and training opportunities that are compliant with existing directives?**

In the design step of the program:
- The agency’s awareness and training needs are identified.
- An effective agency-wide awareness and training plan is developed.
- Organizational buy-in is sought and secured.
- Priorities are established.

### 4.3.2 Developing an Awareness and Training Program

Once the awareness and training program has been designed, supporting material can be developed. Material should be developed with the following in mind:

- **What behavior do we want to reinforce?** (awareness)
- **What skill or skills do we want the audience to learn and apply?** (training and education)

In both cases, the focus should be on specific material that the participants should integrate into their jobs. Attendees will pay attention and incorporate what they learn into their daily activities.# Information Security Awareness and Training Program

## Importance of Personalization in Presentations
Individuals are more engaged in a session if they feel that the material was developed specifically for them. Presentations that feel impersonal and general may be dismissed as just another obligatory session. An effective awareness and training program must present material that is interesting, current, and relevant.

## Audience for Awareness Programs
The awareness audience should include all users within an organization, which may consist of:
- Employees
- Contractors
- Foreign or domestic guest researchers
- Other agency personnel
- Visitors and guests
- Collaborators or associates requiring access

The goal of an awareness program is to make all individuals aware of their shared information security responsibilities.

## Training vs. Awareness
The message in a training class is directed at a specific audience and should encompass all security-related information necessary for attendees to perform their jobs. Training material is typically more in-depth than that used in awareness sessions or campaigns.

## Implementing an Awareness and Training Program
An information security awareness and training program should be implemented after the following steps:
1. Conducting a needs assessment
2. Developing a strategy
3. Completing a program plan for implementation
4. Developing awareness and training material

### Explanation and Support
The program's implementation must be clearly explained to the organization to gain support and commitment of necessary resources. This includes:
- Expectations of agency management and staff support
- Expected results and benefits of the program
- Addressing funding issues, including whether costs will be covered by the chief information officer (CIO) or the information security program budget

It is essential for everyone involved in the implementation to understand their roles and responsibilities, as well as to communicate schedules and completion requirements.

### Tailoring Implementation
Once the plan has been accepted by agency management, implementation can begin. Agencies should tailor their approach to the size, organization, and complexity of their enterprise.

## Post-Implementation
An organization’s information security awareness and training program can quickly become obsolete without attention to:
- Technology advancements
- IT infrastructure changes
- Organizational changes
- Shifts in organizational mission and priorities

CIOs and senior agency information security officers (SAISOs) must be aware of this potential issue and incorporate mechanisms to ensure the program remains relevant and compliant with overall objectives. Continuous improvement should be a central theme for security awareness and training initiatives, as this is an area where "you can never do enough."

### Monitoring Compliance
Efforts supporting the post-implementation feedback loop should be developed in consideration of the security organization’s overall ongoing performance measures program.# Monitoring Compliance and Effectiveness

Once the program has been implemented, processes must be put in place to monitor compliance and effectiveness. An automated tracking system should be designed to capture key information on program activity (e.g., courses, dates, audience, costs, sources). The tracking system should capture this data at an agency level, so it can be used to provide enterprise-wide analysis and reporting regarding awareness, training, and education initiatives.

## Tracking Compliance

Tracking compliance involves assessing the status of the program as indicated by the database information and mapping it to standards established by the agency. Reports can be generated and used to identify gaps or problems. Corrective action and necessary follow-up can then be taken. This follow-up may take the form of formal reminders to management; additional awareness, training, or education offerings; and/or the establishment of a corrective plan with scheduled completion dates.

# Evaluation and Feedback

Formal evaluation and feedback mechanisms are critical components of any security awareness and training program. Continuous improvement cannot occur without a good sense of how the existing program is working. In addition, the feedback mechanism must be designed to address objectives initially established for the program. Once the baseline requirements have been solidified, a feedback strategy can be designed and implemented.

## Evaluation Mechanisms

Various evaluation and feedback mechanisms that can be used to update the awareness and training program plan include:

- Surveys
- Evaluation forms
- Independent observation
- Status reports
- Interviews
- Focus groups
- Technology shifts
- Benchmarking

A feedback strategy should incorporate elements that address quality, scope, deployment method (e.g., Web-based, onsite, offsite), level of difficulty, ease of use, duration of session, relevancy, currency, and suggestions for modification.

## Importance of Metrics

Metrics are essential to feedback and evaluation. They can be used to:

- Measure the effectiveness of the security awareness and training program
- Provide information for many of the data requests that an agency must provide with regard to compliance
- Provide an important gauge for demonstrating progress and identifying areas for improvement

# Managing Change

It is necessary to ensure that the program, as structured, continues to evolve as new technology and associated security issues emerge. Training needs will shift as new skills and capabilities become necessary to respond to new architectural and technology changes. A change in the organizational mission and/or objectives can also influence ideas on how best to design training solutions and content.

Emerging issues, such as homeland defense, will also impact the nature and extent of security awareness and training activities necessary to keep users informed and/or trained about the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. New laws and court decisions may also impact agency policy that, in turn, may affect the development and/or implementation of awareness and training material. Finally, as security policies evolve, awareness and training material should reflect these changes.

# Program Success Indicators

CIOs, program officials, and SAISOs should be primary advocates for awareness, training, education, and professionalization. Securing an organization’s information and infrastructure is a team effort, requiring the dedication of capable individuals to carry out their assigned security roles within the organization. Listed below are...# Key Indicators for Program Support and Acceptance

Some key indicators to gauge the support for, and acceptance of, the program include:

- Key stakeholder demonstrates commitment and support.
- Sufficient funding is budgeted and available to implement the agreed-upon awareness and training strategy.
- Appropriate organizational placement of senior officials with key security responsibilities (CIO, program officials, and SAISO) facilitates strategy implementation.
- Infrastructure to support broad distribution (e.g., Web, e-mail, learning management systems) and posting of security awareness and training materials is funded and implemented.
- Executive/senior-level officials deliver messages to staff regarding security (e.g., staff meetings, broadcasts to all users by agency head), champion the program, and demonstrate support for training by committing financial resources to the program.
- Metrics indicate improved security performance by the workforce (e.g., to explain a decline in security incidents or violations, indicate that the gap between existing awareness and training coverage and identified needs is shrinking, the percentage of users being exposed to awareness material is increasing, the percentage of users with significant security responsibilities being appropriately trained is increasing).
- Executives and managers do not use their status in the organization to avoid security controls that are consistently adhered to by the rank and file.
- Level of attendance at security forums/briefings/training is consistently high.
- Recognition of security contributions (e.g., awards, contests) is a standard practice within an agency.
- Individuals playing key roles in managing/coordinating the security program demonstrate commitment to the program and motivation to promote the program.

# Chapter 5: Capital Planning and Investment Control

Increased competition for limited federal budgets and resources requires that agencies allocate available funding toward their highest-priority information security investments to afford the agency and its systems and data the appropriate degree of security for their needs. This goal can be achieved through a formal enterprise capital planning and investment control (CPIC) process designed to facilitate and control the expenditure of agency funds. The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and other existing federal regulations charge federal agencies with integrating information security activities and the capital planning and investment control process. The practices discussed in this chapter are designed to help security practitioners and managers identify funding needs to secure systems and provide strategies for obtaining the necessary funding.

## 5.1 Legislative Overview

Implementation of information security within the federal government is guided by a combination of legislation, rules and regulations, and agency-specific policies. FISMA is the overarching information security legislation for federal information systems. Signed into law in 2002, FISMA:

- Charges the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and NIST to develop security standards and identify tolerable security risk levels.
- Makes NIST standards compulsory for all agencies; FISMA eliminated an agency’s ability to obtain waivers on NIST standards (Federal Information Processing Standard [FIPS]).
- Charges agencies to integrate information security into CPIC.
- NIST SP 800-53 identifies a set of minimum security controls applicable to...# Information Systems and Capital Planning

## Overview of FIPS 199 Categorization
Information systems are categorized based on FIPS 199 as low, moderate, or high.

## OMB Circular A-11
- OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies to complete Exhibit 300s and an Exhibit 53.
- The Exhibit 300 reflects an investment’s plan for capital asset management.
- The Exhibit 300 serves as an input to the Exhibit 53, which provides the total information technology (IT) and information security spending for the year.

## FISMA Report
- The FISMA Report is an annual report to OMB detailing the agency’s security posture and any areas of weakness.

## Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)
- The POA&M documents each agency security weakness, associated corrective action, and the corrective action cost.
- The corrective action and cost information contained in the POA&M serve as inputs to the Exhibit 300s and are then rolled into the Exhibit 53.
- Exhibit 300s and Exhibit 53 are part of the agency’s budget submission to OMB and provide an overview of an agency’s IT portfolio.

## GAO Investment Life-Cycle Model
To facilitate effective implementation of OMB capital planning and NIST security requirements, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) offers a Select-Control-Evaluate investment life-cycle model as a best practices approach to investment management. While not compulsory, the framework articulates key activities for managing IT investments throughout the life cycle. The three phases ensure that investment management practices, including security, are disciplined and thorough throughout each phase of the investment life cycle.

### Select Phase
- The Select phase involves assessing and prioritizing current and proposed IT projects based on mission needs and improvement priorities.
- Activities include:
- Screening new projects
- Analyzing and ranking all projects based on benefit, cost, and risk criteria
- Selecting a portfolio of projects
- Establishing project review schedules

### Control Phase
- The Control phase involves monitoring the investment during its operational phase to determine whether it is within the cost and schedule milestones established at the beginning of the investment life cycle.
- Typical processes include:
- Using a set of performance measures to monitor developmental progress for each IT project
- Enabling early problem identification and resolution

### Evaluate Phase
- The Evaluate phase determines the efficacy of the investment, answering the question, “Did the investment achieve the desired results and performance goals identified during the Select phase?”

## Relationship Between Security Drivers and Investment Lifecycle
- The relationship between security drivers in the GAO Select-Control-Evaluate investment lifecycle and the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is illustrated in Figure 5-1.
- During the Select phase, security drivers include assessment activities to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- In the Control phase, investments are monitored through security metrics to ensure that security controls are operational and compliant.
- In the Evaluate phase, security drivers include self-assessment activities to ensure compliance and media sanitization efforts following removal from operation and prior to disposition.

## Integrating Information Security into the CPIC Process
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) provides guidance on integrating information security into the Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process.# 800-65: Integrating IT Security into the Capital Planning and Investment Control Process

## Overview
The document outlines a seven-step process for prioritizing security activities and corrective actions, as illustrated in Figure 5-2.

## Seven-Step Process

1. **Identify the Baseline**:
- Use information security metrics or other available data to baseline the current security posture.

2. **Identify Prioritization Requirements**:
- Evaluate security posture against legislative and chief information officer (CIO)-articulated requirements and agency mission.

3. **Conduct Enterprise-Level Prioritization**:
- Prioritize potential enterprise-level information security investments against the mission and the financial impact of implementing appropriate security controls.

4. **Conduct System-Level Prioritization**:
- Prioritize potential system-level corrective actions against system category and corrective action impact.

5. **Develop Supporting Materials**:
- For enterprise-level investments, develop a concept paper, business case analysis, and Exhibit 300. For system-level investments, adjust Exhibit 300 to request additional funding to mitigate prioritized weaknesses.

6. **Implement Investment Review Board (IRB) and Portfolio Management**:
- Prioritize agency-wide business cases against requirements and CIO priorities and determine the investment portfolio.

7. **Submit Exhibit 300s, Exhibit 53, and Conduct Program Management**:
- Ensure approved 300s become part of the agency’s Exhibit 53; ensure investments are managed through their life cycle.

## Integration of Information Security into the CPIC Process
The following sections provide an overview of the integration of information security into the Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process to ensure that corrective actions identified in the annual FISMA reporting process through Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) are incorporated into the CPIC process to deliver maximum security in a cost-effective manner.

## 5.3 Capital Planning and Investment Control Roles and Responsibilities
Integrating information security into the CPIC process requires input and collaboration across operating units and lines of business throughout the life cycle of technology investments.

### Hierarchical Approach
Figure 5-3 depicts a hierarchical approach to the CPIC process in which investment decisions are made at both the enterprise and operating-unit levels.

While specific practices for investment management can differ at the operating-unit level due to varying mission scopes, the process generally mirrors the process at the departmental level.

The CIO formulates and articulates information security priorities to the organization to be considered within the context of all agency investments. Priorities may be based on agency mission and executive branch guidance such as the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), OMB guidance, or other external/internal priorities.

### Examples of Security Priorities
Examples of security priorities include certifying and accrediting all systems or implementing public key infrastructure (PKI) throughout the enterprise. It is important to note that OMB/executive branch guidance or laws should be ranked highest among these priorities.

Once operating units finalize their IT portfolios and budget requests for the...# Integration of Information Security into the CPIC Process

## Overview
In the budget year, requests are forwarded to agency-level decision makers. At the agency level, several committees evaluate IT portfolios from the operating units, culminating in a review by the Investment Review Board (IRB). The IRB decides on an agency-level IT portfolio and forwards recommendations to the agency head for review. Once the agency-level IT portfolio is approved by the agency head, the necessary Exhibit 300s and Exhibit 53 are forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for funding consideration.

## Stakeholder Involvement
Many different stakeholders, including those from information security, capital planning, and executive leadership areas, play key roles in integrating information security into the Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process. The ultimate goal is to form a well-balanced IT portfolio. Involvement at both the enterprise and operating-unit levels throughout the process allows agencies to ensure that CPIC and information security goals and objectives are met.

### Roles of Stakeholders
Figure 5-4 identifies typical leading, supporting, or approving roles for each stakeholder as they apply to the integration of security into the CPIC process phases.

## 5.4 Identify Baseline
The first step in integrating information security and the CPIC process is to assess the security baseline. The security baseline provides a snapshot of the agency’s compliance with baseline security requirements (BLSRs) and is instrumental in identifying information security strengths and weaknesses.

### Importance of Security Baseline
The result of a security baseline analysis enables agency executives to evaluate their information security posture and identify areas for improvement. Agencies can identify their baselines for both enterprise-level and system-level investments:

- **System-level investments**: Security investments designed to strengthen a discrete system’s security posture, such as strengthening password controls or testing a contingency plan for a particular system.
- **Enterprise-level investments**: Security investments that are ubiquitous across the agency and will improve the overall agency’s security posture, such as the acquisition of an enterprise-wide firewall or intrusion detection system (IDS).

### Guidance on Security Metrics
NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides guidance on developing and implementing an information security metrics program. Metrics can provide baseline compliance percentages that indicate the existence of adequate security controls, highlight current weaknesses, and identify gaps between actual and desired implementation status of information security controls.

The goal of the security baseline establishment exercise is to provide agency officials with an understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities that exist within the agency’s security controls and to help identify investments that are required to mitigate weaknesses. The resulting vulnerabilities and weaknesses then serve as inputs into the next step of the CPIC process: identifying prioritization criteria.

## 5.5 Identify Prioritization Criteria
Available funding does not always allow all security needs identified in the baseline assessment to be addressed immediately. Therefore, requirements must be prioritized to address the most pressing security investment needs first.

### Variability of Prioritization Criteria
Specific prioritization criteria will vary from agency to agency depending on specific agency missions, goals, and applicable legislation and regulations. Examples of information security priorities include:

- [Further examples to be provided]# Compliance and Security Program Overview

## Statutory Requirements
- Complying with statutory requirements in Clinger-Cohen Act, FISMA, and OMB Circular A-130 guidance.
- Implementing a risk-based security program (FISMA, Executive Orders, and supporting NIST standards and guidance); for example, implementing the security controls outlined in NIST SP 800-53.
- Safeguarding national and agency mission-critical assets (Homeland Security Presidential Directives).
- Improving information security program status.
- Completing a security certification and accreditation of all systems in accordance with NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.

## Taxonomies for Prioritization
A variety of taxonomies can be used to organize prioritization criteria, including:
- FIPS 200 security control families or other agency-specific categories.

## System- and Enterprise-Level Prioritization
Once agency management and stakeholders agree on the prioritization of investments, the agency can begin the prioritizing process by rank-ordering requirements against the prioritization criteria. The objective of this activity is to fund first the most critical security investment. The next layer of funding should then be applied to the next critical security investment and so forth, until the security budget is entirely expended, or priorities met, whichever comes first.

Before conducting corrective action prioritization, the agency should allocate the funding necessary to mitigate significant deficiencies and other needs that obviously require attention. These initiatives should then be removed from the prioritization process to avoid duplication of effort.

### Levels of Prioritization
After identifying the security baseline and prioritization criteria, an agency can prioritize corrective actions at two levels:

1. **System-level prioritization**: Prioritize corrective actions to address system-level security weaknesses and vulnerabilities found during the baseline assessment against the predefined prioritization criteria. This prioritization is performed at the operating unit level by system owners and program managers.

2. **Enterprise-level prioritization**: Prioritize enterprise-wide security corrective actions identified during the baseline assessment based on predefined prioritization criteria. This prioritization is performed at the enterprise level by agency information security stakeholders.

## Methodology and Data Sources
The prioritization methodology relies primarily on existing data sources and inputs. Specific data inputs for the two types of prioritization are highlighted in Table 5-1.

### Key Metrics
- **Compliance gap**: The difference between the desired and actual compliance with the security requirements. For example, if an information system has completed 80 percent of security certification and accreditation activities, that investment would have a security certification and accreditation compliance gap of 20 percent. (The actual compliance of 80 percent is subtracted from the desired compliance of 100 percent to yield a 20 percent compliance gap.) The smaller the compliance gap, the more compliant the system or enterprise control. For key information security activities, this information is part of the FISMA report.

- **Corrective action impact**: The ratio of compliance gap to corrective action cost. The corrective action impact is calculated by dividing the compliance gap percentage by the cost to implement the corresponding corrective action(s). This ratio provides a proportion of result to cost.# Corrective Action Prioritization Process

The prioritization process for corrective actions involves several key steps to ensure that the most impactful actions are taken. The following outlines the steps and considerations involved in this process.

## Steps to Complete the Prioritization Process

1. **Rank-order prioritized corrective action categories** according to selected prioritization criteria in order of importance to the agency.
2. **Rank-order agency systems** according to system category.
3. **Calculate the security compliance gaps** at the enterprise and investment levels.
4. **Calculate the corrective action impact** at the enterprise and investment levels.

Both enterprise- and system-level prioritization should be performed and then overlapped to ensure that appropriate agency priorities receive funding commensurate with their risk levels.

## Tools for Prioritization

Prioritization may be facilitated using a spreadsheet or a more sophisticated automation tool. Visualization of the prioritization may be used to facilitate the decision-making process.

### Example Visualization

Figure 5-6 demonstrates an example of a corrective action prioritization visualization approach using notional data.

- From a system-level perspective, Figure 5-6 plots system category along the vertical axis and corrective action impact along the horizontal axis. The notional agency systems are denoted as the small letters at the top of each quadrant. In this example, systems ‘N’ and ‘F’ were found to have category rankings of ‘high’ and corrective action impacts of ‘great.’

- Drawn from the perspective of the enterprise, Figure 5-6 plots agency-determined security controls importance along the vertical axis and corrective action impact along the horizontal axis. The numbers (1-17) represent the seventeen NIST SP 800-53 security control areas used for this example. Security control area 12 ranked ‘high’ in importance but had a ‘basic’ corrective action impact.

### Cost Analysis

The dollar figures in Figure 5-6 represent the total cost to implement all corrective actions within that cell. For example, looking at cell HG, it would cost the agency $85,961 to implement corrective actions for systems ‘N’ and ‘F’ and topic area ‘4.’

After plotting all of its systems, the agency should perform executive validation of the placement of the various systems to ensure that stakeholders’ priorities are met.

## Stakeholder Review

Agency information security stakeholders should review the prioritization results to ensure that the prioritization is appropriate and given the opportunity to reprioritize their inputs if the results of the process are found to be unsatisfactory.

Assuming the agency stakeholders agree that all prioritized corrective actions are appropriate, as displayed in Figure 5-6, the analysis can proceed accordingly.

### Implementation Strategy

As indicated by the axes, the implementation of corrective actions should begin with cell HG and proceed diagonally down to cell LB to ensure that the agency implements the most cost-effective, high-impact corrective actions.

## Budget Consideration

To continue with the example, assume the notional agency has a $2,000,000 budget to implement information security corrective actions. As Figure 5-6 demonstrates, adding the three highest priority cells together (HG, HA, and MG) brings a total of $891,775, which is nearly half of the corrective action budget. The agency would then move to the next tier of prioritization, or cells HB, MA, and so on.# Current Page Overview

## Totaling and Budget Allocation
Totaling these cells yields a total of **$503,350**, which combined with the previous total from HG, HA, and MG, yields a running total of **$1,395,125**. With **$604,875** remaining in the corrective action budget, the agency would proceed with prioritization into cells MB and LA. Totaling those two cells yields **$2,619,505**.

Clearly, this total exceeds the remaining corrective action budget, so stakeholders will have to decide on how to allocate the remaining dollars. Should stakeholders determine that the corrective action impact order (G, A, B) is the driving factor, the corrective actions in cell LA will be implemented. If the stakeholders determine that the system and security control category (H, M, L) is the driving factor, the corrective actions from cell MB will be implemented until the remaining **$604,875** is expended.

## 5.7 Develop Supporting Materials
Once prioritizing against requirements is completed, operating units are poised to select their investments for the budget year and begin the process of requesting funding from OMB for the next year to implement the corrective actions and security controls.

The **Exhibit 300** is the capture mechanism for all of the analyses and activities required for full internal review (e.g., IRB, CIO). More importantly, Exhibit 300 is the document that OMB uses to assess investments and ultimately make funding decisions, and therefore should be leveraged by agencies to clearly demonstrate the need for life cycle and annual funding requests. The Exhibit 300 is completed for new IT investments and is resubmitted annually for mixed life-cycle and steady-state investments. Operating units should evaluate their prioritized corrective actions and security controls identified during the prioritization process and determine whether the outputs need to be incorporated into an existing investment’s Exhibit 300 or whether they will need to create an independent Exhibit 300 for a new investment.

## 5.8 IRB and Portfolio Management
The **IRB** reviews and selects investments for the agency portfolio based on the Exhibit 300s forwarded by the operating units. Like the prioritization that occurs at the operating-unit level, the IRB typically uses strategic selection criteria to rank-order the investment pool and usually makes decisions based on agency mission and goals, not just on cost.

While security is not the typical driving force behind portfolio management, it is a critical element in the investment strategy because it serves as a qualifier for receiving funding and as a business enabler for those functions which support the agency’s mission. After prioritizing and approving select Exhibit 300s, the IRB creates an investment portfolio request for review by OMB.

## 5.9 Exhibits 53 and 300 and Program Management
Following selection into the agency’s IT portfolio, the agency aggregates Exhibit 300s into the **Exhibit 53**. The Exhibit 53 provides an overview of the agency’s entire IT portfolio by listing every IT investment, life cycle, and budget-year cost.# Information on IT Investments and Interconnecting Systems

## IT Investments

In addition to containing all investments with Exhibit 300s, the Exhibit 53 also contains other IT investments that do not have Exhibit 300s (e.g., legacy systems with costs below agency thresholds). OMB evaluates an agency’s Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300s and determines appropriate funding amounts for the budget year based on the justification articulated in the Exhibit 300s. Agencies then receive their budget year funding and must implement or maintain their investments throughout the year by applying allocated funding.

## Chapter 6: Interconnecting Systems

A system interconnection is defined as the direct connection of two or more information systems for sharing data and other information resources. Organizations choose to interconnect their information systems for a variety of reasons based on their organizational needs. For example, they may interconnect information systems to exchange data, collaborate on joint projects, or securely store data and backup files.

### Definition of Interconnection

An interconnection is a direct connection between one organization’s system with another system of the same or different organization through a mechanism by which they are joined (the “pipe” through which data is made available, exchanged, or passed one way only). The “pipe” may be a dedicated line that is owned by one of the organizations or is leased from a third party (e.g., Integrated Services Digital Network [ISDN], T1 or T3 line). Alternately, the systems may be connected over a public network (e.g., Internet) using a virtual private network (VPN).

### Examples of Interconnections

- System A is connected to System B over a subscriber line leased by System A or System B.
- System A is segmented such that System A1 is integrated with System A but is under different management control: Authorizing Official (AO).
- System B provides data transport services between System A and System C. Here, System B is engaged in two interconnections with Systems A and C.

### Levels of System Interconnection

Levels of system interconnection may vary. For example, some organizations may choose to establish a limited interconnection, whereby users are restricted to a single application or file location with rules governing access. Other organizations may establish a broader interconnection, enabling users to access multiple applications or databases. Still, other organizations may establish an interconnection that permits full transparency and access across their respective enterprises.

### Risks of Interconnecting Information Systems

Interconnecting information systems can expose the participating organizations to risk. If the interconnection is not properly designed, security failures could compromise the connected systems and their data. Similarly, if one of the connected systems is compromised, the interconnection could be used as a conduit to compromise the other system and its data.

### Federal Policy on Interconnection Security

Federal policy requires that federal agencies establish interconnection security agreements. Specifically, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, requires that agencies obtain written management authority before connecting their information systems to other systems, based on a mutually acceptable level of risk. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-47, Security Guide for Interconnecting Information Technology Systems, provides detailed guidance on interconnecting information systems.# 6.1 Managing System Interconnections

All federal agencies must explicitly address the subject of interconnecting information systems by establishing formal agreements that specify the technical and security requirements of the interconnection, define the responsibilities of the participating organizations, and specify the rules governing these interconnections.

In addition to an A-130, Appendix III, requirement to obtain written management authority before interconnecting information systems, OMB recommends that agencies use NIST SP 800-47 to ensure compliance for connections to non-agency systems.

When organizations are properly managing interconnected systems, the added benefits include greater efficiency, centralized access to data, and greater functionality. The security controls of each of the interconnected systems should be evaluated and meet each other’s requirements for implementing security controls that are appropriate for the particular interconnection. Both organizations should specify their requirements regarding the security controls to be implemented in accordance with NIST FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, and NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.

Each system involved in interconnection should be governed by an organization’s AO who has the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating a system at an acceptable level of risk. NIST SP 800-53 specifically defines an information systems connections control (specified in Table 6-1) that organizations are required to implement based on an information system’s security categorization. Since these categorizations and guidance apply to individual systems, agencies should carefully weigh the associated risks when systems differing in configuration or security controls are interconnected.

It is critical that both organizations maintain clear lines of communication to:

- Ensure that the interconnection is properly maintained and that security controls remain effective;
- Facilitate effective change management activities by making it easy for both sides to notify each other about planned system changes that could affect the interconnection; and
- Enable prompt notification by both sides of security incidents and system disruptions and facilitate coordinated response, if necessary.

Identifying and implementing security controls is vital in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the connected systems and the data that is transferred between the systems. If security controls are not in place or if they are configured improperly, the process of establishing the interconnection could expose the information systems to unauthorized access. Agencies should select applicable controls from NIST SP 800-53, based on the security categorization of the systems involved in the interconnection from FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, and NIST SP 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories. The security controls should be appropriately selected in consideration of the systems that will be connected and the environment in which the interconnection will operate.

One or both organizations should review the security controls for the interconnection at least annually or whenever a significant change occurs to either system or the operational environment. This review is intended to ensure that all controls are operating properly and still provide the requisite degree of system security.# Data Security

## 6.2 Life-Cycle Management Approach

NIST SP 800-47 details a four-phase "life-cycle management" approach for interconnecting information systems that emphasizes proper attention to information security:

- **Phase 1:** Planning the Interconnection
- **Phase 2:** Establishing the Interconnection
- **Phase 3:** Maintaining the Interconnection
- **Phase 4:** Disconnecting the Interconnection

### 6.2.1 Phase 1: Planning the Interconnection

The process of connecting two or more information systems begins with a planning phase, where the participating organizations perform preliminary activities and examine all relevant technical, security, and administrative issues. The planning phase ensures that the interconnection will operate as efficiently and securely as possible. Six steps are recommended for planning a system interconnection. A more detailed process is described in the following paragraphs.

#### Step 1: Establish a Joint Planning Team

The organizations should consider establishing a joint planning team composed of appropriate management and technical staff that includes program managers, system security officers, system administrators, network administrators, and system architects. The typical joint planning team is responsible for coordinating all aspects of the planning process and ensuring that it has both clear direction and sufficient resources. It also must have the commitment and support of the system and data owners, and other senior managers.

#### Step 2: Define the Business Case

Both organizations should work together to define the purpose of the interconnection, determine how it will support their mission requirements, and identify potential costs and risks. Defining the business case will establish the basis of the interconnection and facilitate the planning process. Factors that should be considered are estimated costs (e.g., staffing, equipment, facilities), expected benefits (e.g., improved efficiency), and potential risks (e.g., technical, legal, and financial).

#### Step 3: Perform Certification and Accreditation

Establishing an interconnection may represent a significant change to the connected systems. Before proceeding further, each organization should consider recertification and reaccreditation of its respective system(s) to verify that security protections remain acceptable. A full security certification and accreditation might not be necessary, however, if the system continues to operate within an acceptable level of risk; in that case, an abbreviated certification and accreditation would suffice.

#### Step 4: Determine Interconnection Requirements

The joint planning team should identify and examine all relevant technical, security, and administrative requirements surrounding the proposed interconnection.

#### Step 5: Document Interconnection Agreement

The interconnection security agreement (ISA) is a security document that...# System Interconnection Agreement (ISA) and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU/MOA)

## Overview
The System Interconnection Agreement (ISA) specifies the technical and security requirements for establishing, operating, and maintaining the interconnection. It also supports the memorandum of understanding/memorandum of agreement (MOU/MOA) between the organizations.

## Purpose of the ISA
The ISA documents the following:
- Requirements for connecting the information systems.
- Security controls that will be used to protect the systems and data.
- A topological drawing of the interconnection.
- A signature line for agreement.

## Joint Planning Team Responsibilities
The joint planning team should document an agreement governing the interconnection and the terms under which the organizations will abide. This agreement should be based on the team’s review of all relevant technical, security, and administrative requirements identified and examined in Step 4.

## MOU/MOA Details
The MOU/MOA documents the terms and conditions for sharing data and information resources. It includes:
- Definition of the purpose of the interconnection.
- Identification of relevant authorities.
- Specification of the responsibilities of each organization.
- Definition of the apportionment of costs.
- Identification of the timeline for terminating or reauthorizing the interconnection.

To be enforceable, the MOU/MOA must be signed by an organization official, typically the authorizing official (AO). Additionally, because the ISA and the MOU/MOA may contain sensitive information, the original document and any copies should be protected against unauthorized disclosure, modification, damage, or destruction.

## Step 6: Approve or Reject System Interconnection
The joint planning team should submit the ISA and the MOU/MOA to the AO of each organization, requesting approval for the interconnection. Upon receipt, the AOs should review the ISA, the MOU/MOA, and any other relevant documentation or activities.

### Combining ISAs and MOU/MOAs
Organizations may combine ISAs and MOU/MOAs to simplify their management processes and reduce paperwork if these two documents fall within the purview of the same AO. When combining ISAs and MOU/MOAs, organizations must ensure that the contents and the intent of these two documents remain unaltered.

### AO Decision Options
Based on the review, the AOs should decide on one of the following:
- Approve the interconnection.
- Grant interim approval.
- Reject the interconnection.

## Phase 2: Establishing the Interconnection
After the system interconnection is planned and approved, it can be implemented. The recommended steps for establishing the system interconnection are provided in Figure 6-3.

### Step 1: Develop an Implementation Plan
To ensure that the information systems are connected properly and securely, the joint planning team should develop a system interconnection implementation plan. At a minimum, the implementation plan should:
- Describe the information systems that will be connected.
- Identify the sensitivity or classification level of data that will be made available, exchanged, or passed one way across the interconnection.
- Identify personnel who will establish and maintain the interconnection and specify their responsibilities.
- Identify implementation tasks and procedures.
- Identify and describe security controls that will be used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the connected systems and data.
- Provide test procedures and measurement criteria to ensure that the interconnection operates properly and securely.
- Specify training requirements for users, including a training schedule.
- Cite or include all relevant documentation, such as system security plans.# Interconnection Management

## 1. Design Specifications and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

### Step 2: Execute the Implementation Plan
After the implementation plan is developed, it should be reviewed and approved by senior members of the planning team and then executed. A list of recommended tasks for establishing an interconnection includes:

- Implement or configure security controls
- Install or configure hardware and software
- Integrate applications
- Conduct operational and security assessments
- Conduct security training and awareness
- Update system security plans
- Perform recertification and reaccreditation

Procedures associated with each task should be described in the implementation plan.

### Step 3: Activate the Interconnection
Both parties should activate the interconnection following the implementation plan execution. Each agency should closely and frequently examine the system’s audit logs and the types of assistance requested by the system’s users during this time to ensure that it operates properly and securely. Lastly, the appropriate agency should promptly document and address any security weaknesses or problems.

## 2. Phase 3: Maintaining the Interconnection
After the interconnection is established, the participating organizations must actively maintain it to ensure that it operates properly and securely. The following activities are recommended for maintaining the interconnection:

- Maintain the equipment
- Manage user profiles
- Conduct security reviews
- Analyze audit logs
- Report and respond to security incidents
- Coordinate contingency planning activities
- Perform change management
- Maintain system security plans

## 3. Phase 4: Disconnecting the Interconnection
Phase-out may either be planned or it may be an emergency. Organizations may wish to restore some of the disconnections but not others.

## 4. Terminating Interconnection
An organization might have a variety of reasons to terminate an interconnection, for instance, changed business needs, cost considerations, or changes in system configuration. The decision to terminate the interconnection should be made by the system owner with the advice of appropriate management and technical staff.

Before terminating the interconnection, the initiating party should provide written notice to the receiving party. In turn, the receiving party should acknowledge receipt of the notification. The notification should describe the reason(s) for the disconnection, provide the proposed timeline for the disconnection, and identify technical and management staff that will conduct the disconnection.

The schedule for terminating the interconnection should permit a reasonable time period for internal business planning so both sides can make appropriate arrangements. In addition, staff from both organizations should coordinate to determine the logistics of the disconnection and the disposition of shared data, including purging and overwriting sensitive data. The disconnection should be conducted when the impact on users is minimal. Following the disconnection, each organization should update its system security plan and related documents.

### 4.1 Emergency Disconnection
If one or both organizations detect an attack, intrusion attempt, or other contingency that exploits or jeopardizes the connected systems or their data, it might be necessary to abruptly terminate the interconnection without providing prior notice.# Written Notice and Emergency Disconnection Procedures

This extraordinary measure should be taken only in extreme circumstances and only after consultation with appropriate technical staff and senior management.

## Decision Making for Emergency Disconnection

The decision to make the emergency disconnection should be made by the system owner (or a designated staff member) and implemented by technical staff. The system owner or designee should immediately notify the other party verbally and receive confirmation of the notification. Both parties should work together to isolate and investigate the incident, in accordance with incident response procedures.

### Notification to Law Enforcement

If necessary, law enforcement authorities should be notified, and evidence should be preserved. The initiating party should provide a written notification to the other party in a timely manner (e.g., within five days). The notification should describe the nature of the incident, explain why and how the interconnection was terminated, and identify actions taken to isolate and investigate the incident. The notification should also specify when and under what conditions the interconnection may be restored, if appropriate.

## Restoration of Interconnection

Both organizations may choose to restore the system interconnection after it has been terminated. The decision to restore the interconnection should be based on the cause and duration of the disconnection. For example, if the interconnection was terminated because of an attack, intrusion, or other contingency, both parties should implement appropriate countermeasures to prevent a recurrence of the problem. If necessary, they also should modify the ISA and MOU/MOA to address issues requiring attention.

### Risk Assessment

Alternately, if the interconnection has been terminated for more than 90 days, each party should perform a risk assessment on its respective system and reexamine all relevant planning and implementation requirements, including developing a new ISA and MOU/MOA.

# Chapter 7: Performance Measures

A performance measures program provides numerous organizational and financial benefits to federal agencies. Agencies can develop information security metrics that measure the effectiveness of their security program and provide data to be analyzed and used by program managers and system owners to isolate problems, justify investment requests, and target funds specifically to the areas in need of improvement. By using metrics to target security investments, agencies can get the best value from available resources.

## Components of an Effective Security Metrics Program

The typical information performance management program consists of four interdependent components:

1. **Senior Management Support**: Strong senior management support establishes a focus on security within the highest levels of the organization. Without a solid foundation (e.g., proactive support of those persons in positions that control information resources), the effectiveness of the security metrics program can fail when pressured by politics and budget limitations.

2. **Security Policies and Procedures**:

3. **Quantifiable Performance Metrics**:

4. **Analyses**:

----

*Note: The last two components of the security metrics program are not detailed in the provided text.*# Practical Security Policies and Procedures

## Introduction
Practical security policies and procedures are essential for enforcing compliance. Metrics are not easily obtainable in the absence of these policies and procedures.

## Developing Quantifiable Performance Metrics
The third component involves developing and establishing quantifiable performance metrics designed to capture and provide meaningful performance data. To ensure the data is meaningful, quantifiable security metrics must be:

- Based on information security performance goals and objectives
- Easily obtainable
- Repeatable
- Relevant
- Useful
- Measurable

## Importance of Periodic Analysis
The security metrics program must emphasize consistent, periodic analysis of the metrics data. The results of this analysis are used to:

- Apply lessons learned
- Improve the effectiveness of existing security controls
- Plan future controls to meet new security requirements as they arise

Accurate data collection must be a priority for stakeholders and users to ensure that the collected data is meaningful for the management and improvement of the overall security program.

## Legal Framework
A number of existing laws, rules, and regulations cite information technology (IT) performance measurement in general and information security performance measurement in particular as requirements. These laws include:

- Clinger-Cohen Act
- Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)
- Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA)
- Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

## NIST Guidance
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-55, *Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems*, provides guidance on how an organization can use metrics to identify the adequacy of in-place security controls, policies, and procedures. It offers an approach to help management decide where to invest in additional security protection resources or how to identify and evaluate nonproductive controls.

### Metrics Development and Implementation
The guide explains the metrics development and implementation process and how it can be used to justify security control investments. The results of an effective metrics program can provide useful data for directing the allocation of information security resources and simplify the preparation of performance-related reports.

## Challenges in Budgeting
Fiscal constraints and market conditions compel government and industry to operate on reduced budgets. In such an environment, justifying broad investments in the information security infrastructure becomes challenging. Historically, arguments for investing in specific areas of information security lack detail and specificity and fail to adequately mitigate specific system risks.

### Role of Information Security Metrics
Information security metrics can facilitate the capital planning and investment control (CPIC) process by providing quantifiable information for business case development. They can also assist in determining the effectiveness of implemented information security processes, procedures, and controls by relating the results of information security activities (e.g., incident data, revenue lost to cyber attacks) to the respective requirements and information security investments.

## Compliance Demonstration
Departments and agencies can demonstrate compliance with applicable laws, such as FISMA, rules, and regulations by implementing and maintaining an information security metrics program as described in this handbook. Information security metrics will assist in satisfying the annual FISMA reporting requirement by providing an infrastructure for organized data collection, analysis, and reporting.# Information Security Metrics

Information security metrics can also be used as input into the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Inspector General (IG) audits.

## 7.1 Metric Types

Metrics are tools that support decision making. Like experience, external mandates, and strategies, metrics are one element of a manager’s toolkit for making and substantiating decisions. Metrics are used to answer three basic questions:

- **Am I implementing the tasks for which I am responsible?**
Consider the example of a program manager with responsibility for 250 information systems. Among other things, that manager is responsible for the security certification and accreditation of those systems. A commonly used implementation metric for security certification and accreditation is the percentage of systems accredited.

- **How efficiently or effectively am I accomplishing those tasks?**
Such metrics often answer more complex questions after an activity is fully implemented. For example, federal law requires that security certification and accreditation take place following a major system change. One might measure the efficiency of a security certification and accreditation program by determining the time lag between each major system change and that system’s renewed accreditation. Or one might measure the effectiveness of a security certification and accreditation program by determining the number of accredited systems whose certification process included the creation of a system security plan.

- **What impact are those tasks having on the mission?**
Activities are initially selected with the belief that they will contribute to the mission. After an activity is shown to be fully implemented, managers must validate that the activity is delivering the expected benefit. These metrics are the most difficult to generate. A security certification and accreditation process may prove to have an impact by showing that fewer interruptions or losses of data due to security incidents are experienced among correctly accredited systems than among incorrectly accredited or non-accredited systems.

## 7.2 Metrics Development and Implementation Approach

Two processes guide the establishment and operation of an information security metrics program: metrics development and metrics implementation. The metrics development process establishes the initial set of metrics and selection of the metrics subset appropriate for an organization at a given time. The metrics program implementation process operates a metrics program that is iterative by nature and ensures that appropriate aspects of information security are measured for a specific time period.

## 7.3 Metrics Development Process

Figure 7-1 illustrates the place of information security metrics within a larger organizational context and demonstrates that information security metrics can be used to progressively measure implementation, efficiency, effectiveness, and the business impact of information security activities within organizations or for specific systems.

The information security metrics development process consists of two major activities:

1. Identifying and defining the current information security program.
2. Developing and selecting specific metrics to measure implementation, efficiency, effectiveness, and the impact of the security controls.

The process steps do not need to be sequential. Rather, the process illustrated in Figure 7-1 provides a framework for thinking about metrics and aids in identifying metrics to be developed for each system. The type of metric depends on where the system is within its life cycle and on the maturity of the information system security program. This framework facilitates tailoring metrics to a specific organization.# Information Security Metrics

## Stakeholder Groups
The different stakeholder groups present within each organization play a crucial role in the development and implementation of information security metrics.

## Phases of Metric Development
Phases 5, 6, and 7, depicted in Figure 7-1, involve developing metrics that measure:
- Process implementation
- Effectiveness and efficiency
- Mission impact

## Focus of Metrics
The specific aspect of information security that metrics will focus on at any given point will depend on the maturity of the information security program.

### Implementation Evidence
Implementation evidence, required to prove higher levels of effectiveness, will change from:
1. Establishing the existence of policy and procedures
2. Quantifying the implementation of these policies and procedures
3. Quantifying the results of the implementation of policies and procedures
4. Identifying the impact of implementation on the organization’s mission

## Prioritizing Metrics
Based on existing policies and procedures, the universe of possible metrics can be prohibitively large. Therefore, agencies should prioritize metrics to ensure that the final set selected for initial implementation has the following attributes:
- **Facilitates improvement** of high-priority security control implementation. High priority may be defined by:
- The latest GAO or IG reports
- Results of a risk assessment
- An internal organizational goal
- **Uses data** that can realistically be obtained from existing processes and data repositories
- **Measures processes** that already exist and are relatively stable. Measuring nonexistent or unstable processes will not provide meaningful information about security performance and will therefore not be useful for targeting specific aspects of performance. However, attempting such measurement may not be entirely useless, as it will certainly produce poor results and will therefore identify an area that needs improvement.

## Data Sources for Metrics
Metrics can be derived from existing data sources, including:
- Security certification and accreditation
- Security assessments
- Plan of action and milestones (POA&M)
- Incident statistics
- Agency-initiated or independent reviews

Agencies may decide to use a weighting scale to differentiate the importance of selected metrics and to ensure that the results accurately reflect existing security program priorities. This process would involve assigning values to each metric based on its importance in the context of the overall security program.

### Metrics Weighting
Metrics weighting should be based on:
- Overall risk mitigation goals
- Higher criticality of department-level initiatives versus smaller-scale initiatives
- Integration of information security into the departmental capital planning process

## Phased Approach to Metrics
A phased approach may be required to identify short-, mid-, and long-term metrics, where the implementation time frame depends on a combination of:
- System-level effectiveness
- Metric priority
- Data availability
- Process stability

## Documentation of Metrics
Once applicable metrics that contain the qualities described above are identified, they will need to be documented with supporting detail, including:
- Frequency of data collection
- Data source
- Formula for calculation
- Implementation evidence for measured activity
- A guide for metric data interpretation

Other information about each metric can be defined based on an organization’s processing and business requirements.

## Metrics Program Implementation
Information security metrics should be used for monitoring information security control performance and initiating performance improvement actions.# Iterative Process for Information Security Metrics Program

The iterative process consists of six phases, depicted in Figure 7-2.

## 7.4.1 Prepare for Data Collection

Phase 1 of the process, **Prepare for Data Collection**, involves activities that are key for establishing a comprehensive information security metrics program. These activities include the identification, definition, development, and selection of information security metrics, as well as developing a metrics program implementation plan.

After the metrics have been identified, specific implementation steps should be defined on how to collect, analyze, and report the metrics. These steps should be documented in the metrics program implementation plan. The following items may be included in the plan:

- Metrics roles and responsibilities, including responsibilities for data collection (both soliciting and submitting), analysis, and reporting;
- An audience for the plan;
- Process of metrics collection, analysis, and reporting that is tailored to the specific organizational structure, processes, policies, and procedures;
- Details of coordination with the Chief Information Officer (CIO), such as with risk assessment, security certification and accreditation, and FISMA reporting activities;
- Details of coordination between the CIO and other functions within the agency, external to the CIO (e.g., Information Assurance (IA), if separate from the CIO; physical security; personnel security; and critical infrastructure protection (CIP)) to ensure that the metrics data collection is streamlined and nonintrusive;
- Creation or selection of data collection and tracking tools;
- Modifications of data collection and tracking tools; and
- Metrics summary reporting formats.

## 7.4.2 Collect Data and Analyze Results

Phase 2 of the process, **Collect Data and Analyze Results**, involves activities that are essential for ensuring that the collected metrics are used to gain an understanding of system security and to identify appropriate improvement actions. This phase includes the following activities:

- Collect metrics data according to the processes defined in the metrics program implementation plan;
- Consolidate collected data and store it in a format (i.e., a database or a spreadsheet) conducive to data analysis and reporting;
- Conduct gap analysis, compare collected measurements with targets if defined, and identify gaps between actual and desired performance;
- Identify causes of poor performance; and
- Identify areas requiring improvement.

The causes of poor performance can often be identified using the data from more than one metric. For example, determining that the percentage of approved security plans is unacceptably low would not be helpful for determining how to correct the problem. To determine the cause of low compliance, collect information on the reasons for low percentages (e.g., lack of guidance, insufficient expertise, or conflicting priorities). This information can be collected as separate metrics or as implementation evidence for the percentage of approved security plans. Once this information is collected and compiled, the agency should develop a correction plan to address the root cause of the problem.

Root causes for faulty security run the gamut between highly technical...# Security Control Implementation Issues

Misconfiguration issues can arise from a lack of training or outdated policies or practices. Below are examples of causation factors that contribute to poor security control implementation and effectiveness:

## Causation Factors

- **Resources**: Insufficient human, monetary, or other resources.
- **Training**: Lack of appropriate training for the personnel installing, administering, maintaining, or using the systems.
- **System Upgrades**: Security patches that have been removed but not replaced during the operating system upgrades.
- **Configuration Management (CM) Practices**: New or upgraded systems that are not configured with required security settings and patches.
- **Software Compatibility**: Security patches or upgrades that are incompatible with software applications supported by the system.
- **Awareness and Commitment**: Lack of management awareness and/or commitment to security.
- **Policies and Procedures**: Lack of policies and procedures that are required to ensure existence, use, and audit of required security functions.
- **Architectures**: Poor system and security architectures that make systems vulnerable.
- **Inefficient Processes**: Inefficient planning and communication processes that influence the metrics.

## Identify Corrective Actions

Phase 3 of the process, **Identify Corrective Actions**, involves developing a plan that will provide the roadmap of how to close the implementation gap identified in Phase 2. This phase includes the following activities:

- **Determine Range of Corrective Actions**: Based on the results and causation factors, identify corrective actions that could be applied to each performance issue. Corrective actions may include changing system configurations; training security staff, system administrator staff, or regular users; purchasing security tools; changing system architecture; establishing new processes and procedures; and updating security policies.

- **Prioritize Corrective Actions Based on Overall Risk Mitigation Goals**: Several corrective actions may be applicable to a single performance issue; however, some may be inappropriate if they are inconsistent with the magnitude of the problem or are too costly. Applicable corrective actions should be prioritized for each performance issue in ascending order of cost and descending order of impact. The risk management process, described in NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, should be used for prioritizing corrective actions. If weights were assigned to metrics in Phase 1, Prepare for Data Collection, they should be used to prioritize corrective actions. Alternatively, weights may be assigned to corrective actions in Phase 3 based on the criticality of implementing specific corrective actions, the cost of corrective actions, and the magnitude of corrective actions’ impact on the organization’s security posture.

- **Select Most Appropriate Corrective Actions**: Up to three corrective actions from the top of the list of prioritized corrective actions should be selected for conducting a full cost-benefit analysis. These selections should then be appropriately reflected in the agency or system POA&Ms.

## Develop Business Case and Obtain Resources

Phases 4 and 5, **Develop Business Case** and **Obtain Resources**, respectively, address the budgeting cycle required for obtaining resources needed for implementing the remediation actions identified in Phase 3. The steps to develop a business case are based on industry practices and mandated guidance, including Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, the Clinger-Cohen Act, and GPRA. The results of the prior three phases will be included in the business case as supporting evidence. NIST SP 800-55 provides guidance on security practitioners’ inputs into the CPIC process and on their role in core development.# Business Case Guidance

Each agency should follow agency-specific business case guidance during this phase. Typically, the components and analysis of the business facilitate the completion of internal and external budget requests. A thorough examination of the business case will support and facilitate the obtaining resources process.

## 7.4.5 Apply Corrective Actions

Phase 6 of the process, Apply Corrective Actions, involves implementing corrective actions as determined through data analysis and as defined in an applicable business case or a POA&M. After corrective actions are applied, the cycle completes itself and restarts with subsequent data collection and analysis.

Iterative data collection, analysis, and reporting will track the progress of corrective actions through the POA&M, among others, measure improvement, and identify areas for further improvement to be included in tactical plans, Program Management Plans, or other agency planning mechanisms. The iterative nature of the cycle ensures that the progress is monitored, and the corrective actions are affecting system security control implementation in an intended way.

Frequent performance measurements will ensure that if corrective actions are not implemented as planned, or if their actual effect is not the desired effect, quick course corrections can be made internally by the agency, thus avoiding the unveiling of problems during external audits, security certification and accreditation efforts, or other similar activities.

# Chapter 8: Security Planning

Today’s rapidly changing technical environment requires that federal agencies adopt a minimum set of security controls to protect their information and information systems. The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the security requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.

The system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who access the system. It should reflect input from various managers with responsibilities concerning the system, including information owners, the system owner, and the senior agency information security officer (SAISO).

Agencies, at their discretion, can include additional information in the basic plan and add sections to the basic format prescribed herein, as long as the major sections described in this document are adequately covered and readily identifiable.

Program managers, system owners, and security personnel in the organization must understand the system security planning process. In addition, users of the information system and those responsible for defining system requirements should also be familiar with the system security planning process, as the system security plan is an important deliverable in the system development life cycle (SDLC) process.

Those responsible for implementing and managing information systems must participate in addressing security controls to be applied to their systems. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, specifies the minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems in seventeen security-related areas. Federal agencies must meet the minimum security requirements defined in FIPS 200 by using the security controls in National.# Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53

## Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems

### Overview
NIST SP 800-53 provides guidance on security controls for federal information systems. Additionally, NIST SP 800-18 Rev.1 offers a guide for developing security plans for these systems, including a Systems Security Plan Template in Appendix A. The following guidance outlines how to prepare a system security plan in accordance with federal requirements, adaptable to various organizational structures.

## 8.1 Major Applications, General Support Systems, and Minor Applications
All information systems must be covered by a system security plan and labeled as either a major application (MA) or a general support system (GSS). Specific system security plans for minor applications are not required, as their security controls are typically provided by the GSS or MA in which they operate.

In cases where a minor application is not connected to an MA or GSS, it should be briefly described in a GSS plan that either shares a common physical location or is supported by the same organization.

## 8.2 Security Planning Roles and Responsibilities
Agencies should develop policies regarding the system security planning process. System security plans are living documents that require periodic review, modification, and plans of action and milestones (POA&M) for implementing security controls. Procedures should outline who reviews the plans, maintains their currency, and follows up on planned security controls.

Additionally, procedures should ensure that system security plans are developed and reviewed before proceeding with the security certification and accreditation process for the system. During this process, the system security plan is analyzed, updated, and accepted. The certification agent confirms that the security controls described in the system security plan align with the FIPS 199 security category determined for the information system, and that threat and vulnerability identification, along with initial risk determination, is documented in the system security plan, risk assessment, or equivalent document.

The results of a security certification are used to reassess risks, develop the required POA&Ms to track remedial actions, and update the system security plan, providing a factual basis for an authorizing official to make a security accreditation decision.

### 8.2.1 Chief Information Officer
The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is the agency official responsible for developing and maintaining an agency-wide information security program. The CIO has the following system security planning responsibilities:
- Designating a Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO) to carry out the CIO's responsibilities for system security planning.
- Developing and maintaining information security policies, procedures, and control techniques to address system security planning.# Security Roles and Responsibilities

## 8.2.1 Common Security Controls
- Managing the identification, implementation, and assessment of common security controls.
- Ensuring that personnel with significant responsibilities for system security plans are trained.
- Assisting senior agency officials with their responsibilities for system security plans.
- Identifying and developing common security controls for the agency.

## 8.2.2 Information System Owner
The information system owner is the agency official responsible for the overall procurement, development, integration, modification, operation, and maintenance of the information system. The information system owner has the following responsibilities related to system security plans:
- Developing the system security plan in coordination with information owners, the system administrator, the information system security officer (ISSO), the Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO), and functional "end users."
- Maintaining the system security plan and ensuring that the system is deployed and operated according to the agreed-upon security requirements.
- Ensuring that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security training (e.g., instruction in rules of behavior) and assisting in the identification, implementation, and assessment of the common security controls.

## 8.2.3 Information Owner
The information owner is the agency official with statutory or operational authority for specified information and is responsible for establishing the controls for information generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal. The information owner has the following responsibilities related to system security plans:
- Establishing the rules for the appropriate use and protection of the subject data/information (rules of behavior).
- Providing input to information system owners on the security requirements and security controls for the information systems where the information resides.
- Deciding who has access to the information system and determining what types of privileges or access rights.
- Assisting in identifying and assessing the common security controls where the information resides.

## 8.2.4 Senior Agency Information Security Officer
The SAISO is the agency official responsible for serving as the Chief Information Officer's (CIO) primary liaison to the agency’s information system owners and ISSOs. The SAISO has the following responsibilities related to system security plans:
- Carrying out the CIO’s responsibilities for system security planning.
- Coordinating the development, review, and acceptance of system security plans with information system owners, ISSOs, and the authorizing official.
- Coordinating the identification, implementation, and assessment of the common security controls.
- Possessing professional qualifications, including training and experience, required to develop and review system security plans.

## 8.2.5 Information System Security Officer
The ISSO is the agency official assigned responsibility by the SAISO, authorizing official, management official, or information system owner for ensuring that the appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system or program. The ISSO has the following responsibilities related to system security plans:
- Assisting the SAISO in identifying, implementing, and assessing the common security controls.
- Actively supporting the development and maintenance of the system security plan, including coordinating system changes with the information system owner and assessing the security impact of those changes.

## 8.3 Rules of Behavior
The rules of behavior, which are required in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III,# Security Controls and Rules of Behavior

## Overview
Security controls are essential components outlined in NIST SP 800-53. They should clearly delineate responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals with access to the system.

## Rules of Behavior
The rules should state the consequences of inconsistent behavior or noncompliance and be made available to every user prior to receiving authorization for system access.

### Acknowledgment of Rules
It is required that the rules contain a signature page for each user to acknowledge receipt, indicating that they have read, understood, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior. Electronic signatures are acceptable for use in acknowledging the rules of behavior.

### Examples of Rules
Table 8-1 lists examples from OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, of what should be covered in typical rules of behavior. These are examples only, and agencies have flexibility in the detail and content.

When developing the rules of behavior, agencies should be aware that the intended function of this document is to make all users accountable for their actions by acknowledging that they have read, understood, and agreed to abide by the rules of behavior.

The rules, while not intended as a complete copy of the security policy or procedures guide, should cover, at a high level, some of the controls described in Table 8-1. Lastly, agencies can incorporate, by reference, the agency body of policies and procedures governing information security and other applicable policies in the text of the rules of behavior.

## System Security Plan Approval
Organizational policy should clearly define who is responsible for system security plan approval and procedures developed for plan submission, including any special memorandum language or other documentation required by the agency.

Prior to the security certification and accreditation process, the authorizing official, independent from the system owner, typically approves the plan.

### System Boundary Analysis and Security Controls
Before the system security plan can be developed, the information system and the information resident within that system must be categorized based on a FIPS 199 impact analysis.

Then a determination can be made as to which systems in the inventory can be logically grouped into General Support Systems (GSSs) or Major Applications (MAs). The FIPS 199 impact levels must be considered when the system boundaries are drawn and when selecting the initial set of security controls (e.g., control baseline).

The baseline security controls can then be tailored based on an assessment of risk and local conditions, including organization-specific security requirements, specific threat information, cost-benefit analyses, the availability of compensating controls, or special circumstances.

Common security controls, which is one of the tailoring considerations, must be identified prior to system security plan preparation to identify those controls covered at the agency level that are not system-specific. These common security controls can then be incorporated into the system security plan by reference.

### Security Planning
Figure 8-1 depicts how large GSSs can be broken down for the purpose of security planning. The process of uniquely assigning information resources to an information system defines the security boundary for that system. Agencies have great flexibility in this regard.# Information Systems and Security Controls

## 1. Information Systems

In determining what constitutes an information system (i.e., MA or GSS), if a set of information resources is identified as an information system, the resources should generally be under the same direct management control. Direct management control does not necessarily imply that there is no intervening management. It is also possible for an information system to contain multiple subsystems. A subsystem is a major subdivision or component of an information system consisting of information, information technology (IT), and personnel that perform one or more specific functions.

## 2. Security Controls

### 2.1 Overview

FIPS 200 provides seventeen minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems. The requirements represent a broad-based, balanced information security program that addresses the management, operational, and technical aspects of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information and information systems.

An agency must meet the minimum security requirements in this standard by applying security controls selected in accordance with NIST SP 800-53 and the designated impact levels of the information systems. An agency has the flexibility to tailor the security control baseline in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the standard.

### 2.2 Tailoring Activities

Tailoring activities include:
1. The application of scoping guidance.
2. The specification of compensating controls.
3. The specification of agency-defined parameters in the security controls, where allowed.

The system security plan should document all tailoring activities.

## 3. Scoping Guidance

Subsystems typically fall under the same management authority and are included within a single system security plan. Scoping guidance provides an agency with specific terms and conditions on the applicability and implementation of individual security controls in the security control baselines defined in NIST SP 800-53.

Several considerations can potentially impact how the baseline security controls are applied by the agency. System security plans should clearly identify which security controls used scoping guidance and include a description of the type of considerations that were made. The application of scoping guidance must be reviewed and approved by the authorizing official for the information system.

## 4. Compensating Controls

Compensating security controls are the management, operational, or technical controls used by an agency in lieu of prescribed controls in the low, moderate, or high security control baselines, which provide equivalent or comparable protection for an information system.

Compensating security controls for an information system will be used by an agency only under the following conditions:
1. The agency selects the compensating controls from the security control catalog in NIST SP 800-53.
2. The agency provides a complete and convincing rationale and justification for how the compensating controls provide an equivalent security capability or level of protection for the information system.
3. The agency assesses and formally accepts the compensating controls.# Risk Management in Information Systems

## Compensating Controls
The use of compensating security controls must be reviewed, documented in the system security plan, and approved by the authorizing official for the information system.

## Common Security Controls
An agency-wide view of the information security program facilitates the identification of common security controls that can be applied to one or more agency information systems. Common security controls can apply to:
1. All agency information systems.
2. A group of information systems at a specific site (sometimes associated with the term site certification/accreditation).
3. Common information systems, subsystems, or applications (i.e., common hardware, software, and/or firmware) deployed at multiple operational sites (sometimes associated with the term type certification/accreditation).

### Properties of Common Security Controls
Common security controls, typically identified during a collaborative agency-wide process involving the CIO, SAISO, authorizing officials, information system owners, and ISSOs (and by developmental program managers for common hardware, software, and/or firmware), have the following properties:
- The development, implementation, and assessment of common security controls can be assigned to responsible agency officials or organizational elements (other than the information system owners whose systems will implement or use those common security controls).
- The results from the assessment of the common security controls can be used to support the security certification and accreditation processes of agency information systems where those controls have been applied.

### Efficiency in Developing System Security Plans
For efficiency in developing system security plans, common security controls should be documented once and then inserted or imported into each system security plan for the information systems within the agency. Effectively maximizing the application of common controls in the system security planning process depends on the following factors:
- The agency has developed, documented, and communicated its specific guidance on identifying common security controls.
- The agency has assigned the responsibility for coordinating common security control identification and review and obtaining consensus on the common control designations with a management official, such as the CIO or SAISO, with security program responsibilities.
- System owners have been briefed on the system security planning process, including the use of common controls.
- Agency experts in the common control areas identified have been consulted as part of the process.

### Challenges in Implementation
While the concept of security control partitioning into common security controls and system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive, the application of this principle within an agency takes planning, coordination, and perseverance. If an agency is just beginning to implement this approach or has only partially implemented it, it may take some time to get the maximum benefits from security control partitioning and the associated reuse of assessment evidence.

Because of the potential dependence on common security controls by many of an agency's information systems, a failure of such common controls may result in a significant increase in agency-level risk—risk that arises from operating the systems that depend on these security controls.

## Security Control Selection
An agency must meet the minimum security requirements in FIPS 199 by selecting the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements.# Security Controls and Assurance Requirements

## Overview
The process of selecting the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements for agency information systems to achieve adequate security is a multifaceted, risk-based activity involving management and operational personnel within the agency.

## Security Categorization
Security categorization of federal information and information systems, as required by FIPS 199, is the first step in the risk management process. Subsequent to the security categorization process, an agency must select an appropriate set of security controls for their information systems that satisfy the minimum security requirements set forth in FIPS 200.

## Security Control Baselines
The selected set of security controls must be one of three security control baselines from NIST SP 800-53 that are associated with the designated impact levels of the agency information systems as determined during the security categorization process.

### Low-Impact Information Systems
- An agency must, at a minimum, use the security controls from the low baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP 800-53.
- The agency must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated with the low baseline are satisfied.

### Moderate-Impact Information Systems
- An agency must, at a minimum, employ the security controls from the moderate baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP 800-53.
- The agency must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated with the moderate baseline are satisfied.

### High-Impact Information Systems
- An agency must, at a minimum, use the security controls from the high baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP 800-53.
- The agency must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated with the high baseline are satisfied.

## Completion and Approval Dates
The completion date of the system security plan should be provided and updated whenever the plan is periodically reviewed and updated. The system security plan should also contain the date the authorizing official or the designated approving authority approves the plan. Approval documentation, e.g., accreditation letter, should be on file or attached as part of the plan.

## Ongoing System Security Plan Maintenance
Once the information system security plan is accredited, it is important to periodically assess the plan; review any change in system status, functionality, design, etc.; and ensure that the plan continues to reflect the correct information about the system. This documentation and its accuracy are imperative for system recertification and reaccreditation activity. All plans should be reviewed and updated, if appropriate, at least annually. Some items to include in the review are:
- Change in information system owner
- Change in information security representative
- Major change in system architecture
- Change in system status
- Additions/deletions of system interconnections
- Change in system scope
- Change in authorizing official

## Objective of System Security Planning
The objective of system security planning is to improve the protection of information system resources. All federal systems have some level of sensitivity and require protection as part of good management practice. The protection of a system must be documented in a system security plan. The completion of system security plans is a requirement of the OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources, and Title III of the E-Government Act, FISMA.

For the plans to adequately reflect the protection of the resources, a senior management official must authorize a system to process information or operate.# Authorization and Contingency Planning

## Authorization Overview
This authorization provides an important quality control. By authorizing processing in a system, the manager accepts its associated risk. Management authorization should be based on an assessment of management, operational, and technical controls. Since the system security plan establishes and documents the security controls, it should form the basis for the authorization, supplemented by the assessment report and the POA&Ms. In addition, a periodic review of controls should also contribute to future authorizations. Reauthorization should occur prior to a significant change in processing, but at least every three years.

## Chapter 9: Information Technology Contingency Planning
Information technology (IT) contingency planning is one modular piece of a larger contingency and continuity of operations (COOP) planning process that encompasses IT, business processes, risk management, financial management, crisis communications, safety and security of personnel and property, and continuity of government. Each piece is operative in its own right, but in concert creates synergy that efficiently and effectively protects the entire organization.

### Importance of Contingency Planning
Contingency planning for information systems is a required process for developing general support systems (GSS) and major applications (MA) with appropriate backup methods and procedures for implementing data recovery and reconstitution against IT risks. Risks to information systems may be natural, technological, or human in nature. Contingency planning consists of a process for recovery and documentation of procedures for conducting recovery.

### NIST Guidelines
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-34, *Contingency Planning for Information Technology Systems*, details a seven-step methodology for developing an IT contingency process and plan. Planning, implementing, and testing the contingency strategy are addressed by six of the seven steps; documenting the plan and establishing procedures and personnel organization to implement the strategy is the final step. SP 800-34 also includes technical considerations for developing recovery strategies.

### Contingency Planning Activities
Figure 9-1 highlights contingency planning activities involved in each step that should be addressed during all phases of the system development life cycle (SDLC). The capability to recover and reconstitute data should be integral to the information system design concept during the Initiation phase. Recovery strategies should be built into the GSS or MA’s architecture during the Development phase. The contingency processes should be tested and maintained during the Implementation phase; contingency plans should be exercised and maintained during the Operations/Maintenance phase. When the information system has reached the Disposal phase, the legacy system should remain intact and operational as a contingency to the replaced information system until, at least, the new system has been sufficiently tested. At some point, the legacy system may no longer support the needs of the organization, and the recovery strategy may transition away from the legacy system to a new recovery strategy designed during the Development phase of the new system.

## 9.1 Step 1: Develop Contingency Planning Policy Statement
When developing an IT contingency plan, the first step is to establish a contingency planning policy within the organization. This policy may exist at the department, agency, and/or program level of the organization. The statement...# Contingency Planning Guide

## 9.1 Step 1: Define Contingency Objectives
- Define the organization’s overall contingency objectives.
- Identify leadership, roles, and responsibilities.
- Determine resource requirements.
- Establish test, training, and exercise schedules.
- Develop maintenance schedules.
- Determine the minimum required backup frequency.

## 9.2 Step 2: Conduct Business Impact Analysis
A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a critical step to understanding the information systems components, interdependencies, and potential downtime impacts. Contingency plan strategy and procedures should be designed in consideration of the results of the BIA.

### BIA Process
1. Identify the system’s critical resources.
2. Examine each critical resource to determine how long functionality can be withheld from the information system before an unacceptable impact is experienced.

### Maximum Allowable Outage (MAO)
- The time identified is called a maximum allowable outage (MAO).
- Based on potential impacts, the amount of time the information system can be without the critical resource provides a recovery priority for planning recovery activities.

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- The balancing point between the MAO and the cost to recover establishes the information system’s recovery time objective (RTO).
- Recovery strategies must be created to meet the RTO and address recovering critical components based on their individual RTOs.

## 9.3 Step 3: Identify Preventive Controls
Implementing preventive controls might mitigate outage impacts identified by the BIA. Preventive controls are measures that detect, deter, and/or reduce impacts to the system.

### Common Preventive Measures
- Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
- Fire suppression systems
- Gasoline or diesel-powered generators
- Air conditioning systems with excess capacity
- Heat-resistant and waterproof containers for backup media and vital nonelectronic records
- Frequent, scheduled data backups

## 9.4 Step 4: Develop Recovery Strategies
When a disruption occurs despite the preventive measures implemented, a recovery strategy must be in place to recover and restore data and system operations within the RTO period. The recovery strategy is designed from a combination of methods that together address the full spectrum of information system risks.# IT Contingency Planning

## Development Phase

Several options may be evaluated during the Development phase; the most cost-effective option, based on potential impact, should be selected and integrated into the information system architecture and operating procedures.

## Data Backup

System data must be backed up regularly; therefore, all IT contingency plans should include a method and frequency for conducting data backups. The frequency of backup methods—daily or weekly, incremental or full—should be selected based on system criticality when new information is introduced.

The backup method selected should be based on system and data availability and integrity requirements (as defined in the BIA). Data that is backed up may need to be stored offsite and rotated frequently, depending upon the criticality of the system.

## Restoration Activities

Major disruptions to system operations may require restoration activities to be implemented at an alternate site. The type of alternate site selected must be based on RTO requirements and budget limitations. Equipment for recovering and/or replacing the information system must be provided as part of the recovery strategy.

Cost, delivery time, and compatibility factors must also be considered when determining how to provide the necessary equipment. Agencies must also plan for an alternate site that, at a minimum, provides workspace for all contingency plan personnel, equipment, and the appropriate IT infrastructure necessary to execute IT contingency plan and system recovery activities.

## Operational Readiness

The level of operational readiness of the alternate site is an important characteristic to determine when developing the recovery strategy. NIST SP 800-34 provides an overview of the common types of alternate sites.

## Recovery Strategy Implementation

The recovery strategy requires personnel to implement the procedures and test operability. Generally, a member of the organization’s senior leadership is selected to activate the plan and lead overall recovery operations. Appropriate teams of personnel (at least two people to ensure there is a primary and alternate available to execute procedures) are identified to be responsible for specific aspects of the plan.

Personnel should be chosen to staff the teams based on their normal responsibilities, system knowledge, and availability to recover the system on an on-call basis. A line of succession should be defined to ensure that someone can assume the role of senior leadership if the plan leader is unable to respond.

## Cost Considerations

Having selected choices for each component of the recovery strategy, the final consideration should be given to cost. The recovery strategy must meet criticality, availability, and RTO requirements while remaining within budget. Less obvious costs—such as shipping, awareness programs, tests and exercises, travel, labor hours, and contracted services—must also be incorporated into the evaluation.

## Step 5: Develop IT Contingency Plan

Procedures for executing the recovery strategy are outlined in the IT contingency plan. The plan must be written in a format that will provide the users (recovery team leadership and members) the context in which the plan is to be implemented and the direct procedures, based on role, to execute.

IT contingency plans are constructed using five components as depicted in Figure 9-2. The procedures are documented in the Notification/Activation Phase, Recovery Phase, and Reconstitution Phase components of the plan. The Supporting Information and Appendices components provide supplemental information necessary to understand the context in which the plan is to be used and gives additional information that may be necessary to execute procedures (e.g., emergency contact information and the BIA).# 9.6 Step 6: Plan Testing, Training, and Exercises

Personnel selected to execute the IT contingency plan must be trained to perform the procedures, the plan must be exercised, and the system strategy must be tested.

## Plan Testing Should Include:
- System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media
- System performance using alternate equipment
- Coordination among recovery teams
- Restoration of normal operations
- Internal and external connectivity
- Notification procedures

## Personnel Training Should Include:
- Purpose of the plan
- Security requirements
- Cross-team coordination and communication
- Team-specific processes
- Individual responsibilities
- Reporting procedures

## Plan Exercises
Plan exercises should be designed to individually and then collectively examine various components of the entire plan. Exercises may be conducted in a classroom setting: discussing specific components of the plan and/or impact issues; or they may be functional exercises: simulating the recovery using actual replacement equipment, data, and alternate sites.

# 9.7 Step 7: Plan Maintenance

The IT contingency plan must always be maintained in a ready state for use immediately upon notification. Periodic reviews of the plan must be conducted for currency of key personnel and vendor information, system components and dependencies, the recovery strategy, vital records, and operational requirements.

While some changes may be obvious (e.g., personnel turnover or vendor changes), others will require analysis. The BIA should be reviewed periodically and updated with new information to identify new contingency requirements and priorities. Changes made to the plan are noted in a record of changes, dated, and signed or initialed by the person making the change. The revised plan, or plan sections, are circulated to those with plan responsibilities. Because of the impact that plan changes may have on interdependent business processes or information systems, the changes must be clearly communicated and properly annotated in the beginning of the document.

# Chapter 10

## 10. Risk Management

An effective risk management process is an important component of a successful information security program. The principal goal of an organization’s risk management process is to protect the organization and its ability to perform its mission, not just its information assets. Therefore, the risk management process should not be treated primarily as a technical function carried out by the information security experts who operate and manage the information security system, but as an essential management function of the organization that is tightly woven into the system development life cycle (SDLC), as depicted in Figure 10-1.

Because risk cannot be eliminated entirely, the risk management process allows information security program managers to balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability. By employing practices and procedures designed to foster informed decision making, agencies help protect their information systems and the data that support their own mission.

Risk management is an aggregation of three processes that have their roots in several federal laws, regulations, and guidelines, including the Computer Security Act.# Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems outline three key processes:

1. Risk Assessment
2. Risk Mitigation
3. Evaluation and Assessment

If applied appropriately and with due diligence, this process meets the FISMA requirements of providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and information systems collected by and used by the federal government. It also ensures that information security management processes are integrated with agency strategic and operational planning processes.

## 10.1 Risk Assessment

To understand the risk assessment process, it is essential to define the term **risk**. NIST SP 800-30 defines risk as:

> "a function of the likelihood of a given threat source’s exercising a particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that adverse event on the organization."

In other words, where a threat intersects with a vulnerability, risk is present. With this definition of risk in mind, the goal of the risk assessment process is to identify and assess the risks to a given environment.

The depth of the risk assessment performed can vary greatly and is determined by the criticality and sensitivity of the system, as applied to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This process is described in detail in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199.

To meet the goal of the risk assessment, a nine-step process is defined in NIST SP 800-30 and summarized here. To simplify the process somewhat, the nine-step process described in NIST SP 800-30 is reduced to a six-step process, whereby Steps 4, 5, and 6 of the process are combined to create the **Risk Analysis** step.

### Risk Assessment Process Overview

The likelihood of a given threat successfully exploiting a given vulnerability is estimated by evaluating the threat source’s motivation, opportunity, and methods for conducting such an exploitation. The impact of a successful exploitation is estimated through an analysis of the effect the exploitation can have on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and the data it processes.

The determination of the criticality and sensitivity of the system, in terms of its confidentiality, integrity, and availability, is found by applying the concepts and processes discussed in detail within FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.

As mandated by OMB Circular A-130, the risk assessment process is usually repeated at least every three years for federal agencies. However, risk assessments should be conducted and integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for information systems, not because it is required by law or regulation, but because it is a good practice and supports the organization’s business objectives or mission.# Risk Assessment Steps

## 10.1.1 Step 1 – System Characterization

Characterizing an information system establishes the scope of the risk assessment effort, delineates the operational authorization (or accreditation) boundaries, and provides information (e.g., hardware, software, system connectivity, and responsible division or support personnel). This step begins with the identification of the information system boundaries, resources, and information.

When characterizing the system, the mission criticality and sensitivity (as previously identified using FIPS 199 to determine the system’s appropriate security categorization) are described in sufficient terms to form a basis for the scope of the risk assessment. The level of effort and the granularity (i.e., the level of depth to which the assessment investigates the security of the system) of the risk assessment are based on the FIPS 199 security categorization. For example, a system determined to be of low impact may not require hands-on security testing and evaluation.

Various techniques, such as questionnaires, interviews, documentation reviews, and automated scanning tools, can be used to collect the information needed to fully characterize the system. At a minimum, the system characterization describes the following individual system components:

- **Hardware** (e.g., IBM mainframe running the z/OS operating system, Dell server running Windows 2003)
- **Software** (e.g., Oracle, Apache web server, Microsoft Internet Information Server [IIS])
- **External interfaces** to other systems
- **Data**
- **People**

In addition to the component descriptions, the system characterization describes other factors with the potential to affect the security of the system, such as:

- **System functional requirements**
- **Organizational security policy and architecture**
- **System network topology**
- **Information flows** throughout the system
- **Management, operational, and technical security controls** implemented or planned to be implemented for the system
- **Physical and environmental security mechanisms**

The accuracy of the results from this step is essential to obtaining the best view of the risk profile of the system undergoing assessment, since this step provides the basis for the remaining steps. Inaccuracy at this point will propagate and lead to a cascade of analytical errors as the process progresses.

## 10.1.2 Step 2 – Threat Identification

Threat identification consists of identifying threat sources with the potential to exploit weaknesses in the system. This step should culminate in the development of a “threat statement,” or a comprehensive listing of potential threat sources. The threat statement must be tailored to the individual organization and its processing environment (e.g., end-user computing habits), which is accomplished by performing a threat evaluation, using the system characterization as the basis, for the potential to cause harm to the system.

There are common threat sources that typically apply, regardless of the system, that should be evaluated. These common threats can be categorized into three areas:

1. **Natural threats** (e.g., floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides)# Threat and Vulnerability Assessment

## 1. Types of Threats
Threats can be categorized into three main types:

1. **Natural Threats**:
- Examples include avalanches and electrical storms.

2. **Human Threats**:
- These can be intentional or unintentional actions that pose risks.

3. **Environmental Threats**:
- Such as power failures.

In general, information on natural threats (e.g., floods, earthquakes, storms) should be readily available, as known threats have been identified by many government and private sector organizations.

## 2. Information Sources
Intrusion detection tools are becoming more prevalent, and government and industry organizations continually collect data on security events, thereby improving the ability to realistically assess threats. Sources of information include, but are not limited to:

- Intelligence agencies (for example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Infrastructure Protection Center)
- United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) found at www.us-cert.gov
- Mass media, including Web-based resources.

## 3. Vulnerability Identification
NIST SP 800-30 defines vulnerability as “a flaw or weakness in system security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exercised (accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach or a violation of the system’s security policy.”

### Techniques for Identifying Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities can be identified using a combination of techniques and sources:

- Reviews of previous risk assessments, audit reports, and vulnerability lists (e.g., NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD), formerly known as I-CAT, found at nvd.nist.gov).
- Security advisories can also be used to begin the process of vulnerability identification.

### Security Testing Methods
System security testing can augment vulnerability source reviews and identify vulnerabilities that may not have been previously identified. Methods include:

- Automated vulnerability scanning tools
- Security, test, and evaluation (ST&E)
- Penetration testing

### Security Requirements Checklist
Developing a security requirements checklist based on the security requirements specified for the system during the conceptual, design, and implementation phases of the SDLC can provide a comprehensive inspection of the system.

The checklist can be developed using guidance from:

- NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems (draft)
- NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems

The results of the checklist can be used to evaluate compliance and noncompliance, identifying system, process, and procedural weaknesses that represent potential vulnerabilities.

## 4. Risk Analysis
The risk analysis is a determination (or estimation) of risk to the system. This analysis requires consideration of closely interwoven factors, such as:

- The security controls in place for the system under review
- The likelihood that those controls will be either insufficient or ineffective protection of the system
- The impact of that failure

In other words, it is not possible to estimate the level of risk posed by the successful exploitation of a given vulnerability without considering these factors.# Security Control Efficacy and Risk Assessment

## Overview
This document discusses the efficacy of security controls implemented to mitigate or eliminate potential exploitation threats. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the threat's motivation, opportunity, and capabilities, which contribute to the likelihood of a successful attack, as well as the impact on the system and organization if a vulnerability is successfully exploited.

## Key Steps in Risk Assessment
The following four steps are crucial in assessing risk:
1. Control Analysis
2. Likelihood Determination
3. Impact Analysis
4. Risk Determination

These steps are often performed simultaneously due to their interrelated nature.

### 10.1.4.1 Control Analysis
The analysis of controls in place to protect the system can be accomplished using a checklist or questionnaire based on the security requirements specified by NIST SP 800-53. This analysis can be refined using the NIST SP 800-53A, which provides guidance on testing security controls. The results of this analysis strengthen the determination of the likelihood that a specific threat might successfully exploit a particular vulnerability.

### 10.1.4.2 Likelihood Determination
Likelihood determination considers several factors:
- A threat source’s motivation and capability to exploit a vulnerability
- The nature of the vulnerability
- The existence and effectiveness of security controls

Likelihood ratings are described qualitatively as high, moderate, and low, indicating the probability of successful exploitation of a vulnerability by a given threat. For instance, if a threat is highly motivated and capable, and the protective controls are ineffective, the likelihood rating would be high. Conversely, moderate and low ratings indicate successively lesser degrees of likelihood.

### 10.1.4.3 Impact Analysis
Impact analysis assesses the potential consequences of a successful exploitation of a vulnerability. It considers:
- Impact to the systems and data
- Impact on the organization’s mission
- The criticality and sensitivity of the system and its data

FIPS 199 provides a consistent process for categorizing a system’s criticality and sensitivity across the three security domains: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. By determining a security category and assessing the organization’s mission through tools like mission-impact reports and business impact analyses, a rating can be established that describes the estimated impact on the system and organization should a threat successfully exploit a vulnerability.

## Conclusion
Understanding the interplay between control analysis, likelihood determination, and impact analysis is essential for effective risk management in information security.# Risk Assessment in IT Systems

## 1. Introduction
In the context of IT systems and data, the impact is generally described in qualitative terms. As with the ratings used to describe likelihood, impact levels are described using the terms of high, moderate, and low.

## 2. Impact Ratings
NIST SP 800-30 provides definitions for the impact ratings of low, medium, and high.

### 2.1 Risk Determination
Once the ratings for likelihood and impact have been determined through appropriate analyses, the level of risk to the system and the organization can be derived by multiplying the ratings assigned for threat likelihood (e.g., probability) and threat impact.

#### 2.1.1 Risk Calculation
Table 10-1 shows how to calculate an overall risk rating using inputs from the threat likelihood and impact categories using a 3x3 matrix. Depending on the requirements of the system and the granularity of risk assessment desired, 4x4 and 5x5 matrices may be used instead. The latter can include a Very Low/Very High threat likelihood and a Very Low/Very High threat impact to generate a Very Low/Very High risk level. A Very High risk level may require possible system shutdown or stopping all information system integration and testing efforts.

#### 2.1.2 Numeric Value Assignment
Because the determination of risk ratings for impact and threat likelihood is largely subjective, it is best to assign each rating a numeric value for ease of calculation. The rationale for this justification can be explained in terms of the probability assigned for each threat likelihood level and a value assigned for each impact level. For example:
- The probability assigned for each threat likelihood level is:
- 1.0 for high
- 0.5 for moderate
- 0.1 for low
- The value assigned for each impact level is:
- 100 for high
- 50 for moderate
- 10 for low

### 2.2 Risk Levels
Table 10-2 describes the risk levels shown in the above matrix. This risk scale, with its ratings of high, moderate, and low, represents the degree of risk to which an information system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exploited. It also describes the type of action senior managers must take for each risk level.

## 3. Control Recommendations
### 3.1 Goal of Control Recommendations
The goal of the control recommendations is to reduce the level of risk to the information system and its data to a level the organization deems acceptable. These recommendations are essential input for the risk mitigation process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.

### 3.2 Factors to Consider
This step is designed to help agencies identify and select controls appropriate to the organization’s operations and mission that could mitigate or eliminate the risks identified in the preceding steps. The following factors should be considered in recommending controls and alternative solutions to minimize or eliminate identified risks:
- Effectiveness of recommended options (e.g., system compatibility)
- Legislation and regulation# Risk Management Process

## 10.1 Results Documentation

The risk assessment report is the mechanism used to formally report the results of all risk assessment activities. The intended function of this report is to describe and document the risk posture of the system while it is operating in its stated environment (as described in the system characterization) and to provide organization managers with sufficient information so that they can make sound, risk-based decisions, such as resources that must be allocated to the risk mitigation phase. Lastly, the agency should ensure that the results of the risk assessment are appropriately reflected in the system’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) and System Security Plan.

At a minimum, the risk assessment report should describe the following:

- Scope of the assessment based on the system characterization;
- Methodology used to conduct the risk assessment;
- Individual observations resulting from conducting the risk assessment; and
- Estimation of the overall risk posture of the system.

## 10.2 Risk Mitigation

The second phase of the risk management process is risk mitigation. Because it is impractical, if not impossible, to eliminate all risk from a system, risk mitigation strives to prioritize, evaluate, and implement the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the risk assessment process based on the guidance provided in NIST SP 800-53.

System and organizational managers may use several options to reduce the risk to a system. These options are:

- Risk assumption;
- Risk avoidance;
- Risk limitation;
- Risk planning, research, and acknowledgement; and
- Risk transference.

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

Figure 10-4 illustrates a straightforward strategy that can be used to determine whether risk mitigation actions are necessary. Working from each risk identified and analyzed in the first process—risk assessment—managers must then decide whether the risk is acceptable or unacceptable and, subsequently, whether to implement additional controls or not to mitigate unacceptable risks. The first decision box in the figure applies to those threats involving intentional attacks. Natural and unintentional human errors are not considered in this decision-making scheme because there are no associated costs to consider, and so the strategy progresses to the next decision box.

Once the decision has been made on which risks are to be addressed in the risk mitigation process, a seven-step approach is used to guide the selection of security controls:

1. Prioritize actions;
2. Evaluate recommended control options;
3. Conduct cost-benefit analyses;
4. Select controls;
5. Assign responsibility;
6. Develop a safeguard implementation plan; and
7. Implement selected control(s).

The process of selecting controls to mitigate identified risks to an acceptable level is based on the security categorization of the system using the methodology provided in FIPS 199. The security categorization is used in two ways: (1) determines which minimum baseline security controls are selected from NIST SP 800-53.# Risk Management Process

## Overview
The risk management process involves estimating the level of risk posed by a threat/vulnerability pair identified during the risk assessment. For more details, refer to Chapter 5 of this handbook and NIST SP 800-30 for a discussion on identifying threat/vulnerability pairs.

## Security Control Selection
FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, mandates the use of NIST SP 800-53 for selecting minimum baseline security controls for government systems. The selected system security controls are grouped into three categories:
- **Management Controls**
- **Operational Controls**
- **Technical Controls**

These controls can be either preventive or detective in nature.

### Implementation of Security Controls
For new systems, once the security controls have been identified and refined, and an initial risk assessment conducted, the selected controls must be implemented. For legacy systems, the selected security controls are verified.

Organizations can leverage controls used among multiple systems by designating them as common controls, where implementation, assessment, and monitoring are conducted at an organizational level or by areas of specific expertise (e.g., human resources, physical security, building management).

The system owner must understand who is responsible for implementing these controls and identify the risk that this extension of trust will generate. For more information on common controls, see NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1.

### Residual Risk
It is impracticable to eliminate all risk. Even after the controls have been selected and implemented, some degree of residual risk will remain. The remaining residual risk should be analyzed to ensure that it is at an acceptable level.

For federal agencies, after the appropriate controls have been put in place for the identified risks, the authorizing official will sign a statement accepting any residual risk and either authorize the operation of the new information system or request continued processing of the existing information system. If the residual risk has not been reduced to an acceptable level, the risk management cycle must be repeated to identify a way of lowering the residual risk to an acceptable level.

## Evaluation and Assessment
The third and final phase in the risk management process is evaluation and assessment. The art of risk management in today’s dynamic and constantly changing information technology (IT) environments must be ongoing and continuously evolving. Systems are upgraded and expanded, components are improved, and architectures are constantly evolving.

### Security Control Evaluation
The security control evaluation and assessment, conducted during the Security Certification Phase of a system’s security certification and accreditation, provides input needed to finalize the risk assessment. The results are used to provide the Authorizing Official with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision on whether to authorize the operation of the information system.

Ideally, the risk assessment activities would be conducted at the same time the system is being certified and accredited. The reuse of assessment data will not only save valuable resources but also provide the most up-to-date risk information for the authorizing official.

### Dynamic Environment Considerations
Many of the risk management activities are conducted during a snapshot in time—a static representation of a dynamic environment. All the changes that occur to systems during normal, daily operations have the potential to adversely affect the security of the system in some fashion, and it is the goal of the risk management process to address these changes effectively.# Evaluation and Assessment Process

The evaluation and assessment process ensures that the system continues to operate in a safe and secure manner. This goal can be partially reached by implementing a strong configuration management program. In addition to monitoring the security of an information system on a continuous basis, agencies must track findings from the security control assessment to ensure they are addressed appropriately and do not continue to pose or introduce new risks to the system.

## Risk Management in the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The process of managing risk permeates the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), beginning with the early stages of project inception through the retirement of the system and its data. From inception forward, agencies should consider the possible threats, vulnerabilities, and risks to the system so that they can better prepare it to operate in its intended environment, securely and effectively, and within a select risk threshold, as deemed acceptable by an agency senior official during the security certification and accreditation process.

# Chapter 11: Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments

Security certification and accreditation are important activities that support a risk management process and are an integral part of an agency's information security program. The security certification and accreditation process is designed to ensure that an information system will operate with the appropriate management review, that there is ongoing monitoring of security controls, and that reaccreditation occurs periodically.

## Importance of Security Certification and Accreditation

Required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources, security certification and accreditation serve a function similar to quality control. It is the official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize the operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk on behalf of the agency. In this vein, it makes senior officials who accept risk fully accountable for their decisions, and in doing so, encourages diligence in the decision-making process.

## Legal Requirements

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, both require that federal agencies perform IT security risk assessments and prepare security plans for all systems. Both risk assessments and security plans are essential components of the security certification and accreditation process. Whether formal or informal, risk assessments provide much of the data needed to formulate a security plan that addresses the risks identified for a given system.

Both the risk assessment and the development and maintenance of a security plan that accurately reflects the security requirements and controls in place for a particular system must be incorporated into the system development life cycle (SDLC).

## Role of Security Assessments

In addition to risk assessments and system security plans, security assessments have an important role in security accreditation. It is essential that agency officials have the most complete and accurate information possible on the security status of their information systems in order to make timely and sound risk-based decisions.# Security Certification and Accreditation

## Overview
The information and supporting evidence needed for security accreditation are developed during a detailed security evaluation of a system, typically referred to as security certification.

## Security Certification
Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system. This assessment is made in support of security accreditation to determine the extent to which the controls are:

- Implemented correctly
- Operating as intended
- Producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system

The results of a security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the system security plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a security accreditation decision.

## Security Accreditation
By accrediting an information system, an agency official accepts the risks associated with operating the system and the implications on:

- Agency operations
- Agency assets
- Agency individuals

Completing a security accreditation ensures that an information system will be operated with appropriate management review, ongoing monitoring of security controls, and that reaccreditation occurs periodically in accordance with federal or agency policy and whenever there is a significant change to the system or its operational environment.

## NIST Special Publication 800-37
In May 2004, the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) published the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37, titled *Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems*. This publication provides specific recommendations on how to certify and accredit information systems and is applicable to all federal information systems, except those designated as national security systems as defined in 44 United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 3542.

State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations, are encouraged to use the guidelines as appropriate. The goals of the guidelines are as follows:

- Enable more consistent, comparable, and repeatable assessments of security controls in federal information systems
- Promote a better understanding of agency-related mission risks resulting from the operation of information systems
- Create more complete, reliable, and trustworthy information for authorizing officials to facilitate more informed security accreditation decisions

NIST SP 800-37 provides augmented, updated security certification and accreditation information to federal agencies and replaced Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 102, *Guidelines for Computer Security Certification and Accreditation*, September 1983, when it was rescinded in February 2005.

## Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments Roles and Responsibilities
While federal agencies have widely varied naming conventions/nomenclatures for IT security or security certification and accreditation roles, the basic functions in the security certification and accreditation process are essentially the same throughout all agencies. The security certification and accreditation process described in this Special Publication is flexible, allowing each agency to accomplish the intent of the specific tasks within their respective frameworks.# Organization

## 11.1.1 Chief Information Officer
The Chief Information Officer (CIO) works closely with authorizing officials and their designated representatives to ensure that an agency-wide security program is implemented effectively, including all aspects of the security certification and accreditation program component. The CIO has the following responsibilities in relation to security certification and accreditation:

- Promulgate cost-effective practices such as encouraging maximum reuse and sharing of security-related information to include:
- Threat and vulnerability assessments;
- Risk assessments;
- Results from common security control assessments; and
- Any other general information that may be of assistance to information system owners and their supporting security staffs.
- In concert with the authorizing official, determine appropriate allocation of resources for security programs and systems.
- In certain instances, operate as the authorizing official for agency-wide general support systems (GSS) or as co-authorizing official with other senior officials for selected agency systems.

## 11.1.2 Authorizing Official
The authorizing official (or designated approving/accrediting authority) is a senior management official or executive with the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to an agency. It is possible that a particular system may require more than one authorizing official. If so, agreements should be established among the authorizing officials and documented in the system security plan. In most cases, it may be advantageous to agree to elect a lead authorizing official to represent the interests of the other authorizing officials. The authorizing official has inherent U.S. government authority and, as such, must be a government employee. The authorizing official has the following responsibilities in relation to security certification and accreditation:

- Oversee the budget and business operations of the system.
- Approve system security requirements, system security plans, and memorandums of understanding (MOU) and/or memorandums of agreement (MOA).
- Make and issue final or interim decisions on granting, conditionally granting, or denying authority to operate the system.
- Appoint, if so chosen, a designated representative to act on the authorizing official’s behalf in coordinating and carrying out the necessary activities required during the security certification and accreditation of a system.

## 11.1.3 Senior Agency Information Security Officer
The Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO) (or supporting staff member) may serve as the authorizing official's designated representative. The SAISO serves as the CIO’s primary liaison to the agency’s authorizing officials, information system owners, and Information System Security Officers (ISSOs).

## 11.1.4 Information System Owner
The information system owner is responsible for the overall procurement, development, integration, modification, or operation and maintenance of an information system. The information system owner has the following responsibilities in relation to security certification and accreditation:# Security Certification and Accreditation Responsibilities

## System Security Plan
- Develop and maintain the system security plan.
- Ensure the system is deployed and operated according to the agreed-upon security requirements.
- Authorize user access to the information system (and with what types of privileges or access rights).
- Ensure system users and support personnel receive the requisite security training (e.g., instruction in rules of behavior).
- Inform key agency officials of the need to conduct a security certification and accreditation of the information system.
- Ensure appropriate resources are available for the security certification and accreditation effort.
- Provide necessary system-related documentation to the certification agent.
- Take appropriate steps to reduce or eliminate system vulnerabilities identified in the security certification and accreditation process.
- Assemble the security accreditation package and submit it to the authorizing official or authorizing official’s designated representative for adjudication.

## 11.1.5 Information Owner
The information owner has statutory or operational authority for specified information and is responsible for establishing the controls for its generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal. The information owner has the following responsibilities in relation to security certification and accreditation:
- Establish rules for appropriate use and protection of the subject information (e.g., rules of behavior).
- Communicate the level of information assurance required for the system with the appropriate system owner.

## 11.1.6 Information System Security Officer (ISSO)
The ISSO is responsible to the authorizing official, information system owner, or the SAISO for ensuring that the appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system or program. The ISSO has the following responsibilities in relation to security certification and accreditation:
- Serve as the principal advisor to the authorizing official, information system owner, or SAISO on all matters relating to the security of the information system.
- Perform or oversee the performance of day-to-day security operations of the system.
- Develop or assist in the development of system security policy.
- Ensure compliance with system security policy.
- Coordinate/manage changes to the system with the system owner and the information owner, as necessary.
- Assess the security impact of system changes.
- Develop and update the system security plan.

## 11.1.7 Certification Agent
The certification agent is either an individual, a group, or an organization responsible for conducting a security certification or a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of security controls in an information system. The impartiality and independence of the certification agent are important factors in assessing the credibility of the security assessment results and ensuring that the authorizing official receives the most objective information possible to make an informed, risk-based accreditation decision. The certification agent has the following responsibilities in relation to security certification and accreditation:
- Assess the system security plan to ensure the plan provides applicable security controls prior to initializing the certification process.
- Perform a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls.# Technical Controls in the Information System

- Recommend corrective actions to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in the information system.

## 11.1.8 User Representatives

Users are responsible for identifying mission/operational requirements and for complying with the security requirements and security controls described in the system security plan. User representatives are individuals that represent the operational interests of the user community and serve as liaisons for that community throughout the SDLC of the information system. The user representatives assist in the security certification and accreditation process, when needed, to ensure that mission requirements are satisfied while meeting the security requirements and using the security controls defined in the system security plan.

## 11.2 Delegation of Roles

At the discretion of senior agency officials, certain security certification and accreditation roles may be delegated and, if so, appropriately documented. Agency officials may appoint suitably qualified individuals, including contractors, to perform the activities associated with any security certification and accreditation role with the exception of the CIO and authorizing official. The CIO and authorizing official have inherent U.S. government authority, and those roles should be assigned to government personnel only. Individuals serving in delegated roles are able to operate with the authority of agency officials within the limits defined for the specific security certification and accreditation activities. Agency officials retain ultimate responsibility, however, for the results of actions performed by individuals serving in delegated roles.

## 11.3 The Security Certification and Accreditation Process

The security certification and accreditation process consists of four distinct phases, each further divided into well-defined tasks and subtasks. The four phases are:

- Initiation Phase
- Security Certification Phase
- Security Accreditation Phase
- Continuous Monitoring Phase

### Initiation Phase

The Initiation phase consists of three tasks:
1. Preparation
2. Notification and resource identification
3. System security plan review, analysis, and acceptance

This phase will ensure that the authorizing official and the SAISO agree with the contents of the system security plan before the certification agent begins assessing the security controls in the information system.

### Security Certification Phase

The Security Certification phase consists of two tasks:
1. Security control assessment
2. Security certification documentation

An information system must meet the minimum security requirements in FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, by implementing the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements as described in NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. System assessments are conducted by examining, reviewing, and testing the implementation of the appropriate security control baseline contained in NIST SP 800-53. The procedures for assessing and reporting the assessment results are contained in NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems.

The security certification phase determines the extent to which the security...# Security Accreditation Process

## Overview
Controls in the information system are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired system security posture. This phase also identifies specific actions taken or planned to correct security control deficiencies and to reduce or eliminate known system vulnerabilities. At the conclusion of this phase, the authorizing official should have sufficient data to assess the level of risk the system poses to the agency and render a security accreditation decision.

## Security Accreditation Phase
The Security Accreditation phase consists of two tasks:
1. Security accreditation decision
2. Security accreditation documentation

This phase is intended to help the accreditation authority determine whether the remaining known vulnerabilities in the system (after implementing an agreed-upon set of security controls) pose an acceptable level of risk to the agency. After successfully completing this phase, the information system owner will be facing one of three scenarios:
- Formal authorization to operate the information system is granted;
- An interim authorization to operate the information system under specific terms and conditions is granted; or
- Authorization to operate the information system is denied.

The Continuous Monitoring phase is discussed in section 11.6.

## 11.4 Security Certification Documentation
The security certification and accreditation process, in its entirety, culminates in a risk management decision by an agency official. The security accreditation package documents the results of the security certification and provides the authorizing official with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision on whether to authorize operation of the information system. The security accreditation package contains the following documents:
- Approved system security plan
- Security assessment report
- Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)

### System Security Plan
The system security plan provides an overview of the security requirements for the information system and explains the measures the information system owner has taken or plans to take to comply with those requirements. While not strictly required and left to the discretion of the agency, the plan may contain supporting appendices or references to other system security documents. Such documents may include the risk assessment, privacy impact assessment, contingency plan, configuration management plan, security configuration checklists, and any system interconnection agreements.

### Security Assessment Report (SAR)
The security assessment report summarizes the results of the activities undertaken by the certification agent. The security assessment report can also contain a list of recommended corrective actions and the completed system reporting form.

### Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)
The POA&M describes the measures that have been implemented or planned to correct any deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known system vulnerabilities.

Figure 11-1 provides an overview of the key sections of the security accreditation package.

## 11.5 Accreditation Decisions
The security accreditation package documents the results of the security certification. To ensure that the agency's business and operational needs are met...# Security Accreditation and Continuous Monitoring

## Security Accreditation Decision

The authorizing official should meet with the system owner prior to issuing the security accreditation decision. In this meeting, the certification and accreditation authorities should clearly explain the rationale for their risk-based decision and, where appropriate, fully explain the terms and conditions of the authorization.

### Components of the Security Accreditation Decision

The security accreditation decision communicates the accreditation authority’s decision and provides the information system owner with the following:

- **Security Accreditation Decision**: Official decision by the authorizing official on whether to accredit the system, accredit the system with conditions, or deny system accreditation.
- **Supporting Rationale for the Decision**: Justification for the authorizing official’s decision.
- **Terms and Conditions for the Authorization**: Limitations or restrictions placed on the operation of the system to which the system owner is bound.

The contents of security certification and accreditation-related documentation, especially information dealing with information system vulnerabilities, should be marked and protected appropriately in accordance with agency policy, and retained in accordance with the agency’s record retention policy.

## Continuous Monitoring

The Continuous Monitoring phase is an essential component in any security program. During this phase, the status of the security controls in the information system is checked on an ongoing basis. An effective continuous monitoring program can be used to support the annual FISMA requirement for assessing the security controls in information systems.

### Minimum Requirements for an Effective Monitoring Program

An effective monitoring program requires the following:

- **Configuration Management and Configuration Control Processes**: For the information system.
- **Security Impact Analyses**: On changes to the information system.
- **Assessment of Selected Security Controls**: In the information system and reporting of information system security status to appropriate agency officials.

To determine which security controls to select for review, agencies should first prioritize testing on POA&M items that become closed. These newly implemented controls should be validated. Agencies should test against system-related security control changes that occurred but did not constitute a major change necessitating a new C&A. Agencies should identify all security controls that are continuously monitored as annual testing and evaluation activities. Examples of this include (but are not limited to):

- Ongoing security training
- Denial of Service and Malicious Code protection activities
- Intrusion Detection monitoring
- Log File reviews

Once this is completed, agencies should look at the remaining controls that have not been tested for that year and make a decision on further annual testing based on risk, importance of control, and date of last test.

The results of continuous monitoring should be reported to the authorizing official and senior agency information security officer on a regular basis, and any necessary updates made to the system security plan. A continuous monitoring reporting form is provided in NIST SP 800-53A.

## Program Assessments

(Section content not provided in the original text.)# FISMA Information Security Program Requirements

## Overview
FISMA requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source.

## Annual Reviews
To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of information security controls, FISMA mandates that agency program officials and CIOs conduct annual reviews of the agency’s information security program and report the results to OMB. OMB uses this data to assist in its oversight responsibilities and to prepare an annual report to Congress on agency compliance with FISMA.

## Independent Evaluations
In addition, FISMA requires each agency to conduct an independent evaluation of its information security program each year.
- For agencies with an inspector general (IG), that evaluation is to be done by the agency IG.
- For agencies without an IG, the evaluation is to be done by an external auditor.

In either case, the agency annual report to OMB must include the independent evaluation.

## Quarterly Reporting
Each quarter, agencies prepare and submit Plan of Action and Milestone (POA&M) reports to OMB for all programs and systems where an information system security weakness has been found. Program officials shall regularly (at the direction of the CIO) update the agency CIO on their program to enable the CIO to monitor agency-wide remediation efforts and provide the quarterly update of the POA&M to OMB.

## Assessment Questionnaire
To assist agencies in meeting their annual FISMA reporting requirements, the Information Security Program Assessment Questionnaire contained in Annex 11.A provides questions on many of the areas typically required for inclusion in agency reports.

### Questionnaire Details
- The questionnaire contains agency-wide, program-level questions that are not found in NIST SP 800-53.
- It can be customized with agency-specific, program-related questions and can be completed by the CIO, the senior agency information security officer (SAISO), or an independent assessor evaluating the agency information security program.

### Cover Sheet
The questionnaire consists of a cover sheet and a series of questions which are answered for the Agency Information Security Program. The cover sheet requires descriptive information such as:
- The name of the agency, bureau, or agency-operating unit.
- The name, title, and organization of the individual completing the questionnaire.
- The date and time period covered in the report.
- The purpose of the assessment (e.g., annual assessment required by FISMA or due to repeated virus infections).
- The number of agency systems in the low, moderate, and high FIPS 199 impact categories.

### Questions
The series of questions are related to the management of an agency-wide information security program. Each question addresses information security program elements critical to the success of an agency information security program. This section is flexible and extensible, allowing the agency to add as many questions as desired to more fully assess the status and/or effectiveness of the agency information security program or to address questions or concerns raised by other interested parties.

Each question should be answered for each level of IT Security maturity:
- For the **Policy** maturity level, to answer "Yes," the topic should be documented in agency policy.
- For the **Procedures** maturity level, to answer "Yes," the topic should be documented in agency procedures.# Security Services and Products Acquisition

Information security services and products are essential elements of an organization’s information security program. Many products and services to support an agency’s information security program for information systems are widely available in the marketplace today and are frequently used by federal agencies.

## Selection and Use of Security Products and Services

Security products and services should be selected and used within the organization’s overall program to manage the design, development, and maintenance of its information security infrastructure, and to protect its mission-critical information. In the acquisition of both, agencies should apply risk management principles to aid in the identification and mitigation of risks associated with the acquisition.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

In the acquisition of information security products, agencies are encouraged to conduct a cost-benefit analysis as part of the product-selection process—one that also includes the costs associated with risk mitigation. This cost-benefit analysis should include a life cycle cost (LCC) estimate for the status quo and one for each identified alternative while highlighting the benefits associated with each alternative.

### NIST Guidelines

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-36, *Guide to Selecting Information Technology (IT) Security Products*, first defines broad security product categories and specifies product types, product characteristics, and environment considerations within those categories. The guide then provides a list of pertinent questions that agencies should ask when selecting products.

## Acquisition of Information Security Services

As with the acquisition of products, the acquisition of services bears considerable risks that federal agencies must identify and mitigate. The importance of systematically managing the process for acquisition of information security services cannot be underestimated because of the potential impact associated with those risks.

### Risk Management Processes

In selecting this type of service, agencies should employ risk management processes in the context of the information security services life cycle, which provides an organizational framework for information security decision-makers. NIST SP 800-35, *Guide to Information Technology Security Services*, provides assistance with the acquisition process.# Information Security Services

## Overview
The selection, implementation, and management of information security services guide the reader through the various phases of the information security services life cycle. Information security decision-makers must consider the costs involved, the underlying security requirements, and the impact of their decisions on the organizational mission, operations, strategic functions, personnel, and service-provider arrangements.

## Involvement in the Selection Process
The process of selecting information security products and services involves numerous people throughout an organization. Each person involved in the process, whether on an individual or group level, should understand the importance of security in the organization’s information infrastructure and the security impacts of their decisions. Depending on its needs, an organization may include all of the personnel listed below or a combination of particular positions relevant to information security needs:

- Chief Information Officer
- Contracting Officer
- Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative
- Information Technology (IT) Investment Review Board (IRB) or its equivalent
- Security Program Manager
- Information System Security Officer
- Program Manager (Owner of Data)/Acquisition Initiator
- Privacy Officer

## 12.1 Information Security Services Life Cycle
The security services life cycle provides a framework to help security decision-makers organize and coordinate their security efforts—from initiation to completion.

### Figure 12-1
*Depicts the security services life cycle for obtaining security services at a high level.*

### Table 12-1
*Provides a brief summary of each phase.*

## 12.2 Selecting Information Security Services
Before selecting specific services, organizations should review the current status of their security programs and the security controls that are either planned or in place to protect information systems and data. Organizations should use the risk management process to identify an effective mix of management, operational, and technical security controls that will mitigate risk to an acceptable level.

The number and type of appropriate security controls and their corresponding information security services may vary throughout a particular system’s services life cycle. The relative maturity of an organization’s security architecture is likely to influence the types of security controls that are appropriate for a particular system. The blend of security controls is tied to the mission of the organization and the role of the system within the organization as it supports that mission. A more in-depth look at the various types of security controls can be found in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, February 2006.

### Table 12-2
*Lists categories of information security services.*

Selecting the most appropriate services, service mix, and service level is a complex decision, as is deciding who should provide the needed services. A broad range of possible service arrangements exists. An organization may select its internal employees and teams to provide the service required, or it may choose to fully export the service to an external service provider. This external service provider could be any organization, including an external group from a subsidiary organization, a business unit, or a commercial service provider.

## 12.2.1 Selecting Information Security Services Management Tools
Because of the potential harm caused by inadequate security, information...# Security Program Management

## 1. Effective Management Tools
Security program managers and decision makers must employ effective management tools to increase the likelihood of success of acquired security services. Two important tools are:

### 1.1 Metrics
Metrics are a management tool that facilitates decision making and accountability through practical, relevant data collection, data analysis, and performance data reporting.

### 1.2 Service Agreements
A service agreement is an agreement between the service provider and the organization requesting the service that specifies all services the service provider is to provide, to what extent, the duration of services, etc.

## 2. Information Security Services Issues
Implementing a security service and service arrangement can be complex. Each security service carries its own costs and associated risks, as does each service arrangement. Making a decision based on one single issue can have major implications for the organization in other areas.

For example, if it becomes clear that an external organization can provide the service more cost-effectively than the current internal service provider, security decision makers will have to consider the implications to the organization’s current personnel. The decision makers will have to balance near-term cost/value with potential long-term risks associated with potential loss of employee morale, attrition, and intellectual capital.

### 2.1 General Factors and Issues
Table 12-3 provides a list of general factors and issues associated with acquiring security services, grouped into six categories. This list is not intended to be exhaustive; it provides the most common, but not all, related factors and issues.

## 3. General Considerations for Information Security Services
In identifying the service provider that best meets an organization’s needs, decision makers will need to have many questions answered.

### 3.1 Legislative and Regulatory Requirements
Depending on the nature of the data the service provider accesses and processes on behalf of the agency, the service provider may be subject to legislative and regulatory requirements, including:

- Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
- NIST standards and guidance, such as:
- SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
- SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems

Questions pertaining to these requirements should become part of the organization’s standard process for researching and evaluating information security services and service providers.

### 3.2 Sample Questions
Table 12-4 is a representative sample of such questions, which includes general questions grouped into the six issue categories. These questions are intended as a guide, and each organization will need to decide which questions are relevant to its specific needs. The questions are not an exhaustive list, and organizations should develop additional questions. Lastly, the questions may best be answered by the organization, not the service provider.

## 4. Selecting Information Security Products
As with security services, before selecting specific products, organizations should review the current status of their security programs and the security controls that are either planned or in place to protect their information and information systems.

### 4.1 General Issues for Consideration
Table 12-5 lists the general issues for consideration prior to the selection of security products.# Information Security Products

To facilitate identification and review of these considerations, security program managers may use a set of questions when considering security products for their programs.

## Product Selection Questions

Table 12-6 lists questions that are product-independent and should be posed during the product selection phase. These questions are organized into three categories:

1. **Questions that apply to the organization**
2. **Questions that apply to the product or its operation**
3. **Questions that apply to the vendor**

It should be noted, however, that these questions are neither exhaustive nor relevant in all circumstances. Organizations should use these questions as a guide, and edit and supplement the questions as required by their unique circumstances in addition to ensuring that their decisions are consistent with their architecture and a well-established business case.

### Examples of Product Types

Some examples of product types include:
- Access control
- Intrusion detection
- Other information security-related products

Before deciding to purchase any type of security product, decision makers should consider product capabilities, compatibility with other products, and environmental considerations, among others.

## 12.4 Security Checklists for IT Products

Vulnerabilities in IT products surface nearly every day, and many ready-to-use exploits are widely available on the Internet. Because IT products are often intended for a wide variety of audiences, restrictive security controls are usually not enabled by default, so many IT products are immediately vulnerable out of the box.

Security program managers should review the NIST SP 800-70, Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products, May 2005, which helps to facilitate the development and dissemination of security checklists so that organizations and individual users can better secure their IT products. A security configuration checklist (sometimes called a lockdown or hardening guide or benchmark) is, in its simplest form, a series of instructions for configuring a product to a particular operating environment.

## 12.5 Organizational Conflict of Interest

An organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may exist when a party to an agreement has a past, present, or future interest related to the work performed (or to be performed), which may diminish its capacity to provide technically sound, objective service or which may result in an unfair competitive advantage.

Agencies should do their best to avoid organizational conflicts before they arise. However, if an organization determines that an OCI exists but cannot be avoided and the organization wishes to proceed nonetheless, the head of the organization must formally waive the OCI.

Identifying the existence of OCIs, mitigating the effect of the OCI to an acceptable level, or waiving the OCI are important steps for consideration when managing the information security service life cycle. However, each of these is a complex matter involving legal and regulatory issues and, as such, should not be considered without the counsel of an organization’s legal department.

# Chapter 13

## 13. Incident Response

Attacks on information systems and networks have become more numerous, sophisticated, and severe in recent years. While preventing such attacks would be the ideal course of action for organizations, not all information systems...# Security Incident Management

Security incidents can be prevented. Every organization that depends on information systems and networks to carry out its mission should identify and assess the risks to its systems and its information and reduce those risks to an acceptable level. An important component of this risk management process is the trending analysis of past computer security incidents and identifying effective ways to deal with them. A well-defined incident response capability helps the organization detect incidents rapidly, minimize loss and destruction, identify weaknesses, and restore information technology (IT) operations rapidly.

## Federal Regulations and Responsibilities

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) specifically directs federal agencies to develop and implement procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directs federal agencies to identify in their FISMA report any incidents (physical or electronic) involving the loss of or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII) and report them according to the policies outlined in OMB Memorandum. Federal civilian agencies are responsible for reporting all computer security incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) in the Department of Homeland Security and for documenting the corrective actions taken and their impact. Specifically, agencies are responsible for reporting all incidents involving PII to the US-CERT within one hour of discovering the incident.

Further, policy guidance issued by the OMB in Circular No. A-130, Appendix III, requires that agencies have a capability to provide help to users after a system security incident occurs, and to share information concerning common vulnerabilities and threats.

## Incident Response Process

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, details a four-phase incident response process. The major phases of the incident response process—preparation, detection and analysis, containment/eradication/recovery, and post-incident activity—are described in detail throughout the rest of this chapter.

### 13.1 Preparation

Incident preparation involves not only establishing an incident response capability so that the organization is ready to respond to incidents but also preventing incidents by ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are afforded sufficient security. Incident prevention is now considered a fundamental component of incident response programs, also known as incident management programs, although the incident response team is not typically responsible for it. The incident response team’s expertise should be used to establish recommendations for securing systems and preventing incidents, as much as possible. This section provides an overview of actions needed to prevent and handle incidents, including incident data collection preparation.

#### 13.1.1 Preparing for Incident Response

Organizing an effective incident response capability involves the participation of...# Incident Response Program Planning

Many people within the organization play a role in establishing a successful incident response program. Making the right planning and implementation decisions is key. One of the first planning tasks should be to develop an organization-specific definition of the term **"incident"** so that the scope of the term is clear.

## Preparation Phase Tasks

Additional tasks that should be performed during the preparation phase include the following:

### Create an Incident Response Policy
- The policy should define what events are considered incidents.
- Establish the organizational structure for incident response.
- Define roles and responsibilities.
- List the organization’s incident reporting requirements.

### Develop Incident Response and Reporting Procedures
- Based on the incident response policy, standard operating procedures (SOPs) should delineate the specific technical processes, techniques, checklists, and forms used by the incident response team.
- SOPs should be comprehensive and detailed to ensure that the organization’s priorities are properly reflected in response operations.
- Following standardized response procedures is an effective way to minimize errors, particularly those that might be caused by incident handling pace and stress.
- Prior to implementation, the organization should test incident response SOPs to validate their accuracy and usefulness.
- Once validated, the SOPs must be widely disseminated throughout the organization.
- It is impractical to develop comprehensive procedures with step-by-step instructions for handling every incident; therefore, the organization should prepare to handle any type of incident, focusing on common types of incidents.

### Establish Guidelines for Communicating with External Parties
- During the incident response process, the organization may need to communicate with outside parties, including other incident response teams, law enforcement, the media, vendors, and external victims.
- Organizations should have predetermined communication guidelines to ensure that only the appropriate information is shared with the right parties.
- If sensitive information is inappropriately released, it can lead to greater disruption and financial loss than the incident itself.
- Creating and maintaining a list of internal and external points of contact (POC), along with backups for each contact, should assist in making communications among parties easier and faster.

### Define Incident Response Team Services
- Although the main focus of an incident response team is performing incident response, most teams offer additional services.
- Examples of the types of services an incident response team can provide include:
- Security advisory distribution
- Vulnerability assessment
- Intrusion detection
- Education and awareness

### Select a Team Structure and Staffing Model
- The organization should select the team structure and staffing model best suited to its needs.
- Factors to consider when contemplating the best team structure and staffing model include:
- Size of the organization
- Geographic diversity of major computing resources
- Need for 24/7 availability
- Cost
- Staff expertise

### Staff and Train the Incident Response Team
- Members of the incident response team should have excellent technical and problem-solving skills, as these are critical to the team’s success.
- Excellent teamwork, organizational, communication, and speaking skills are also important.
- Most incident response teams have a team manager and a deputy team manager who assumes authority in the absence of the team manager.
- Some teams also have a technical lead who assumes oversight of and final responsibility for the quality of the technical work performed by the entire incident response team.
- Larger teams often assign an incident lead as the primary POC for handling a specific incident.

Organizations typically find it challenging to maintain situational awareness for incidents.# Handling Large-Scale Incidents

Handling large-scale incidents is challenging due to their complexity. Many individuals within an organization may play a role in the incident response, and rapid and efficient communication with various external groups is often necessary. Collecting, organizing, and analyzing all pieces of information to make and execute the right decisions is not an easy task. The key to maintaining situational awareness is thorough preparation for handling large-scale incidents.

## Key Actions for Incident Response

Two specific actions that support effective incident response are:

### 1. Establish and Maintain Accurate Notification Mechanisms

Organizations should establish, document, maintain, and exercise on-hour and off-hour contact and notification mechanisms for various individuals and groups within the organization (e.g., chief information officer [CIO], head of information security, IT support, business continuity planning) and outside the organization (e.g., incident response organizations, counterparts at other organizations).

### 2. Develop Written Guidelines for Prioritizing Incidents

Incident response teams should handle each incident with the appropriate priority based on the criticality of the affected resources and the current and potential technical effects of the incident. For example, data destruction on a user workstation might result in a minor loss of productivity, whereas a root compromise of a public web server could lead to a major loss of revenue, productivity, access to services, and reputation, as well as the release of confidential data (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers).

Because incident responders typically work under stressful conditions that are prone to human error, it is crucial to clearly define and articulate the incident handling priority process. This process should include:

- A description of how the incident response team should react under various circumstances.
- A service-level agreement (SLA) that documents appropriate actions and maximum response times.

This prioritization should facilitate faster and more consistent decision-making.

## Preparing to Collect Incident Data

Organizations should be prepared to collect a set of objective and subjective data for each incident. Over time, the incident data collected can serve multiple purposes. For example:

- Data on the total number of hours the incident response team has dedicated to incident response activities and its cost over a specific period may justify additional funding for the incident response team.
- A study of incident characteristics may reveal systemic security weaknesses and threats, changes in incident trends, or other data that can support the risk assessment process.
- Properly collected and stored incident data should provide several measures of the success (or at least the activities) of the incident response team.

Furthermore, organizations required to report incident information will need to collect the necessary data to meet their requirements (e.g., FISMA reporting of annual incident statistics).

In preparing to collect incident data, organizations should focus on collecting actionable data rather than simply gathering data because it is available. Absolute numbers are not informative; understanding how they represent threats to and vulnerabilities of the organization's business processes is what matters. Organizations should decide what incident data to collect based on reporting requirements and the expected return on investment from the data.# Incident Response and Prevention

## 13.1.3 Preventing Incidents

Preventing problems is normally less costly and more effective than reacting to them after they occur. Thus, incident prevention is an important complement to an incident response capability. If security controls are insufficient, high volumes of incidents may occur, overwhelming the resources and capacity for response, which would result in delayed or incomplete recovery, possibly more extensive damage, and longer periods of service unavailability.

Incident handling can be performed more effectively if organizations complement their incident response capability with adequate resources to actively maintain the security of networks, systems, and applications. This process is intended to reduce the frequency of incidents, thereby allowing the incident response team to focus on handling serious incidents.

### Examples of Practices that Help to Prevent Incidents

- Having a patch management program to assist system administrators in identifying, acquiring, testing, and deploying patches that eliminate known vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
- Hardening all hosts appropriately to eliminate vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses.
- Configuring the network perimeter to deny all activity that is not expressly permitted.
- Deploying software throughout the organization to detect and stop malicious code.
- Making users aware of policies and procedures on the appropriate use of networks, systems, and applications.

## 13.2 Detection and Analysis

Detection and analysis are, for many organizations, the most challenging aspects of the incident response process. In other words, accurately detecting and assessing possible incidents—determining whether an incident has occurred and, if so, the type, extent, and magnitude of the problem.

Incidents can be detected through many different means, with varying levels of detail and fidelity. Automated detection capabilities include network-based and host-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs), antivirus software, and log analyzers. Incidents may also be detected through manual means, such as user reports. Some incidents have overt signs that can be easily detected, whereas others are virtually undetectable without automation.

In a typical organization, the thousands or millions of possible signs of incidents that occur any given day are recorded mainly by computer security software. Automation is needed to perform an initial analysis of the data and select events of interest for human review. Event correlation software and centralized logging can be of great value in automating the analysis process. However, the effectiveness of the process depends on the quality of the data that goes into it. Organizations should establish logging standards and procedures to ensure that adequate information is collected by logs and security software and that the data is reviewed regularly.

Proper and efficient reviews of incident-related data require people with extensive, specialized technical knowledge and experience. When a potential incident is identified, the incident response team should work quickly to analyze and validate it, documenting each step taken. The team should rapidly perform an initial analysis to determine the incident’s scope, attack, and other relevant factors.# Incident Response Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the methods and targeted vulnerabilities that incident response teams should consider when prioritizing activities, including the containment of incidents.

## Prioritization and Escalation
- When in doubt, incident handlers should assume the worst until additional analyses indicate otherwise.
- Organizations should establish an escalation process for instances when the incident response team fails to respond to an incident within the designated time.

## Record Keeping
- The incident response team should maintain records about the status of incidents and other pertinent information.
- Using an application or database is necessary to ensure that incidents are handled and resolved in a timely manner.
- The incident response team should safeguard this data, as it often contains sensitive information regarding recent security breaches, exploited vulnerabilities, and users that may have performed inappropriate actions.

## Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

### Containment
- It is crucial to contain an incident before it spreads to avoid overwhelming resources and increasing damage.
- Most incidents require containment, so it is important to consider it early in the handling process.
- Decision-making is essential for containment, which may involve:
- Shutting down a system
- Disconnecting it from the network
- Disabling certain system functions
- Organizations should define acceptable risks and develop strategies accordingly.

### Containment Strategies
- Containment strategies vary based on the type of incident. For example:
- The strategy for containing an e-mail-borne virus infection differs from that of a network-based distributed denial of service attack.
- Organizations should create separate containment strategies for each major type of incident.
- The criteria for choosing the appropriate strategy should be documented clearly to facilitate quick and effective decision-making. Examples of criteria include:
- Potential damage to and theft of resources
- The need to preserve evidence
- The effectiveness of the strategy
- The time and resources needed to implement the strategy
- The duration of the solution

### Eradication
- After containment, eradication may be necessary to eliminate components of the incident, such as:
- Deleting malicious code
- Disabling breached user accounts
- For some incidents, eradication may be unnecessary or performed during recovery.

### Recovery
- Recovery involves restoring systems to normal operation and, if applicable, hardening systems to prevent similar incidents.
- Recovery actions may include:
- Restoring systems from clean backups
- Rebuilding systems from scratch
- Replacing compromised files with clean versions
- Installing patches
- Changing passwords# Security and Incident Management

## Tightening Network Perimeter Security
- Tightening network perimeter security (e.g., firewall rule sets).
- It is also often desirable to employ higher levels of system logging or network monitoring as part of the recovery process.
- Once a resource is successfully attacked, it is often attacked again, or other resources within the organization are attacked in a similar manner.

## Post-Incident Activity
After a major incident has been handled, the organization should hold a lessons-learned meeting to:
- Review the effectiveness of the incident handling process.
- Identify necessary improvements to existing security controls and practices.

Lessons-learned meetings should also be held periodically for lesser incidents. The information accumulated from all lessons-learned meetings, as well as the data collected while handling each incident, should be used to:
- Identify systemic security weaknesses and deficiencies in policies and procedures.
- Generate follow-up reports for each resolved incident, which can be important for evidentiary purposes, used as a reference in handling future incidents, and used in training new incident response team members.

An incident database, with detailed information on each incident that occurs, can be another valuable source of information for incident handlers.

# Chapter 14: Configuration Management

## Purpose of Configuration Management
The purpose of Configuration Management (CM) is to manage the effects of changes or differences in configurations on an information system or network. CM assists in:
- Streamlining change management processes.
- Preventing changes that could detrimentally affect the security posture of a system before they happen.

In its entirety, the CM process reduces the risk that any changes made to a system (insertions/installations, deletions/uninstalling, and modifications) result in a compromise to system or data confidentiality, integrity, or availability by providing a repeatable mechanism for effecting system modifications in a controlled environment.

In accordance with the CM process, system changes must be tested prior to implementation to observe the effects of the change, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse results.

## Considerations for Effective CM
Each organization must take into account:
- Associated costs and expenses.
- Required planning and scheduling.
- Necessary training associated with a thorough and effective CM process.

However, since each general CM approach is universal, agencies can structure and implement a repeatable CM process to save organizational resources on future projects. Additionally, CM helps to eliminate the risk of confusion, problems, and unnecessary spending. The additional resources required to correct a problem that could have been prevented through sound CM practices are likely to far exceed the amount of resources required to develop and implement an effective enterprise CM process.

## NIST Guidelines
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-64, *Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle*, states:
> "Configuration management and control procedures are critical to establishing an initial baseline of hardware, software, and firmware components for the information system and subsequently to controlling and maintaining an accurate inventory of any changes to the system. Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware of a system can have a significant impact on the security of the system... changes should be documented, and their potential impact on security should be assessed regularly."

NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1, defines seven CM controls that...# Configuration Management in the System Development Life Cycle

Organizations are required to implement based on an information system’s security categorization. The required CM controls are defined in Table 14-1.

## 14.1 Configuration Management in the System Development Life Cycle

Although Configuration Management (CM) is not traditionally regarded as a security function, it must be addressed in the system development life cycle (SDLC) because of its serious security implications. CM is just one component of an information system’s security posture. It falls under the operational controls of an information system and is interrelated with numerous other security disciplines such as project management, risk management, security certification and accreditation, and security awareness training.

CM should be addressed throughout the entire life cycle of any given project or task. As mentioned earlier, it is nearly impossible to carry out a systems development or management project with success in the absence of a sound and effective CM process. In the SDLC, the planning of the CM process falls in Phases 2 and 3; the primary implementation of the CM process is performed during Phase 4, the Operations/Maintenance phase. SDLC and its associated key tasks are depicted in Figure 14-1.

### Phase 2: Acquisition/Development

During Phase 2, the risk management process begins with the initial risk assessment. NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, defines risk management as “the process that allows information technology (IT) managers to balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by protecting the information systems and data that support their organizations’ missions.” Risk management encompasses the process of identifying, analyzing, and responding to risk. This process includes identifying existing vulnerabilities in a system or in its respective components.

Since risk is oftentimes an uncertainty on whether or not a given event will occur, an executable plan must be in place if a potential risk is exploited. Risk identification involves determining the possible effect on an information system due to a risk. During this phase, initial baselines of security controls are being selected based on assessing the risk level of a network. After the security controls are established, the CM process can begin. The documented CM process should contain procedures and techniques to change a system without detrimentally impacting it, change any interconnected systems, or change the network while accounting for the established security level of the network.

### Phase 3: Implementation/Assessment

Through Phase 3, Implementation/Assessment, security controls that are selected in Phase 2 are being tested. Also, the security certification and accreditation process takes place. NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, defines security accreditation as “the official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.”

Within the security certification and accreditation process are four phases: Initiation, Security Certification, Security Accreditation, and Continuous Monitoring. The fourth phase, Continuous Monitoring, primarily deals with CM.

> With regard to configuration management and control, it is important to document the...# Configuration Management

## Proposed or Actual Changes
Documenting information system changes and assessing the potential impact those changes may have on the security of the system is an essential aspect of continuous monitoring and maintaining the security accreditation.

In Phase 4, Operations/Maintenance, CM change control and auditing steps take place. If there was a significant change addressed in the CM process, then the system must be recertified and reaccredited. Constant monitoring of the system is performed to identify possible risks to the system so these can be addressed through the risk management, security certification and accreditation, and CM processes.

## 14.2 Configuration Management Roles and Responsibilities
There are many roles associated with implementing an effective CM process. Note that an individual is not limited to a single role (e.g., an individual can be both the system owner and the CM manager). An organization must ensure that management is aware of proposed changes and verify that a thorough review and approval process is in place. Also, separation of duties must be addressed to ensure that changes are being implemented only after being tested and approved.

### Roles and Responsibilities
- **Chief Information Officer (CIO)**: The CIO is responsible for setting forth policies concerning CM and implementing CM at the highest level for the organization.

- **System Owner**: The system owner serves as the authority for all matters of CM for the system. The system owner is responsible for developing functional requirements and verifying that the requirements are implemented appropriately.

- **Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO)**: The ISSO is primarily responsible for addressing security concerns related to the CM program and for providing expertise and decision support to the Configuration Control Review Board (CCRB).

- **Configuration Control Review Board (CCRB)**: CM responsibilities of the CCRB include:
- Discussing and resolving change requests that require additional funding or resources to implement.
- Ensuring that change requests do not adversely affect any systems or services related to the system or associated systems, subsystems, and facilities.
- Evaluating CM metric information on funding and other CM-related issues.

- **CM Manager**: The CM manager is responsible for day-to-day activities, including:
- Documenting and implementing the CM plan.
- Establishing system baselines and evaluating controls.
- Ensuring that proposed changes do not adversely affect agency systems or data.
- Managing change requests and coordinating implementation of changes.
- Conducting impact analysis of changes.
- Approving, denying, or deferring changes.
- Notifying users of system changes.
- Ensuring existence of a process for storing, retrieving, and distributing CM materials.
- Ensuring that an audit trail of changes is documented and maintained.

- **System Users**: System users are responsible for reporting any weaknesses or new requirements that are identified in current versions of the software.

- **Developers**: The developers are responsible for coordinating and working with the CM manager to identify, resolve, and implement controls and other CM issues.

## 14.3 Configuration Management Process
The CM process identifies the steps required to ensure that all changes are properly requested, evaluated, and authorized. The CM process also provides a detailed, step-by-step procedure for identifying, processing, tracking, and managing changes.# Documenting Changes in Change Management (CM) Process

An example CM process is depicted in Figure 14-2.

## Step 1: Identify Change

The first step of the CM process begins with a person or process associated with the information system identifying a need for a change. The change can be initiated by numerous individuals, such as users or system owners, or they may be identified by audit findings or other reviews. A change may consist of updating the fields or records of a database to upgrading the operating system with the latest security patches. Once the need for a change has been identified, a change request should be submitted to the appropriate decision-making body.

## Step 2: Evaluate Change Request

After initiating a change request, the effects that the change may have on the system or other interrelated systems must be evaluated. An impact analysis of the change should be conducted using the following as a guideline:

- Whether the change is viable and improves the performance or the security of the system;
- Whether the change is technically correct, necessary, and feasible within the system constraints;
- Whether system security will be affected by the change;
- Whether associated costs for implementing the change were considered; and
- Whether security components are affected by the change.

## Step 3: Implementation Decision

Once the change has been evaluated and tested, one of the following actions should be taken:

- **Approve:** Implementation is authorized and may occur at any time after the appropriate authorization signature has been documented.
- **Deny:** Immediate denial of the request regardless of circumstances and information provided.
- **Defer:** Immediate decision is postponed until further notice. In this situation, additional testing or analysis may be needed before a final decision can be made.

## Step 4: Implement Approved Change Request

Once the decision to implement the change has been made, it should be moved from the test environment into production. If required, the personnel updating the production environment should be separate from those individuals that developed the change to provide a greater assurance that unapproved changes do not get implemented into production.

## Step 5: Continuous Monitoring

The CM process calls for continuous system monitoring to ensure that it is operating as intended and that implemented changes do not adversely impact either the performance or security posture of the system. Agencies can achieve the goals of continuous system monitoring by performing configuration verification tests to ensure that the selected configuration for a given system has not been altered outside of the established CM process.

In addition to configuration verification tests, agencies can also perform system audits. Both configuration verification tests and system audits entail an examination of characteristics of the system and supporting documentation to verify that the configuration meets user needs and ensure that the current configuration is the approved system configuration baseline.

As part of the overall CM process, agencies should also perform patch management activities during this step. Patch management assists in the process of lowering the potential risk to a network by "patching" or repairing known vulnerabilities.# Vulnerabilities in Network and System Environments

Vulnerabilities in any of the network or system environments can pose significant risks. Increasingly, vendors are proactive in developing and releasing to the public fixes (or antidotes) to known vulnerabilities. Agencies must remain vigilant to ensure that they capture all relevant fixes as they are released, test their implementation for adverse effects, and implement them if deemed appropriate after testing is concluded.

## Patching and the Life Cycle Phases

Patching is associated with Phase 4 in the life cycle as well as with Phases 2 and 3.

### Phase 2: Risk Management

In Phase 2, patch management relates to risk management to prevent any vulnerability from being exploited and compromised.

### Phase 3: Testing

Phase 3 contains the testing to ensure that any change (including the patching) does not negatively impact the system.
