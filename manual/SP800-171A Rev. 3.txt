Abstract
The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is of paramount importance to
federal agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal Government to successfully
conduct its essential missions and functions. This publication provides organizations with
assessment procedures and a methodology that can be used to conduct assessments of the
security requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified
Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations. The assessment procedures are flexible
and can be customized to the needs of organizations and assessors. Assessments can be
conducted as independent, third-party assessments or as government-sponsored assessments.
The assessments can be applied with various degrees of rigor based on customer-defined depth
and coverage attributes.
1. Introduction
The security assessment process gathers information and produces evidence to determine the
effectiveness of security requirements by:
• Identifying potential problems or shortfalls in security and risk management programs
• Identifying security weaknesses and deficiencies in systems and the environments in
which those systems operate
• Prioritizing risk mitigation decisions and activities
• Confirming that identified security weaknesses and deficiencies in the system and
environment of operation have been addressed
• Supporting continuous monitoring activities and providing information security
situational awareness
1.1. Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of this publication is to provide procedures for assessing the security requirements
in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in
Nonfederal Systems and Organizations [3]. Organizations can use the assessment procedures to
generate evidence that the security requirements have been satisfied. The scope of the security
assessments conducted using the procedures described in this publication is guided and
informed by the system security plans for systems that process, store, or transmit CUI. The
assessment procedures offer the flexibility to customize assessments based on organizational
policies and requirements, known threat and vulnerability information, system and platform
dependencies, operational considerations, and tolerance for risk.
1.2. Organization of This Publication
The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:
• Section 2 describes the fundamental concepts associated with assessments of security
requirements, including assessment procedures, methods, objects, and assurance cases
that can be created using the evidence produced during assessments.
• Section 3 provides assessment procedures for the security requirements in SP 800-171,
including assessment objectives and potential assessment methods and objects for each
procedure.
The following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI:

• Appendix A: Acronyms
• Appendix B: Glossary
• Appendix C: Security Requirement Assessments
• Appendix D: Organization-Defined Parameters
• Appendix E: Change Log
The contents of this publication can be used for many different assessment-related purposes
to determine organizational compliance with the security requirements. The broad range of
potential assessment methods and objects listed in this publication does not necessarily
reflect and should not be directly associated with actual compliance or noncompliance.
Rather, the selection of specific assessment methods and objects from the list provided can
help generate a picture of overall compliance with the security requirements. There is no
expectation about the number of methods or objects needed to determine compliance with
the security requirements. Moreover, the entire list of potential assessment objects should
not be viewed as required artifacts needed to determine compliance. Organizations have
the flexibility to determine the specific methods and objects sufficient to obtain the needed
evidence to support any claims of compliance.
2. The Fundamentals
The process used by organizations and assessors to assess the security requirements in SP 800-
171 [3] includes (1) preparing for the assessment, (2) developing a security assessment plan, (3)
conducting the assessment, and (4) documenting, analyzing, and reporting the assessment
results. The remainder of this section describes the structure and content of the procedures
used to assess the security requirements and the importance of assurance cases in providing
the evidence necessary to determine compliance with the requirements.
2.1. Assessment Procedures
The security requirements in SP 800-171 are organized into 17 families, as illustrated in Table 1.
The assessment procedures in Sec. 3 are grouped by similar family designations to ensure the
completeness and consistency of assessments. The procedures have been derived from the
assessment procedures in SP 800-53A [5].
An assessment procedure consists of an assessment objective and a set of potential assessment
methods and objects that can be used to conduct the assessment. Each potential assessment
objective includes a determination statement related to the security requirement. If there is an
organization-defined parameter (ODP) in the security requirement, then the assessment
objective begins with a determination statement related to the definition of the ODP. The
determination statements are linked to the content of the security requirements to help ensure
traceability of the assessment results to the requirements.
Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and can include specifications,
mechanisms, activities, and individuals. Specifications are the documented artifacts (e.g.,
plans, policies, procedures, requirements, functional and assurance specifications, design
documentation, and architectures) associated with a system. Mechanisms are the hardware,
software, and firmware safeguards implemented within a system. Activities are the protection-related actions supporting a system that involve people (e.g., conducting system backup 
operations, exercising an incident response plan, and monitoring network traffic). Individuals
are the people applying the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.
Assessment methods define the nature and extent of the assessor's actions and are used to
facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The assessment methods
include examine, interview, and test. The examine method is the process of reviewing, studying,
inspecting, or analyzing assessment objects. The interview method is the process of holding
discussions with individuals or groups about assessment objects. The test method is the process
of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities, mechanisms) under specified conditions to
compare actual with expected behavior. Assessment methods include attributes of depth and
coverage, which define the rigor, scope, and level of effort for the assessment as well as the
degree of assurance that the security requirements have been satisfied. See SP 800-53A,
Appendix C, Assessment Method Descriptions [5].
The structure and content of an assessment procedure are provided in the example below:
03.01.06 Least Privilege – Privileged Accounts
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
Determine if:
A.03.01.06.ODP[01]: personnel or roles to which privileged accounts on the system are to
be restricted are defined.
A.03.01.06.a: privileged accounts on the system are restricted to <A.03.01.06.ODP[01]:
personnel or roles>.
A.03.01.06.b: users (or roles) with privileged accounts are required to use non-privileged
accounts when accessing non-security functions or non-security information.
ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
Examine

system-generated privileged accounts; list of system administration personnel; system audit
records; system configuration settings; system security plan; list of system-generated
security functions or security-relevant information assigned to system accounts or roles;

Determination statements have alphanumeric identifiers. Each determination statement begins
with the letter "A" to indicate that it is part of an assessment procedure. The next sequence of
numbers or letters (e.g., 03.01.01.e or 03.01.01.f.02) indicates the security requirement
identifier from NIST SP 800-171 (and the specific control item if it is a multi-part requirement)
that is the target of the assessment. Organization-defined parameters are indicated by the
letters "ODP." If there are multiple ODPs in the determination statement, the ODP number is
indicated in a square bracket (e.g., A.03.01.08.ODP[01]). Square brackets are also used to
denote when an assessment procedure further decomposes a requirement into more granular
determination statements (e.g., A.03.01.12.a[01], A.03.01.12.a[02], A.03.01.12.a[03]).
The application of an assessment procedure to a security requirement produces assessment
results or findings. The findings are compiled and used as evidence to determine whether the
security requirement has been satisfied or other than satisfied. A finding of satisfied indicates
that the assessment objective has been met, producing a fully acceptable result. A finding of
other than satisfied indicates that there are potential anomalies that may need to be addressed
by the organization. A finding of other than satisfied may also indicate that the assessor was
unable to obtain sufficient information to make the determination called for in the
determination statement.
2.2. Assurance Cases
Building an effective assurance case to determine compliance with security requirements
involves compiling evidence from a variety of sources and conducting different types of
activities during an assessment. An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into an
argument demonstrating that some claim about a system is true. For security assessments
conducted using the procedures in this publication, that claim is "compliance" with the security
requirements in SP 800-171. Assessors obtain evidence during security assessments to allow
designated officials to make objective determinations about compliance with the security
requirements. The evidence needed to make such determinations can be obtained from various
sources, including independent, third-party assessments or other types of assessments,
depending on the needs of the organization establishing the requirements and the organization
conducting the assessments.
For example, many technical security requirements are satisfied by security capabilities that are
built into commercial information technology products and systems. Product assessments are
typically conducted by independent, third-party testing organizations. These assessments
examine the security functions of products and established configuration settings. Assessments
can also be conducted to demonstrate compliance with industry, national, or international
security standards as well as developer and vendor claims. Since many information technology 
products are assessed by commercial testing organizations and then subsequently deployed in
hundreds of thousands of systems, these types of assessments can be carried out at a greater
level of depth and provide deeper insights into the security capabilities of the products.
The evidence needed to determine compliance with the security requirements is obtained by
assessing the implementation of the safeguards and countermeasures selected to satisfy the
requirements. Assessors can build on previously developed materials that started with the
specification of the information security needs of the organization and were further improved
during the design, development, and implementation of the system. These materials provide
the initial evidence for an assurance case.
Assessments can be conducted by system developers, system integrators, auditors, system
owners, or the security staffs of organizations. The assessors or assessment teams bring
available information about the system together, such as the results of component product
assessments. The assessors can conduct additional system-level assessments using the
assessment methods and procedures contained in this publication and the implementation
information provided by the nonfederal organization in its system security plan. Assessments
can be used to compile and evaluate the evidence needed by organizations to help determine
the effectiveness of the safeguards implemented to protect CUI, the actions needed to mitigate
security risks to the organization, and compliance with the security requirements.
The assessment procedures in this publication are based on and sourced to the assessment
procedures in SP 800-53A [5]. For additional information and guidance on preparing for
security assessments, developing assessment plans, conducting assessments, and analyzing
assessment report results, consult SP 800-53A [5]. 
3. The Procedures
This section provides assessment procedures for the security requirements defined in NIST SP
800-171 [3]. Organizations that conduct security requirement assessments can develop their
security assessment plans by using the information provided in the assessment procedures and
selecting the specific assessment methods and objects that meet the organization's needs.
Organizations also have flexibility in defining the level of rigor and detail associated with the
assessment based on the assurance requirements of the organization.
