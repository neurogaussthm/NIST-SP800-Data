User: A developer accidentally committed credentials into a code repository. How should our incident response process (SP 800-61) handle this type of internal data exposure incident?\nAssistant: SP 800-61's principles apply here. The response would involve Detection (identifying the exposure), Containment (revoking the compromised credentials immediately, removing them from the repository history if possible), Eradication (ensuring no further exposure), and Recovery (issuing new credentials, validating no misuse occurred).

Can you clarify based on NIST's descriptions?\nAssistant: As described in SP 800-207, the Policy Engine (which contains the PDP) makes the access decision based on enterprise policy and various inputs (like identity, device health via PIPs). The Policy Administrator configures the engine. The Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) is responsible for actually enabling, monitoring, and terminating connections based on the decisions from the Policy Engine.\nUser: So the PEP is like the security guard, and the PDP/Engine is the brain making the decision?\nAssistant:
