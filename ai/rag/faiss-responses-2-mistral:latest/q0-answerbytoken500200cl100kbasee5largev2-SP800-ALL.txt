How does NIST SP 800-61 relate to NIST SP 800-137 in terms of continuous monitoring and incident response?

4.2177036930806935

 NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-61, "Computer Security Incident Response Guide," and SP 800-137, "Continuous Monitoring for Critical Infrastructure," are two separate publications from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

SP 800-61 provides guidance on incident response, which is the process of handling and managing computer security incidents to minimize damage, recover lost data, and restore normal operations. It outlines various roles, responsibilities, and recommended practices for an effective incident response plan.

On the other hand, SP 800-137 focuses on continuous monitoring in critical infrastructure. Continuous monitoring is the ongoing evaluation of system security posture to manage risk and protect assets by automating the process for identifying and responding to cybersecurity attacks or unusual activity. It includes activities such as event selection, normalization, correlation, analysis, and reporting.

In terms of relationship between the two publications, SP 800-137 provides a foundation for continuous monitoring, which can help in detecting and mitigating security incidents more quickly. This early detection is crucial for an effective incident response as outlined in SP 800-61, allowing organizations to respond rapidly and minimize damage or loss.

In summary, while both publications address cybersecurity within organizations, SP 800-61 focuses on incident response, and SP 800-137 focuses on continuous monitoring, which can support effective incident response by providing timely information about potential security incidents.

What role does asset management play in both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37

4.577081880066544

 Asset management plays a crucial role in both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37. In SP 800-171, the Protection of Information at Information System Providers (Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations), asset management is addressed under several security requirements:

   - **System Component Inventory**: Develop and document an inventory of system components, review and update it regularly, and update it as part of installations, removals, and system updates.
   - **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Asset Identification**: Identify CUI assets within the organization and ensure their protection.
   - **Supply Chain Requirements and Processes**: Establish a process for identifying and addressing weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes, including hardware, software, firmware, and systems development processes.

In SP 800-37, the Guidelines for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems (RMF), asset management is a fundamental part of the Risk Assessment process:

   - **Identify Authorized Systems and Categories of Information**: Identify all authorized systems and the types of information they handle. This includes hardware, software, firmware, and other assets that store or process information.
   - **Categorize Information and Associated Systems**: Based on the potential impact to organizational operations if the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information were compromised, each information system is categorized.

By effectively managing their assets, organizations can better protect their sensitive information and comply with federal regulations.

# Procedural/Sequential questions


What are the steps in the risk assessment process dexcribed in SP 800-30?

4.36651213793084

1. Preparing for Risk Assessments (Task 1):
    - Identify the purpose of the risk assessment.
    - Identify the scope of the risk assessment.
    - Identify assumptions and constraints.
    - Identify sources of threat, vulnerability, and impact information.
    - Define or refine the risk model, assessment approach, and analysis approach.

2. Conducting the Risk Assessment (Task 2):
    - Evaluate threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts using the defined risk model and analytic approaches.
    - Calculate and document the semi-quantitative risk values for each identified risk.

3. Documenting and Reporting the Results (Task 3):
    - Compile the results of the risk assessment in a formal report.
    - Provide recommendations for risk mitigation or acceptance based on organizational risk tolerance.

4. Reviewing and Approving the Risk Assessment Report (Task 4):
    - Organizational reviewers verify that the report is complete, accurate, and consistent with the risk management strategy.
    - The risk executive (function) reviews, approves, or rejects the report. If approved, the report becomes the basis for making risk-informed decisions regarding security controls.

5. Updating Risk Assessments (Task 5):
    - Regularly update risk assessments to reflect changes in threat sources, vulnerabilities, and the organization's risk management strategy. This helps ensure that decisions remain informed by current risks.

Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.

3.9924072129651904

 The Risk Management Framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37 consists of the following phases:

1. Preparation for RMF Execution: This phase includes activities that prepare the organization for executing the RMF. These activities involve assigning roles and responsibilities, establishing a risk management strategy, identifying assets, understanding threats, conducting risk assessments, identifying and prioritizing security and privacy requirements, and more.

2. Level 1 – Organization-wide Risk Management: This level involves managing security and privacy risk at the organizational level. It includes activities such as setting strategic vision and top-level goals and objectives, planning for project execution, and considering factors like modernization initiatives, enterprise architecture, and resource allocation.

3. Level 2 – Mission/Business Process Risk Management: This level addresses risk from a mission/business process perspective. It is guided and informed by the risk decisions made at the organizational level and can impact the selection and implementation of controls at the system level.

4. Level 3 – Information System Risk Management: This level focuses on managing security and privacy risk from an information system perspective. The risk decisions made at the organization and mission/business process levels can impact the selection and implementation of controls at this level.

Each level has bi-directional communication and reporting to ensure that risk is addressed throughout the organization.

# Policy interpretation/Coneceptual paraphrasing


How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?

5.05261776316911

 The principle of least privilege (PoLP) is a fundamental cybersecurity concept that suggests that in any given computing task or process, an entity should be granted the minimum level of access necessary to complete the required job function. PoLP is crucial for maintaining security because it helps limit potential damage from hackers, insiders, and other threats by reducing the attack surface and minimizing the amount of sensitive data that can be accessed. This concept applies to users, processes, and services alike, ensuring that each entity has only the permissions required to perform their intended function without any unnecessary access or privileges.

Here is a summary of some related controls that are mentioned in the text:

1. (1) Least Privilege | Restricting Privileged Accounts on Systems: This control involves restricting privileged accounts, such as super user accounts, to specific personnel or roles, preventing day-to-day users from accessing sensitive information or functions.
2. (6) Least Privilege | Privileged Access by Non-Organizational Users: This control prohibits privileged access to the system by non-organizational users (i.e., individuals who are not employees or authorized contractors).
3. (7) Least Privilege | Review of User Privileges: Periodically review assigned user privileges to ensure they remain necessary and valid, and make adjustments as needed based on organizational mission, business needs, or other factors.
4. (8) Least Privilege | Privilege Levels for Code Execution: This control ensures that certain software does not execute at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.
5. AC-06 Least Privilege: This is the main assessment objective to determine if the principle of least privilege is employed and only authorized accesses are granted to users or processes acting on behalf of users for assigned organizational tasks.

These controls aim to minimize security risks by limiting user privileges, restricting access to sensitive information, and ensuring that entities only have the permissions needed to complete their intended functions effectively while maintaining proper security postures.

Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.

3.1560542159713805

 The purpose of security categorization, according to NIST, is to define the level of protection required for an information system based on its impact on organizational operations, assets, or individuals. This process determines the potential impact if the system were to be compromised, which helps in selecting an initial set of security controls and tailoring them as appropriate, implementing these controls, assessing their effectiveness, authorizing system operation when acceptable risk is determined, monitoring and maintaining the security status, and reporting on the security posture of the system. Security categorization plays a crucial role in the NIST Risk Management Framework as it provides input into each step following it.

# Rare or niche topics


What does SP 800-160 say about systems engineering principles for secure design?

4.775813322048634

 According to SP 800-160 Vol. 1, the Systems Security Engineering – Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems, the guidance provides considerations for systems engineering principles that support secure design. The document emphasizes protection against asset loss and includes systems engineering processes to align concepts, frameworks, and analytic processes from multiple disciplines, allowing trade-offs within and between different aspects of trustworthiness applicable to a system of interest.

For example, the principles presented in SP 800-160 Vol. 1 include:

* Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Implementing PoLP means that users are granted the least amount of access necessary to perform their job functions and no more. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access or activities by minimizing the number of privileged accounts in a system.

* Defense in Depth (DID): DID is a strategy that uses multiple layers of security mechanisms to protect against potential attacks or breaches. Each layer provides additional protection and makes it more difficult for an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

* Principle of Least Astonishment (PoLA): PoLA means that the behavior of a system should be consistent with the user's expectations, based on their understanding of how the system is intended to work. This helps users make informed decisions and reduces the risk of unintended consequences or human error.

* Principle of Psychological Acceptability (PoPA): PoPA means that the security mechanisms implemented in a system should be user-friendly, intuitive, and easy to use, minimizing the likelihood of user confusion or mistakes.

These principles can help engineers design systems that are more secure by considering various aspects of trustworthiness, such as security, reliability, safety, and resilience.

What guidance is given on quantum-resistant cryptography in SP 800-208?

# Misleading or contradictory phrasing


Is continuous monitoring a step in the risk assessment process according to SP 800-30?

2.6334386067464948

 No, continuous monitoring is not a step in the risk assessment process according to SP 800-30. However, it is a crucial activity for maintaining the currency of risk assessments and ensuring ongoing situational awareness of the organizational governance structures, mission/business processes, information systems, and environments of operation. Changes in these risk factors can be used to refresh risk assessments as needed.

Does SP 800-171 recommend two-factor authentication for all users?

2.989802610129118

 No, SP 800-171 does not explicitly state that two-factor authentication should be implemented for all users. However, it does recommend the implementation of multi-factor authentication for access to privileged and non-privileged accounts (SP 800-171, section 03.05.03). The choice of which factors to use depends on the organization's specific security requirements and risk management approach.
