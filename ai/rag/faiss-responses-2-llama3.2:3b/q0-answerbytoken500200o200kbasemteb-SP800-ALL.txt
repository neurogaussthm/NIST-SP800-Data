# Procedural/Sequential questions


What are the steps in the risk assessment process dexcribed in SP 800-30?

2.9674474033527076

The steps in the risk assessment process described in SP 800-30 include:

1. **Preparing for the Assessment**: This step involves identifying the purpose of the risk assessment, defining or refining the risk model, assessment approach, and analysis approach to be used, gathering threat and vulnerability information, and establishing an assessment context.
2. **Conducting the Risk Assessment**: This step involves analyzing threats and vulnerabilities, impacts and likelihood, and uncertainty associated with the risk assessment process. It also includes gathering essential information as part of each task.

These steps are part of a three-tiered risk management hierarchy:

1. **Tier 1** (Organization Level): Evaluates systemic information security-related risks associated with organizational governance and management activities.
2. **Tier 2** (Mission/Business Process Level): Evaluates the security risks associated with specific missions, business processes, or enterprise architectures.
3. **Tier 3** (Information System Level): Evaluates the security risks associated with individual information systems.

The risk assessment process is designed to provide senior leaders/executives with the information needed to determine appropriate courses of action in response to identified risks.

Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.

3.2648831959813833

The Risk Management Framework (RMF) consists of seven steps: Prepare, Authorize, Acquire, Implement, Sustain, Maintain, and Monitor. The phases are:

1. **Prepare**: This is the preparatory phase where organizations ensure they have the necessary resources and capabilities to execute the RMF.
2. **Authorize**: In this phase, organizations determine that the risk to organizational operations and assets is acceptable and authorize the system or common controls.
3. **Acquire**: The acquire phase involves obtaining the necessary hardware, software, and services to support the system or common control.
4. **Implement**: During the implement phase, organizations put the acquired resources into use, ensuring proper configuration, deployment, and testing of the system or common control.
5. **Sustain**: In the sustain phase, organizations maintain the ongoing operation, management, and maintenance of the system or common control to ensure continued security and privacy posture.
6. **Maintain**: The maintain phase involves periodic reviews and updates to the RMF process, ensuring that it remains effective and efficient in managing security and privacy risks.
7. **Monitor**: Finally, in the monitor phase, organizations continuously assess and report on the security and privacy posture of the system or common control to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable requirements.

These phases are not necessarily sequential, and there is flexibility in how each step can be executed, as long as the required tasks are completed and risk management objectives are achieved.

# Policy interpretation/Coneceptual paraphrasing


How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?

3.0431242478080094

According to NIST, "Least Privilege" refers to the principle of allocating a user, process, or system component only those privileges necessary for its specified functions. This means that the system or component has access to only the resources and capabilities required to perform its intended tasks, without additional or excessive privileges.

The term "least privilege" is important because it helps minimize the risk of security breaches by:

1. Reducing the attack surface: By limiting the privileges granted to a user, process, or system component, an attacker would need to exploit multiple vulnerabilities to achieve their goal.
2. Simplifying security analysis: With least privilege, the security analysis of a component is simplified, as it only needs to consider the specific privileges required for its functions.
3. Reducing damage in case of failure: If a system or component fails due to a security breach, the impact is minimized because the compromised user or process has only been granted necessary privileges.

In summary, NIST's definition of "least privilege" emphasizes the importance of allocating only the necessary privileges to users, processes, and system components, thereby reducing the risk of security breaches and simplifying security analysis.

Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.

3.2738645300269127

Security categorization is a process used by federal agencies to identify, evaluate, and prioritize the security risks associated with their information systems and data. The purpose of security categorization is to ensure that each information type or system receives the appropriate management oversight and reflects the needs of the organization as a whole.

According to NIST SP 800-60, security categorization is an essential function that must be conducted in a manner that reduces the risks to the information entrusted to the agency, its overall mission, and its ability to do business and serve the American public. The process involves identifying all applicable information types, establishing security impact levels for loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information types, and assigning a security categorization.

The four-step security categorization process is as follows:

1. Identify Information Types: Agencies identify all applicable information types that are representative of input, stored, processed, and/or output data from each system.
2. Establish Security Impact Levels: Agencies establish security impact levels for loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information types based on the potential harm or consequences of unauthorized access or disclosure of the information.
3. Assign Security Categorization: Agencies assign a security categorization (unclassified, confidential, secret, top secret) to each information type or system based on its assigned security impact level.
4. Select Baseline Security Controls: The assigned security categorization drives the selection of baseline security controls for the information system.

The overall purpose of security categorization is to ensure that agencies manage risk effectively and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information resources.

# Misleading or contradictory phrasing


Is continuous monitoring a step in the risk assessment process according to SP 800-30?

2.764318064786494

Yes, continuous monitoring is considered an ongoing activity that complements and supports the risk assessment process. According to Special Publication 800-30, organizations should identify key risk factors for ongoing monitoring and conduct continuous monitoring activities to determine whether risks have increased to unacceptable levels (i.e., exceeding organizational risk tolerance).

The guidance states: "Organizations employ risk assessments on an ongoing basis throughout the system development life cycle and across all of the tiers in the risk management hierarchy—with the frequency of the risk assessments and the resources applied during the assessments, commensurate with the expressly defined purpose and scope of the assessments."

This means that continuous monitoring is an integral part of the risk assessment process, allowing organizations to update their risk assessments as needed and ensure that they are taking appropriate courses of action in response to identified risks.

Does SP 800-171 recommend two-factor authentication for all users?
