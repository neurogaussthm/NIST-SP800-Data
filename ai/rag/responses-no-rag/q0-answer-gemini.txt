# Direct fact recall

What is the primary purpose of NIST SP 800-53?
The primary purpose of NIST SP 800-53 is to provide a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations to help them manage risk.

According to SP 800-30, what is the definition of 'risk'?
According to NIST SP 800-30, risk is "a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence."

Which publication provides guidance on incident response planning?
NIST Special Publication 800-61, "Computer Security Incident Handling Guide," provides guidance on incident response planning.

# Chunk reasoning

How does NIST SP 800-61 relate to NIST SP 800-137 in terms of continuous monitoring and incident response?
NIST SP 800-137, "Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information Systems and Organizations," provides guidance on establishing and maintaining continuous monitoring programs. SP 800-61, "Computer Security Incident Handling Guide," relies on the data produced by continuous monitoring to identify and respond to security incidents. Thus, SP 800-137 provides the data foundation that enables effective incident response as outlined in SP 800-61.

What role does asset management play in both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37?
In NIST SP 800-171, "Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations," asset management is crucial for identifying and protecting the CUI. Knowing what assets hold CUI is essential for applying appropriate security controls. In NIST SP 800-37, "Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy," asset management is a foundational activity for risk assessment. Identifying and categorizing assets is necessary for determining the potential impacts and vulnerabilities associated with them.

# Procedural/Sequential questions

What are the steps in the risk assessment process described in SP 800-30?
The steps in the risk assessment process described in NIST SP 800-30 include:
1.  **Prepare for assessment:** Defining the scope, purpose, assumptions, and constraints of the risk assessment.
2.  **Conduct the assessment:**
    * Identifying threats.
    * Identifying vulnerabilities.
    * Determining the likelihood of threat occurrence.
    * Determining the impact of threat occurrence.
    * Determining the risk.
3.  **Communicate results:** Sharing the risk assessment findings with relevant stakeholders.
4.  **Maintain the assessment:** Periodically reviewing and updating the risk assessment.

Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.
The phases of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as per NIST SP 800-37 are:
1.  **Categorize:** Categorize the information system and information processed, stored, and transmitted by that system based on the impact of loss.
2.  **Select:** Select an initial set of applicable security controls based on the security categorization.
3.  **Implement:** Implement the security controls and document how the controls are deployed within the system and operating environment.
4.  **Assess:** Assess the security controls to determine if the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements.
5.  **Authorize:** Authorize system operation based on a determination of the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
6.  **Monitor:** Monitor the security controls on an ongoing basis to determine if the controls continue to be effective.

# Policy interpretation/Coneceptual paraphrasing

How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?
NIST defines "least privilege" as the principle that users and processes should be granted only the minimum access rights necessary to perform their authorized tasks. It is important because it limits the potential damage from accidental or malicious actions by restricting the scope of access.

Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.
The purpose of security categorization, according to NIST, is to determine the potential impact of the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems. This categorization helps organizations select appropriate security controls to protect their assets based on the level of risk.

# Rare or niche topics

What does SP 800-160 say about systems engineering principles for secure design?
NIST SP 800-160, "Systems Security Engineering: Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems," provides guidance on integrating security engineering principles into the system development life cycle. It emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach, considering security from the initial stages of design, and stresses the importance of understanding the system's context and potential threats.

What guidance is given on quantum-resistant cryptography in SP 800-208?
NIST SP 800-208, "Recommendation for Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes," addresses the standardization of hash-based digital signature schemes, which are considered a form of quantum-resistant cryptography. It provides guidance on the use and implementation of these schemes as a potential alternative to traditional public-key cryptography in a post-quantum computing environment.

# Misleading or contradictory phrasing

Is continuous monitoring a step in the risk assessment process according to SP 800-30?
No, continuous monitoring is not a step in the initial risk assessment process according to SP 800-30. Continuous monitoring occurs after the risk assessment, during the "monitor" phase of the RMF from SP 800-37.

Does SP 800-171 recommend two-factor authentication for all users?
NIST SP 800-171 requires multifactor authentication (MFA) for users accessing systems containing Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). While two-factor authentication is a form of MFA, the standard does not specifically state that it must be two-factor, simply that it must be multi. Also, the standard is for systems that contain CUI, not all users.

# Out of scope/control

What is the difference between ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53?
ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS), providing a framework for managing information security risks. NIST SP 800-53 is a U.S. federal government publication that provides a catalog of security and privacy controls. ISO 27001 is a standard for an ISMS, where NIST SP 800-53 is a catalog of controls that can be used within an ISMS.

Who was the original author of SP 800-53?
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is the author of SP 800-53. It is a collaborative effort by various experts and contributors within NIST.
