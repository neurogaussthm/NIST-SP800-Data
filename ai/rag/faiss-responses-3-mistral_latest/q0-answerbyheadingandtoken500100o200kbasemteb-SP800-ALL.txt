According to SP 800-30, what is the definition of 'risk'?

3.7930785757489502

 In accordance with SP 800-30, risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and it is typically a function of the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs and the likelihood of occurrence. Risk assessment involves identifying, estimating, and prioritizing information security risks by analyzing threat and vulnerability information to determine how circumstances or events could adversely impact an organization and the likelihood that such circumstances or events will occur. The adverse impacts can be represented as a single value or as a vector (i.e., multiple values), grouped according to the types of adverse impacts and possibly the time frames in which those impacts are likely to be experienced.

What role does asset management play in both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37

4.347091406118125

 In both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37, Asset Management plays a crucial role. Asset Management is a fundamental practice that involves identifying, classifying, protecting, and controlling information and information systems.

In **SP 800-171**, Asset Management is indirectly addressed under the Access Control (AC) family of security requirements. Specifically, AC-3: Label Information requires labeling information according to its sensitivity so that it can be protected appropriately. To effectively implement this requirement, understanding the value and sensitivity of assets is essential.

In **SP 800-37**, Asset Management is directly addressed as one of the fundamental security control categories (FSC). Specifically, the controls within the Asset Management FSC cover the processes for identifying organizational assets, determining their value, assessing the risk to those assets, and protecting them accordingly. The Asset Management FSC includes controls like Controlled Use of Mobile Devices, Media Sanitation, and Configuration Management.

# Procedural/Sequential questions


What are the steps in the risk assessment process dexcribed in SP 800-30?

4.3877809648402035

 The risk assessment process described in SP 800-30 includes four main steps:

1. Prepare for the assessment: This step involves defining the scope, objectives, and methodology of the risk assessment, as well as establishing the assessment team and gathering necessary information.
2. Conduct the assessment: In this step, the team analyzes threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, likelihood, and uncertainty to produce a list of prioritized information security risks. This step includes various tasks such as identifying specific risk factors to monitor, assessing the entire threat space, and gathering essential information for each task.
3. Communicate assessment results: After the assessment is completed, the results are communicated to relevant organizational personnel. This step may also involve sharing risk-related information with other parties as needed.
4. Maintain the assessment: The final step involves maintaining the results of the risk assessment on an ongoing basis, including updating the assessment to reflect changes in the system or organization and monitoring identified risks to determine if they have increased to unacceptable levels.

Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.

4.62438723212108

 The Risk Management Framework (RMF) as per NIST SP 800-37, Revision 2 consists of four main phases: Prepare, Categorize, Select and Implement, and Assess.

1. Prepare: This phase prepares the organization to execute the RMF effectively. It includes activities like defining organizational roles and responsibilities for risk management, identifying system owners, developing a security awareness program, and defining risk management procedures.

2. Categorize: In this phase, the information system and the information that it processes, stores, or transmits is categorized based on its impact levels. The information categories include confidentiality, integrity, and availability, each with five possible levels (Low, Moderate, High, Mission Critical, and Not Applicable).

3. Select and Implement: This phase involves selecting appropriate safeguards to protect the information and assessing their effectiveness. Safeguard functions can be administrative, technical, or physical in nature. The selected safeguards are then implemented according to their specified implementation guidelines.

4. Assess: The final phase of RMF is the assessment phase, where the effectiveness of the implemented safeguards is continuously evaluated. This includes conducting periodic authorization reviews and risk reassessment to ensure that the system remains protected at an acceptable level throughout its life cycle.

# Policy interpretation/Coneceptual paraphrasing


How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?

4.213745188899338

 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines 'least privilege' as a principle where each system component is allocated only the necessary privileges to perform its specified functions, and no more. This means that components are not given any additional access or permissions beyond what they need to do their intended tasks.

The importance of least privilege lies in two key benefits: firstly, by limiting the scope of a component's actions, the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse is minimized. Secondly, applying the principle simplifies the security analysis of each component within the system design, making it easier to maintain and secure the overall system.

Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.

4.514726612716913

 The purpose of security categorization, as outlined in the NIST SP800-60 Vol. 1 Rev. 1 document, is to establish the foundation for the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) activity by determining the levels of rigor required for certifying and testing the security controls. This process helps in integrating security into a government agency's business and information technology management functions and aids in establishing standardization amongst their information systems. It also assists in determining the level of effort and associated activity duration for C&A, as well as identifying any additional activities that may be needed, such as privacy or Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). The process begins with identifying what information supports which government lines of business, defined by the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA), followed by an evaluation of the need for security in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This strong linkage between missions, information, and information systems results in cost-effective information security. Furthermore, the security categorization process provides input into the approval of security categorization for the system, as detailed in NIST SP800-37 Rev. 2.
