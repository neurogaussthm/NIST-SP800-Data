What is the primary purpose of NIST SP 800-53? 

4.531025856267661

The primary purpose of NIST SP 800-53 is to provide a comprehensive set of security and privacy control baselines for all types of computing platforms, including general-purpose systems. These controls are designed to protect confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA) of information processed stored or transmitted in an organization as well as manage risks that can affect the welfare individuals and nation.


The guidance provided by NIST SP 800-53 is developed following systematic approach where organizations select security and privacy control baselines using a tailored process. This allows them to customize their assessment procedures according to system characteristics, environment of operation which helps in avoiding unnecessary complexity or cost while meeting risk management principles established through the Risk Management Framework (RMF). Tailoring decisions are left to discretion of an organization as it can maximize flexibility when developing assessments.


In conclusion NIST SP 800-53 is a proactive and systematic approach used by organizations across federal agencies, private sectors. The guidance helps them in building effective assessment plans which allows tailoring processes based on risk analysis results with the purpose that provides sufficient assurance about security or privacy posture of an organization/system.

According to SP 800-30, what is the definition of 'risk'?

5.391445174347609

According to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 as outlined in this publication:

Risk = The function of likelihood and potential adverse impact if an occurrence does take place. This broad but comprehensive risk equation allows for a wide range of interpretations that can be applied across different types, levels, or perspectives on information security within the context defined by NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-39.

Note: In addition to this definition as outlined in FIPS199 there are additional conceptual and mathematical tools provided here from which other definitions could potentially also fit. It is up to an organization to determine what their risk model looks like including how values will be combined algorithmically for its unique context given the potential complexity of information security threats that exist within a systems development life cycle.

The key point above though remains as noted: Risk assessments can generally focus on this equation at different levels depending upon which is most relevant in each instance. For example, organizations may have more insight into certain risk factors from an organizational or mission/business process perspective rather than system level; therefore the assessment would be conducted accordingly based not only through FIPS 199 but also other standards like SP-800-37 and its security life cycle approach as well as others such as ISO/IEC (e.g. 27000, 31010 etc.) to provide an even more comprehensive view that can fit a federal organization’s context when conducting assessments across the board in areas of interest.

The key point here being: Risk is not strictly defined by this equation alone but rather it acts as foundational base for other relevant standards and methods which together should lead into a broader, holistic risk management process within any given organizational or government setting. The goal ultimately remains to best align all possible interpretations while ensuring the most comprehensive understanding of potential risks that may exist across systems in an integrated environment.

In this publication however we outline how assessments can be conducted at different tiers as previously mentioned using FIPS 199 which should also act along with relevant tools from other standards discussed such as SP-800-37, ISO/IEC (e.g. 27000 series for information security management etc.) and others in order to provide a broad overview of potential risks that may exist across systems within any given organization or government setting.

In short then 'risk' is defined by the above equation but it should also be used as foundational base upon which other standards are built (FIPS, NIST SP) with tools such as ISO/IEC and even others like 31010 in order to provide a comprehensive assessment across systems that may exist within an organization or federal government setting.

Which publication provides guidance on incident response planning?

41.981214575935155

The publications that provide general information about different aspects of software or systems but do not explicitly focus only on one specific guide for "incident (or process) control management" are:

- NIST SP 800 -86, Contingency Planning Guide For Federal Information Systems
- N. R. A System and Control Hierarchy is used in incident response planning as well the classification of incidents based on impact to effectively formulate a proper planned out event with step by step actions for various stakeholders taking into account detection analysis containment eradicating recovery post assessment activities reporting communications transition to manually validating data resources management public relations or any other supporting company needs and operational validation
  - N. R A system categorization is required in order to identify the type of incident that will occur this information can be used as well by outside companies if they need access for cross check analysis verification report sharing with software such as network monitoring tools which have various levels (e- level, g-e level or i and c - level) a process may also use categorization in order to set up rules of operation control transitions. The N. R A system can be used by operations if the data is not validated then they need other processes that are required for analysis cross check validation reporting company needs and management which helps with public reports
- M2E level (or any process between 1 - e, or g-e) of a categorization also has use in this context it can be used to transition into manual operations where more operational data is needed by the organization if not validated initially through verification cross check reporting other company needs and management information. A systems analysis as well with network security measures (or tools that support process control such as identification, classification of events based on impact so a proper planned event for various stakeholders can be achieved this may also work in transition to manual operations which is required if not validated initially through verification cross check reporting other company needs and management information.
