According to SP 800-30, what is the definition of 'risk'?

3.4488784801214933

 According to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-30, "risk" is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and it is typically a function of the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs, and the likelihood of occurrence. In this context, risk assessment involves identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks related to information security, focusing on losses of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems that could impact organizational operations, assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

Which publication provides guidance on incident response planning?

3.115882328012958

 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications that provide guidance on incident response planning include SP800-53A, specifically the section related to the organizational incident response plan and related organizational processes, and SP800-82. Additionally, SP800-171A discusses the development of an incident response plan, particularly in addressing the sharing of incident information.

# Chunk reasoning


How does NIST SP 800-61 relate to NIST SP 800-137 in terms of continuous monitoring and incident response?

4.216203724965453

 NIST SP 800-61 focuses on the incident response process, providing guidelines for establishing an incident response capability, creating policies and plans, developing procedures, and sharing information about incidents. On the other hand, NIST SP 800-137 deals with continuous monitoring of National Security Systems (NSS) and Critical Infrastructure (CI).

While both documents share the common goal of enhancing the security posture of systems, they address different aspects. NIST SP 800-61 emphasizes incident response, which is a reactive measure, whereas NIST SP 800-137 focuses on continuous monitoring and real-time threat detection and response, which can be considered proactive measures aimed at minimizing or preventing incidents in the first place.

In essence, you could say that NIST SP 800-61 is more about what to do when an incident occurs, while NIST SP 800-137 provides guidance on maintaining a high level of security to reduce the likelihood and impact of incidents through continuous monitoring and effective response capabilities.

What role does asset management play in both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37

4.704651423031464

 In NIST SP 800-171, Asset Management (AM) is a part of the Access Control (AC) family. Specifically, Requirement AU-4, which pertains to managing information system-related assets, falls under this family. This requirement includes activities such as:
   - Categorizing and identifying organizational information systems (IS) and their components.
   - Safeguarding IS and associated resources.
   - Inventorying software and firmware on organizational IS.
   - Protecting the integrity of software, operating system images, firmware, and information during execution or use.

   On the other hand, in NIST SP 800-37 (R4) Risk Assessment, Asset Management plays a crucial role in the entire risk assessment process. The document defines Asset Management as the "process of identifying, categorizing, valuing, and maintaining software, information technology systems, facilities, and other resources to ensure that they remain available for their intended use." This includes activities like inventorying hardware and software assets, assessing their value, and determining their impact in case of a security incident or compromise.

In summary, Asset Management is an important function in both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37. However, its role differs slightly between the two documents - in SP 800-171, it falls under Access Control (AU-4), while in SP 800-37, it is a crucial part of the Risk Assessment process.

# Procedural/Sequential questions


What are the steps in the risk assessment process dexcribed in SP 800-30?

3.8408154619392008

 The risk assessment process described in SP 800-30 includes four main steps:

1. Prepare for the assessment: This involves defining the scope, objectives, and context of the assessment, identifying stakeholders, and gathering information about the system or organization being assessed.

2. Conduct the assessment: In this step, organizations analyze threats and vulnerabilities, impacts and likelihood, and the uncertainty associated with the risk assessment process to produce a list of prioritized information security risks.

3. Communicate assessment results: This involves sharing the findings of the risk assessment with key organizational personnel so they can make informed decisions about risk response strategies.

4. Maintain the assessment: It's important to keep risk assessments up-to-date and relevant by regularly reviewing and updating them based on changes in the system or organization being assessed.

Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.

4.520612115971744

 The Risk Management Framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37 consists of the following four main phases:

1. Prepare: This phase involves preparing the organization to execute the RMF effectively and efficiently. It includes tasks like defining organizational roles and responsibilities, selecting risk management methods and tools, and determining the system's operational and mission requirements.

2. Categorize: In this phase, the data, systems, and functions are categorized based on their impact to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, and other organizations. This helps in understanding the potential impact of a security or privacy incident.

3. Select: The third phase involves selecting the appropriate safeguards to protect against identified risks. It includes tasks like identifying federal information system and organization safeguards, implementing those safeguards, and verifying their effectiveness.

4. Implement: This phase is about executing the plan and implementing the selected security controls. It includes activities like deploying and configuring systems, installing software, and conducting risk management activities throughout the system development life cycle (SDLC).

5. Assess: The final phase of the RMF involves continuous monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of implemented safeguards to manage risks over time. This includes tasks like reviewing security authorization documents, performing ongoing risk assessment, and continuously monitoring and authorizing information systems and organizational operations.

# Policy interpretation/Coneceptual paraphrasing


How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?

4.649248932022601

 According to the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5, the term 'least privilege' refers to a principle where each system component is allocated sufficient privileges only to accomplish its specified functions but no more. It's essential because applying this principle limits the scope of a system component's actions in two ways:

  1. The security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the system component will have a minimized security impact. This means that if a vulnerability is exploited, the potential damage to the system is reduced due to the limited privileges granted to the affected component.

  2. The security analysis of the component becomes simpler because fewer privileges and actions are involved. This makes it easier for system administrators to understand and manage the security of each component, reducing the overall risk to the entire system.

In other words, by using the principle of least privilege, organizations can minimize potential damage from security threats and make their systems more secure overall. This is achieved by limiting what each component can do within the system and restricting access to sensitive areas or functions.

For additional information on this topic, you might find it helpful to explore the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 document in greater detail, as I've referenced several times in my response. You can also look into NIST SP 800-171 Revision 3 for more guidance on implementing the principle of least privilege in specific situations.

Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.

5.016737300902605

 Security Categorization, as outlined in the NIST SP 800-60 (Revision 1), serves a few crucial purposes within the context of cybersecurity policy for federal information systems:

1. It sets the foundation for the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) process by determining the levels of rigor required for security control certification, assurance testing, and additional activities such as privacy and Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). This helps in managing the level of effort and associated duration of C&A activities.

2. It integrates security into a government agency's business and information technology management functions. By establishing a foundation for security standardization amongst their information systems, it ensures that there is a strong linkage between missions, information, and information systems, resulting in cost-effective information security.

3. Security categorization helps identify what information supports which government lines of business, as defined by the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA). This process evaluates the need for security based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability considerations.

4. Approval of security categorization for a system is a necessary step in the overall C&A process, according to NIST SP 800-37 (Revision 2).

It's important to note that this process should be revisited at least every three years or when significant change occurs to the system or supporting business lines. Additionally, situational changes outside the system or agency may require a reevaluation of the categorization due to factors like directed mission changes, changes in governance, or elevated or targeted threat activities.

# Rare or niche topics


What does SP 800-160 say about systems engineering principles for secure design?

3.9750136490911245

 SP 800-160, specifically Volume 1, provides guidance on systems security engineering with an emphasis on protection against asset loss. The publication emphasizes that security is embedded in systems, and it encourages the design of a single system with security embedded in the system and its components.

In addition, it suggests that other aspects of trustworthiness such as reliability, safety, and resilience should also be considered. The cyber resiliency design principles are aligned with and can be derived from design principles for security, resilience engineering, or both. A complete list of strategic and structural cyber resiliency design principles is provided in Appendix D.

For more detailed information, you may refer to the documents SP800-160 Vol. 1 Rev. 1, which can be found here: <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-160v1.pdf>

What guidance is given on quantum-resistant cryptography in SP 800-208?

3.988539580022916

 The document SP 800-208 does not explicitly provide guidance on quantum-resistant cryptography. However, the concept of post-quantum cryptography is mentioned in SP 800-77 Rev. 1, where it's suggested that an adversary with a quantum computer may be able to reduce the key strength of an AES key by a factor of two, implying the need for quantum-resistant algorithms in the future. To find guidance on post-quantum cryptography, you might want to look at documents such as SP 800-209 (Revision 1), "Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization: A Progress Report" and SP 800-209A, "NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process: Revised Timeline and Plan."

This is stated in section A.03.05.03[02] of SP800-171A Rev. 3. However, the exact number of factors used may vary depending on the specific implementation.

# Out of scope/control


What is the difference between ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53?

4.2519405980128795

 ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53 are both cybersecurity frameworks, but they have some key differences.

ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. The standard includes requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an ISMS. It also specifies a number of controls to help organizations meet these requirements.

On the other hand, NIST SP 800-53 is a U.S. government publication providing recommendations on security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. It provides guidance for tailoring control baselines and developing overlays to support the security and privacy requirements of stakeholders and their organizations. Unlike ISO 27001, SP 800-53 does not provide a framework for establishing an ISMS, but rather offers guidance on implementing specific controls to manage risks to various aspects of systems and organizations.

While both standards share the goal of improving cybersecurity, they have different scopes and approaches. Organizations may choose to implement one, the other, or both, depending on their specific needs and contexts.
