According to SP 800-30, what is the definition of 'risk'?

3.8911878189537674

 Risk, according to Special Publication (SP) 800-30, is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event. It is typically a function of the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs and the likelihood of occurrence. In the context of information security, risks are those that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems and reflect the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations, assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The risk assessment process involves identifying, estimating, and prioritizing these risks by analyzing threat and vulnerability information to determine the extent to which circumstances or events could adversely impact an organization and the likelihood that such circumstances or events will occur.

# Chunk reasoning


How does NIST SP 800-61 relate to NIST SP 800-137 in terms of continuous monitoring and incident response?

4.578248284989968

 NIST SP 800-61 and NIST SP 800-137 both deal with cybersecurity, but they focus on different aspects. NIST SP 800-61 focuses on the incident response process, providing guidance for organizations to prepare for, respond to, and recover from adverse cyber events. It outlines the steps to establish an incident response capability, policy, plan, procedures, and information sharing policies.

   On the other hand, NIST SP 800-137, entitled "Guide for Cyber Threat Information Sharing", emphasizes on continuous monitoring and sharing of cyber threat information. It provides recommendations to facilitate the sharing of actionable cyber threat information among private sector organizations and between the public and private sectors. The goal is to enhance the overall cybersecurity posture and resilience of our nation's infrastructure.

   Although NIST SP 800-61 does not directly discuss continuous monitoring, it stresses the importance of monitoring systems and networks for potential security incidents as part of an effective incident response strategy (as detailed in the "Establish Continuous Monitoring" section within the incident response plan). This continuous monitoring can contribute to the overall goal of proactive cyber threat information sharing, which is addressed in NIST SP 800-137.

What role does asset management play in both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37

4.908370644086972

 In both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37, Asset Management plays a significant role as it forms an essential part of overall cybersecurity.

In **SP 800-171**, Asset Management is not explicitly mentioned in the document you provided, but it's implied through various families such as Access Control (AC), Audit and Accountability (AA), and Configuration Management (CM). These families require organizations to manage their information systems and data effectively, which can be considered a part of Asset Management.

In **SP 800-37**, the role of Asset Management is more direct. The document specifically includes Asset Management as one of its control families. It emphasizes the need for organizations to properly identify, manage, and protect their information systems and the data they contain, as well as associated hardware and software.

# Procedural/Sequential questions


What are the steps in the risk assessment process dexcribed in SP 800-30?

3.248371839057654

 The risk assessment process described in SP 800-30 includes four main steps:

1. Prepare for the assessment
2. Conduct the assessment
3. Communicate assessment results
4. Maintain the assessment

Each step consists of a set of specific tasks. For more detailed information about each task and supplemental guidance, you can refer to Special Publication 800-30 Rev. 1.

Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.

4.592280087061226

 The Risk Management Framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37 consists of four main phases: Prepare, Categorize, Implement, and Assess/Authorize.

1. **Prepare**: This phase is a new addition to the RMF in Revision 2. The goal is to prepare the organization to execute the RMF effectively, efficiently, and cost-effectively. This includes understanding the organizational roles and aligning them with the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) whenever possible.

2. **Categorize**: In this phase, the information system or organization is categorized based on factors such as the type of information being protected, the potential impact of a breach, and the regulatory requirements related to that information. The goal is to determine an appropriate level of protection for the system or organization.

3. **Implement**: Once the system or organization has been categorized, the appropriate security controls are selected, implemented, and configured in the Implement phase. This phase also includes continuous monitoring and adjusting of these controls as necessary.

4. **Assess/Authorize**: In this final phase, the effectiveness of the implemented security controls is assessed to determine if they provide an adequate level of protection for the system or organization. If they do, the system or organization can be authorized for operation. This assessment process should be continuous and repeated as changes occur in the system or organization's environment.

# Policy interpretation/Coneceptual paraphrasing


How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?

3.6346357609145343

 According to the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5, 'least privilege' means that each system component is allocated sufficient privileges to accomplish its specified functions but no more. This principle is crucial because it minimizes the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of a system component and simplifies the security analysis of the component. By limiting the scope of actions for each component, organizations can reduce the attack surface of their systems, making them more secure overall. The NIST SP 800-171 Revision 3 also emphasizes the importance of least privilege in the development, implementation, and operation of a system, suggesting that organizations create additional processes, roles, and system accounts to achieve it.

Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.

4.701420997036621

 According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Security Categorization serves several important purposes within the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) process. The main objective is to establish the levels of rigor required for certification and overall assurance testing of security controls, as well as additional activities such as privacy and critical infrastructure protection (Source document: SP800-60 Vol. 1 Rev. 1).

By determining the necessary level of security based on the information's confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements, it assists in establishing a strong linkage between missions, information, and information systems, ensuring cost-effective information security (Source document: SP800-60 Vol. 1 Rev. 1). Additionally, Security Categorization provides a vital step in integrating security into the government agency's business and information technology management functions and establishing standardization amongst their information systems (Source document: SP800-60 Vol. 1 Rev. 1).

Lastly, the security categorization process documented by NIST provides input for subsequent processes, including the approval of security categorization for the system (Source document: SP800-60 Vol. 1 Rev. 1 and SP800-37 Rev. 2). These processes are essential in maintaining secure federal information systems.

# Rare or niche topics


What does SP 800-160 say about systems engineering principles for secure design?

4.777441465994343

 According to the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-160, Volume 1 [SP 800-160 v1], there are several systems engineering principles for secure design. The publication serves as a reference and educational resource for systems engineers, engineering specialties, architects, designers, and anyone involved in the development of trustworthy secure systems and system components.

   This document emphasizes that security should be embedded within the system itself, rather than being an afterthought or separate from the main design process [Source Document: SP800-160 Vol. 1 Rev. 1]. It also highlights that the cyber resiliency design principles can be aligned with and are based on design principles for security, resilience engineering, or both. A complete list of strategic and structural cyber resiliency design principles is provided in Appendix D of SP800-160 Vol. 2 Rev. 1.

   The specific principles and practices for secure design can be found in various parts of the SP 800-160, but it's important to note that the application of these concepts is meant to be flexible to meet the diverse needs of organizations [Source Document: SP800-160 Vol. 1 Rev. 1]. The concepts and principles for trustworthy secure design are included in Appendices D through F, while the systems life cycle processes and security-relevant activities and tasks can be found in Appendices G through K.

# Out of scope/control


What is the difference between ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53?

4.361118308035657

 ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53 are different standards that offer guidance on information security management systems (ISMS).

ISO 27001 is an internationally recognized standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It provides a framework of best practices to manage information security, including the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and continuous improvement of ISMS. ISO 27001 is a standard that can be certified, meaning an organization can achieve certification against it by undergoing an assessment by an independent, accredited third party.

On the other hand, NIST SP 800-53 focuses specifically on security and privacy control baselines for federal information systems and organizations in the United States. It provides guidance for tailoring control baselines and developing overlays to support the security and privacy requirements of stakeholders and their organizations, and addresses the Select, Assess, and Monitor steps of the Risk Management Framework (RMF). Unlike ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53 is not a certification standard.

In summary, while both standards share similar goals in promoting information security, they differ in their scope, applicability, and format (certification vs. guidance document).

Who was the original author of SP 800-53?
