# Procedural/Sequential questions


What are the steps in the risk assessment process dexcribed in SP 800-30?

1.5101816328242421

The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-30 describes a structured approach to conduct risk assessments, particularly for security controls. The steps outlined in this document include:

1. Define the scope: Identify the assets or resources that need to be assessed for risk.

2. Determine the scope boundaries: Clearly define the geographical area and data to which the assessment applies.

3. Determine the attack models: Decide on the types of attacks you want to consider, such as low, moderate, high, or very high risk. Attack models are based on common threats and vulnerabilities that can lead to an adversary gaining unauthorized access.

4. Define the probability of occurrence (PoO) for each identified threat. Probability is a measure of how likely it is that an attack will occur given all factors are known.

5. Determine the impact of each identified threat, expressed as Effect (E), which represents the potential damage or loss if the attack were successful.

6. Determine the likelihood of detection (LOD) for each identified threat. This value indicates how likely it is that an adversary's attempt to exploit a vulnerability will be detected by security controls.

7. Calculate the risk metric (R). R = PoO x E / LOD

8. Assess control effectiveness: Identify existing security measures and assess their level of effectiveness against each identified threat. The assessment includes evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each control, its effectiveness at reducing risk, and whether the control is sufficient to mitigate the risk.

9. Calculate the total residual risk for each asset: Determine if it's feasible or appropriate to implement additional security controls (or increase existing measures) to further reduce the overall risk.

The final step in this process involves reviewing and revising the results based on new information, changing circumstances, or any other relevant factors.

Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.

1.2266804352402687

According to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-37, "Risk Management Framework Guide for Information and Communication Technology Systems," the Risk Management Framework (RMF) consists of six phases. These phases are:

1. **Conduct**: In this phase, you conduct a risk assessment to identify potential risks associated with an IT system or infrastructure. This involves gathering information about the system, its environment, and its stakeholders.

2. **Identify**: During this phase, you analyze the results from the initial risk assessment and prioritize potential security controls based on their effectiveness in mitigating identified risks. You then create a preliminary plan for implementing those controls.

3. **Implement**: In this phase, you put your chosen security controls into place. This involves acquiring or obtaining existing technologies, installing them, configuring settings, integrating new systems with existing ones, and conducting other necessary steps to implement the chosen controls.

4. **Maintain**: After the implementation of controls is complete, you must ensure that they remain effective over time. This phase involves monitoring systems for ongoing risks, reviewing results from previous risk assessments, and updating security controls as needed.

5. **Monitor**: In this phase, the IT system or infrastructure is continuously monitored to identify any issues or areas where security controls may need adjustments or improvements.

6. **Review**: At the end of each cycle (or at least every 2 years), you review your overall RMF process and update your risk assessment as necessary.

# Policy interpretation/Coneceptual paraphrasing


How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?

1.5231399429030716

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines "least privilege" as a security principle that restricts access to resources, systems, and data on an "as-needed" basis. The goal of least privilege is to minimize the attack surface by limiting the privileges and permissions granted to users, processes, and services.

In other words, the concept of least privilege states that:

1. Access should be granted only for specific purposes.
2. Access levels should be limited to the minimum required to perform tasks.
3. Users and systems should not have unnecessary or excessive privileges.

The importance of least privilege cannot be overstated, as it can help prevent various types of attacks, such as:

1. Privilege escalation: When an attacker gains control over a system or resource by exploiting vulnerabilities in user permissions.
2. Unauthorized access: When unauthorized users gain access to sensitive data or resources due to weak access controls.
3. Malware propagation: When malware can spread across a network because it has the necessary privileges to do so.

The benefits of least privilege include:

1. Reduced risk of security breaches
2. Improved incident response and remediation capabilities
3. Simplified security management and monitoring
4. Enhanced accountability and transparency
5. Better compliance with regulatory requirements

NIST Special Publication 800-53, "Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations," provides a set of guidelines and controls that implement the least privilege principle, including:

* Limiting user access to specific resources
* Implementing role-based access control (RBAC)
* Restricting privileges through mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC)
* Using least privilege principles for network services and applications

By following the principles of least privilege, organizations can significantly improve their security posture, reduce the risk of cyber threats, and meet regulatory requirements.

Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.

0.8862201208248734

According to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), the primary purpose of security categorization is to identify, assess, and prioritize potential security risks associated with an organization's assets, systems, or data.

Security categorization involves evaluating the sensitivity and value of an asset or system, as well as the likelihood and impact of a security breach. This process helps organizations to:

1. Identify critical assets and systems that require enhanced security controls.
2. Prioritize risk mitigation efforts based on the assessed risks.
3. Develop targeted security measures to address specific vulnerabilities.
4. Ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies.

NIST's guidance on security categorization is outlined in Special Publication 800-53, "Security Categorization of Information and Systems," which provides a framework for categorizing information and systems based on their sensitivity, impact, and likelihood of breach.

The goal of security categorization is to provide a clear understanding of the potential risks associated with an asset or system, allowing organizations to allocate resources effectively and make informed decisions about security investments.

# Misleading or contradictory phrasing


Is continuous monitoring a step in the risk assessment process according to SP 800-30?

0.3900648280978203

Yes, continuous monitoring is a step in the risk assessment process according to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-30. Specifically, it is part of Step 6: "Implementing and Maintaining Controls", which involves:

* Continuously implementing controls based on initial findings
* Monitoring for effectiveness of implemented controls
* Updating and modifying controls as needed

SP 800-30 is a guide for protecting federal information systems and networks from cyber threats.

Does SP 800-171 recommend two-factor authentication for all users?

0.527666546870023

No, SP 800-171 does not specifically require two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users. While it is a best practice to use 2FA to add an extra layer of security, the document only specifies requirements for access controls and security measures related to access to controlled unclassified information.

However, 2FA is recommended as part of the implementation guidance in SP 800-171 Rev 1. For example, for any user who has a need-to-know (NTK) level that allows them to perform functions on an organization's Federal Information System (FIS), two-factor authentication should be implemented.
