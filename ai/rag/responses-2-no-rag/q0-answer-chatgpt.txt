# Direct fact recall  
**What is the primary purpose of NIST SP 800-53?**  
NIST SP 800-53 provides a comprehensive set of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations, aiming to improve risk management and compliance with federal regulations.  

**According to SP 800-30, what is the definition of 'risk'?**  
NIST SP 800-30 defines 'risk' as the potential for loss, damage, or destruction of assets or data due to a threat exploiting a vulnerability.  

**Which publication provides guidance on incident response planning?**  
NIST SP 800-61, "Computer Security Incident Handling Guide," provides guidance on incident response planning.

# Chunk reasoning  
**How does NIST SP 800-61 relate to NIST SP 800-137 in terms of continuous monitoring and incident response?**  
NIST SP 800-61 focuses on incident response, detailing how organizations should prepare for, detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents. NIST SP 800-137 provides guidelines for continuous monitoring to maintain ongoing situational awareness and risk management. Together, they ensure that security incidents are detected in real time and addressed effectively.  

**What role does asset management play in both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37?**  
In NIST SP 800-171, asset management ensures that only authorized users and systems access controlled unclassified information (CUI), requiring inventory and protection of assets. In NIST SP 800-37, asset management is a key part of the Risk Management Framework (RMF), helping to identify and categorize assets to assess risks and implement security controls accordingly.

# Procedural/Sequential questions  
**What are the steps in the risk assessment process described in SP 800-30?**  
1. **Prepare for assessment** – Define scope, purpose, and assumptions.  
2. **Identify threats** – Determine potential threat sources and events.  
3. **Identify vulnerabilities** – Assess weaknesses in the system.  
4. **Determine likelihood of occurrence** – Evaluate the probability of threats exploiting vulnerabilities.  
5. **Determine impact** – Assess potential consequences of an incident.  
6. **Assess risk** – Combine likelihood and impact to determine risk level.  
7. **Communicate and share results** – Document and report findings.  
8. **Maintain assessment** – Update risk assessments as necessary.  

**Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.**  
1. **Prepare** – Establish organizational context, roles, and risk management strategy.  
2. **Categorize** – Define the impact level of information and systems.  
3. **Select** – Choose security controls based on risk assessment.  
4. **Implement** – Apply and document security controls.  
5. **Assess** – Evaluate the effectiveness of security controls.  
6. **Authorize** – Make risk-based decisions on system operation.  
7. **Monitor** – Continuously assess and improve security posture.

# Policy interpretation/Conceptual paraphrasing  
**How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?**  
NIST defines 'least privilege' as the principle that users, applications, and systems should only have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions. It is important because it reduces the attack surface, limits potential damage from security breaches, and minimizes unauthorized access to sensitive data.  

**Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.**  
Security categorization helps organizations classify information systems based on their impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This ensures appropriate security controls are applied according to the system’s risk level, improving overall cybersecurity and compliance.

# Rare or niche topics  
**What does SP 800-160 say about systems engineering principles for secure design?**  
NIST SP 800-160 emphasizes integrating security into the entire system lifecycle using engineering principles such as defense in depth, resilience, least privilege, and continuous monitoring. It advocates for security as a foundational aspect rather than an add-on.  

**What guidance is given on quantum-resistant cryptography in SP 800-208?**  
NIST SP 800-208 provides guidance on selecting and implementing quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms to prepare for the eventual threat posed by quantum computers. It highlights transition strategies and recommends hybrid cryptographic approaches.  

---  
# Misleading or contradictory phrasing  
**Is continuous monitoring a step in the risk assessment process according to SP 800-30?**  
No, continuous monitoring is not a direct step in the risk assessment process in SP 800-30. However, it is part of the broader risk management process, helping organizations track security risks over time.  

**Does SP 800-171 recommend two-factor authentication for all users?**  
No, SP 800-171 does not mandate two-factor authentication for all users but strongly recommends it for privileged accounts and remote access scenarios.  

---  
# Out of scope/control  
**What is the difference between ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53?**  
ISO 27001 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS), focusing on risk-based security controls and certification. NIST SP 800-53 is a U.S. federal guideline detailing security and privacy controls for government systems, with a stronger regulatory focus.  

**Who was the original author of SP 800-53?**  
NIST SP 800-53 was originally developed by Dr. Ron Ross and his team at NIST as part of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) compliance framework.
