According to SP 800-30, what is the definition of 'risk'?

4.054391727084294

 According to NIST SP 800-30, risk is a function of the likelihood of a threat event's occurrence and potential adverse impact should the event occur. This definition accommodates many types of adverse impacts at all tiers in the risk management hierarchy, and it allows risk to be represented as a single value or as a vector (i.e., multiple values). For purposes of risk communication, risk is generally grouped according to the types of adverse impacts (and possibly the time frames in which those impacts are likely to be experienced).

# Chunk reasoning


How does NIST SP 800-61 relate to NIST SP 800-137 in terms of continuous monitoring and incident response?

4.821519271004945

 NIST SP 800-61 and NIST SP 800-137 are two different publications under the NIST Special Publications (SP) series, each focusing on a specific aspect of cybersecurity.

NIST SP 800-61 provides recommendations for organizing and managing computer security incident response capabilities to effectively detect, respond to, and mitigate the effects of computer security incidents. It does not focus on continuous monitoring but emphasizes effective handling of any type of incident once it occurs.

On the other hand, NIST SP 800-137, Guide for Cyber Threat Information Sharing provides recommendations for managing cyber threat information in a manner that supports the needs of both government and private sector organizations. It focuses on continuous monitoring by providing guidelines for sharing threat information to improve situational awareness and enable timely response to emerging threats.

While they are separate publications, there is an overlap between their recommended practices, particularly when it comes to incident handling and response. For example, continuous monitoring can help in the early detection of incidents, allowing for a prompt response as recommended in SP 800-61. Similarly, sharing threat information as outlined in SP 800-137 can aid in understanding potential attack vectors that could be exploited in an incident, thus improving the overall cybersecurity posture and incident response capabilities.

What role does asset management play in both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37

4.276378066046163

 In both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37, Asset Management plays a crucial role. Specifically, in SP 800-171, it is addressed under SC-07(05) with supporting publications such as SP 800-41, SP 800-77, and SP 800-189. This aspect of the document emphasizes managing information system assets throughout their life cycle to maintain appropriate security controls.

   On the other hand, in SP 800-37, Asset Management is directly covered under CA-5. Here, it focuses on maintaining an inventory of all organizational information systems and ensuring that necessary safeguarding controls are implemented for these assets. The supporting publication for this aspect is SP 800-162.

   In summary, Asset Management in both documents is about managing the life cycle of information system assets to ensure their appropriate protection.

# Procedural/Sequential questions


What are the steps in the risk assessment process dexcribed in SP 800-30?

4.524742821929976

 The risk assessment process described in SP 800-30 includes four main steps:

1. Preparing for the assessment, which involves determining the scope and purpose of the assessment, identifying stakeholders, collecting information about the system and the organization, and defining the assessment methodology.

2. Conducting the assessment, which involves identifying assets, vulnerabilities, and threats; estimating the likelihood and impact of potential threats; and calculating the risk level for each identified risk.

3. Communicating the results of the assessment, where the objective is to ensure that decision makers across the organization have the appropriate risk-related information needed to inform and guide risk decisions. This step consists of communicating the risk assessment results and sharing information developed in the execution of the risk assessment.

4. Maintaining the assessment, which involves reviewing and updating the assessment on a regular basis to ensure that it remains accurate and relevant. This may involve re-evaluating risk levels as the system or organization changes, and adjusting controls and strategies accordingly.

Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.

5.477789156837389

 The Risk Management Framework (RMF) as described in SP 800-37 consists of the following main phases, each with specific tasks and activities:

1. **Prepare**: This phase sets the stage for the RMF by defining risk management roles and responsibilities, establishing a risk management strategy, identifying stakeholders, and understanding the system and its environment.

2. **Categorize**: During this phase, the information system is categorized based on factors such as the type of data handled, potential impact if compromised, and the operational requirements. This helps in determining an appropriate level of security controls for the system.

3. **Select**: In this phase, the suitable security and privacy controls are chosen from various sources like NIST SP 800-53 (Revision 5) or other applicable standards and guidelines. The controls are selected based on the categorization results and risk management strategy.

4. **Implement**: This phase involves implementing the chosen security and privacy controls, configuring them appropriately, and documenting the process.

5. **Assess**: During this phase, an assessment is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented controls in reducing the risk to an acceptable level.

6. **Authorize**: Once the assessment results indicate that the risk has been mitigated to an acceptable level, the system can be authorized for operation. The Authorization Document (AD) outlines the approved configuration of security and privacy controls.

7. **Monitor**: In this phase, continuous monitoring processes are implemented to ensure that the security and privacy controls remain effective in mitigating risk over time, as well as detecting any deviations from the authorized configuration or potential threats.

These phases help organizations apply a disciplined, structured, and flexible approach to managing security and privacy risks associated with their information systems effectively.

# Policy interpretation/Coneceptual paraphrasing


How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?

3.891344650881365

 According to NIST SP800-53 Rev. 5, 'Least Privilege' refers to a system component being allocated only the necessary privileges to perform its specified functions and no more. This principle is essential because applying the least privilege limits the scope of a component's actions. Two desirable effects of this principle are that the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the component will have a minimized security impact, and the security analysis of the component will be simplified. The concept of 'Least Privilege' also reduces the attack surface of the system, making it less vulnerable to potential cyber threats.

Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.

4.414641120936722

 According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), security categorization is a crucial preliminary activity for the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) process. Its primary purpose is to establish the levels of rigor needed for the certification and overall assurance testing of security controls, as well as additional activities such as privacy and critical infrastructure protection.

The resulting security categorization from this process guides various activities like security control selection, privacy impact analysis, and critical infrastructure analysis. Furthermore, it aids in determining the level of effort and associated activity duration required for the C&A process. The categorization should be reevaluated every three years or when significant changes occur to the system or supporting business lines.
