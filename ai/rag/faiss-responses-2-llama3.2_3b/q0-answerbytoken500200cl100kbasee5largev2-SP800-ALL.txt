# Procedural/Sequential questions


What are the steps in the risk assessment process dexcribed in SP 800-30?

3.4563468592241406

Here is a summary of the steps in the risk assessment process as described in NIST Special Publication 800-30:

**Preparation for Risk Assessments**

1. Identify the purpose and scope of the risk assessment.
2. Identify the assumptions and constraints under which the risk assessment is conducted.
3. Identify sources of threat, vulnerability, and impact information to be used in the risk assessment.
4. Define or refine the risk model, assessment approach, and analysis approach to be used in the risk assessment.

**Conducting the Risk Assessment**

1. Conduct an initial risk assessment to determine the security categorization of the system, which informs the selection of initial baseline security controls.
2. Perform a risk assessment as part of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to the system.
3. Use the results of the risk assessment to inform the selection of security controls and to determine the level of tailoring required.

**Update Assessments**

1. Update risk assessments on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in the organization's risk environment, new threats or vulnerabilities, or changes in organizational policies or procedures.
2. Conduct updated risk assessments as part of the SDLC to ensure that the system remains secure and aligned with organizational risk tolerance.

The risk assessment process can be integrated into the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of each organization. The goal of the risk assessment process is to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to the system, to determine the level of risk posed by those threats and vulnerabilities, and to inform the selection of security controls and tailoring activities.

Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.

3.6840686528012156

The Risk Management Framework (RMF) has three main levels of risk management: Levels 1, 2, and 3. Here are the phases of the RMF as per SP 800-37:

**Level 1: Organization-Wide Risk Management**

* Mission and Business Planning Activities
* Enterprise Architecture
* SDLC Processes (System Development Life Cycle)
* Systems Engineering Activities

This level is concerned with managing risk at the organization level, including the mission and business objectives, enterprise architecture, and system development life cycle processes.

**Level 2: Mission/Business Process Level**

* Mission or Business Function
* Key Stakeholders (Internal and External)
* Asset Identification and Prioritization
* Risk Assessment and Prioritization
* Authorization Boundaries for Information Systems and Common Controls

This level is concerned with managing risk at the mission/business process level, including identifying key stakeholders, asset prioritization, and authorization boundaries.

**Level 3: Information System Level**

* Information System Identification and Alignment with Mission/Business Process
* Security and Privacy Architecture Development
* Control Selection and Implementation
* Risk Assessment and Continuous Monitoring

This level is concerned with managing risk at the information system level, including identifying and aligning information systems with the mission/business process, developing a security and privacy architecture, and selecting and implementing controls.

The RMF also includes five phases:

1. **Initial Planning**: This phase involves establishing roles and responsibilities, identifying stakeholders, and determining the organization's risk tolerance.
2. **Risk Assessment**: This phase involves conducting risk assessments to identify potential risks and threats to information systems.
3. **Control Selection**: This phase involves selecting controls to mitigate identified risks.
4. **Implementation**: This phase involves implementing selected controls and monitoring their effectiveness.
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: This phase involves ongoing monitoring of the information system's security and privacy posture to ensure that it remains effective.

These phases are iterative, meaning that they may overlap or repeat at different stages of the RMF implementation process.

# Policy interpretation/Coneceptual paraphrasing


How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?

3.343744901008904

The term "least privilege" refers to an access control principle that grants users only the minimum level of privilege necessary to perform their assigned tasks. This means that users should not have more access or authority than they need to accomplish their specific duties.

Least privilege is important for several reasons:

1. **Reduced risk**: When users have fewer privileges, they are less likely to accidentally or intentionally cause harm to the system or data.
2. **Improved security**: Least privilege helps to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities by having a higher level of access than they need.
3. **Increased efficiency**: By limiting user privileges, administrators can reduce the administrative burden of managing and monitoring access to systems and data.
4. **Better accountability**: When users have fewer privileges, it is easier to track and account for their actions, making it more difficult for malicious actors to cover their tracks.

In the context of NIST guidelines, least privilege is a critical component of an effective access control strategy. It is essential to regularly review and update access authorizations to ensure that users only have the minimum level of privilege necessary to perform their tasks.

To implement least privilege effectively:

1. **Conduct regular access reviews**: Identify and eliminate unnecessary privileges.
2. **Use role-based access control (RBAC)**: Assign privileges based on user roles rather than individual accounts.
3. **Implement segregation of duties**: Divide tasks among users to prevent any one person from having too much authority.
4. **Monitor access logs**: Regularly review access records to detect and respond to potential security incidents.

By embracing the principle of least privilege, organizations can significantly improve their overall security posture while also reducing administrative burdens and costs.

Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.

3.077254056930542

According to NIST, the purpose of security categorization is to determine the level of risk associated with an information system and to establish a baseline for security controls. This process involves evaluating the potential impact of an information system on organizational operations, assets, and individuals, as well as identifying the likelihood of a security breach or incident.

The primary goals of security categorization are:

1. To provide a framework for assessing the risk associated with an information system
2. To establish a baseline for security controls that can be used to protect the organization's assets and operations
3. To ensure that the selected security controls are sufficient to mitigate the identified risks

Security categorization provides input into several subsequent steps in the NIST Risk Management Framework, including:

1. Selecting an initial set of security controls based on the FIPS 199 security categorization
2. Implementing the security controls in the information system
3. Assessing the security controls to determine their effectiveness
4. Authorizing the operation of the information system based on a determination of the risk and the decision that it is acceptable

Overall, the purpose of security categorization is to provide a systematic and structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with an information system.

It provides guidance on systems security engineering with an emphasis on protection against asset loss, as well as frameworks for addressing resilience and cyber resiliency.

In summary, SP 800-160 emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to system design that incorporates multiple aspects of trustworthiness, including security, reliability, safety, and resilience. By using systems engineering principles and incorporating security measures or safeguards as a foundational part of the architecture and design, organizations can create cyber-resilient systems that can withstand cyber threats and continue to operate effectively in degraded or debilitated states.

What guidance is given on quantum-resistant cryptography in SP 800-208?

2.793570574838668

SP 800-208 provides guidance on post-quantum cryptography, not specifically quantum-resistant cryptography. 

Post-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic techniques that can resist attacks by quantum computers, which are expected to become more powerful and capable of breaking many current encryption algorithms in the future.

Quantum-resistant cryptography, on the other hand, is a specific set of cryptographic techniques that are designed to be resistant to attacks by both classical computers and quantum computers. These techniques often use different mathematical problems or algorithms than traditional cryptography, such as lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, hash-based signatures, and multivariate cryptography.

SP 800-208 provides recommendations for implementing post-quantum cryptography in federal agencies, including a list of recommended cryptographic schemes that are resistant to attacks by quantum computers.

# Misleading or contradictory phrasing


Is continuous monitoring a step in the risk assessment process according to SP 800-30?

2.281931610777974

Yes, continuous monitoring is a step in the risk assessment process according to SP 800-30. According to the document, "Monitor risk factors identified in risk assessments on an ongoing basis and update the components of risk assessments reflecting the monitoring activities carried out by organizations." This implies that continuous monitoring is necessary to ensure that the information needed to make credible, risk-based decisions continues to be available over time.

Does SP 800-171 recommend two-factor authentication for all users?

3.960236079990864

SP 800-171 does not specifically mention the term "two-factor authentication" throughout the document. However, it does discuss various types of authentication mechanisms, such as:

1. Passwords
2. Multi-factor authentication (MFAC)
3. Challenge-response one-time authenticators
4. Time synchronous one-time authenticators

The document recommends using multi-factor authentication for access to privileged and non-privileged accounts.

While the term "two-factor authentication" is not used explicitly, it is implied by the discussion of MFAC, which involves using two or more different factors to achieve authentication (e.g., something you know + something you have).

Therefore, the answer to your question is that SP 800-171 does recommend using a multi-factor authentication mechanism, such as MFAC, for access control, but it does not use the specific term "two-factor authentication".
