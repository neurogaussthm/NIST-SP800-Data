What is the primary purpose of NIST SP 800-53? 

3.264023137278855

The primary purpose of NIST SP 800-53 is to establish security and privacy control baselines for federal information systems. These control baselines are derived from the controls in [SP 800-53], and they align with requirements found in [OMB A-130], Federal Information Processing Standard 199 (FIPS 199), and Federal Information Processing Standard 200 (FIPS 200). The publication aims to help organizations manage security risk and privacy risk by providing guidance on selecting appropriate security controls through the use of tailoring guidance in Chapter Two.

According to SP 800-30, what is the definition of 'risk'?

2.7143553006462753

According to SP 800-30, risk is defined as "the combined effect of threat and vulnerability, leading to a potential adverse impact on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the economic and national security interests of the United States." In simpler terms, risk refers to the likelihood of a specific event causing harm or negative consequences to an organization due to its information systems and processed/stored data. The potential for this adverse impact is determined by evaluating two main factors: threat (the ability of adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities) and vulnerability (weaknesses in information systems that can be exploited).

What role does asset management play in both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37

3.6642880593426526

In both the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171 and SP 800-37, asset management plays a crucial role in identifying, cataloging, tracking, and protecting organizational assets.

For SP 800-171, which focuses on protecting controlled unclassified information (CUI), asset management involves:

1. Identifying all systems, software, and data that contain or process CUI.
2. Determining the classification level of each identified item as low, medium, or high.
3. Implementing appropriate security controls to safeguard these assets based on their classification levels.
4. Regularly monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of these controls.
5. Maintaining accurate records of all CUI-containing systems, software, and data for auditing purposes.

On the other hand, SP 800-37 is a more comprehensive standard that applies to federal information systems and organizations (FISCOs). Asset management in this context includes:

1. Identifying and classifying all information, facilities, and personnel within an organization's information systems, following the NIST classification scheme for federal information.
2. Developing and maintaining a system catalog to track the location of each asset throughout their lifecycle.
3. Implementing appropriate security measures and access controls for each asset based on its classification level (unclassified, sensitive, or restricted).
4. Continuously monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of these security controls.
5. Maintaining accurate records of all assets, including their location, status, and associated security requirements.

In summary, both SP 800-171 and SP 800-37 emphasize asset management as a critical aspect of protecting organizational information systems, ensuring that appropriate controls are in place to safeguard sensitive data based on its classification level, and maintaining accurate records for auditing purposes.

# Procedural/Sequential questions


What are the steps in the risk assessment process dexcribed in SP 800-30?

4.674734586849809

The risk assessment process described in SP 800-30 consists of several key steps:

1. **IDENTIFY RISK MODEL AND ANALYTIC APPROACH (Task 1-5)**: Organizations define one or more risk models, which include the risk factors (threat, vulnerability, impact, likelihood, and predisposing condition), and identify the analytic approach to be used for the risk assessment. This may involve selecting from predefined scales in the appendices or creating organization-specific scales with meaningful examples.

2. **IDENTIFY RISK FACTORS (Task 1-6)**: Organizations determine which risk factors are relevant for their specific context, such as new threat events, vulnerabilities, predisposing conditions, undesirable consequences, and affected assets.

3. **VALUATE RISK FACTORS (Tasks 2-1 to 2-5)** : Using the chosen analytic approach, organizations assess each risk factor based on its characteristics, likelihoods, and impacts. This can be done using qualitative or semi-quantitative scales.

4. **COMBINE RISK FACTORS (Task 2-6)**: Organizations apply their organization-specific algorithms to combine the values of individual risk factors into a combined measure representing the overall risk for the system, asset, or business function being evaluated.

5. **UPDATE RISK ASSESSMENT (Task 4-1 to 4-2)** : Periodically, organizations review and update their existing risk assessments based on changes in risk factors due to ongoing monitoring of these elements. This process identifies new threats, vulnerabilities, predisposing conditions, undesirable consequences, or affected assets and assesses the impacts and likelihoods accordingly.

6. **COMMUNICATE RISK ASSESSMENT RESULTS (Task 5-1 to 5-3)**: The results of risk assessments are communicated to responsible organizational officials across all risk management tiers, ensuring they have access to crucial information for making ongoing risk-based decisions.

7. **RECONFIRM PURPOSE, SCOPE, AND ASSUMPTIONS (Task 5-2)**: Before conducting a new risk assessment or updating an existing one, organizations revisit the purpose, scope, and assumptions of the previous assessment to ensure consistency with current objectives and organizational context.

8. **RECONDUCT APPROPRIATE RISK ASSESSMENT TASKS (Task 5-3 as needed)**: Based on updated risk factors or other relevant information, organizations revisit and may repeat specific tasks from Tasks 2-1 to 2-5 when conducting a subsequent risk assessment.

9. **REMAINING KEY ACTIVITIES – MAINTAINING RISK ASSESSMENTS** :

   - Identify key risk factors that require ongoing monitoring
   - Determine the frequency of risk factor monitoring activities and circumstances necessitating updates to risk assessments
   - Communicate results from subsequent risk assessments to all relevant organizational personnel.

Describe the phases of the risk management framework (RMF) as per SP 800-37.

4.071188196074218

The Risk Management Framework (RMF), as described in SP 800-37, consists of seven phases designed to manage information system-related security and privacy risk at three levels: organizational, mission/business process, and information system level. These phases are:

1. **Planning:**
   - Define the RMF scope, objectives, and policies.
   - Identify and prioritize systems based on their role in supporting organizational missions or business functions.

2. **Assess:**
   - Perform security control assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls.
   - Document and catalog information system components (ISC), including devices, software, data, and people that implement security controls.
   - Determine the overall security classification level of each ISC based on its impact on the organization's operations and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and information.

3. **Implement:**
   - Acquire, configure, and deploy appropriate security controls to meet the requirements established during the assessment phase.
   - Establish a process for monitoring, maintaining, and updating control configurations throughout their lifecycle.

4. **Authorize:**
   - Document and justify decisions about what security requirements must be met by each ISC based on its role in supporting organizational missions or business functions.
   - Determine authorization boundaries for systems and data to enforce separation of duties and the principle of least privilege.

5. **Perform:**
   - Implement processes to operate, monitor, and maintain information systems and their security controls according to RMF requirements.
   - Perform periodic security assessments to verify that implemented controls remain effective in preventing, detecting, and responding to threats.

6. **Evaluate:**
   - Evaluate the overall effectiveness of the RMF by comparing actual system security control status with the planned security control configurations.
   - Determine whether each ISC is operating within its authorized boundaries.

7. **Authorizing: System Owner (AO) and Authority to Exercise (ATE):**
   - Document and justify decisions about what AOs have the authority to exercise control over specific ISCs based on their role in supporting organizational missions or business functions.

By following these seven phases, organizations can systematically manage security and privacy risks throughout their information systems landscape, ensuring compliance with security policies while optimizing resource allocation and simplifying processes.

# Policy interpretation/Coneceptual paraphrasing


How does NIST define the term 'least privilege', and why is it important?

3.227268176153302

NIST defines "least privilege" as a principle that requires programs and users to operate with only the necessary privileges to perform their intended tasks, rather than having extensive or overly broad permissions. This concept applies both to software development and user account management.

The importance of least privilege lies in its ability to minimize potential damage from security breaches, unauthorized code execution, and malware attacks. When users and applications are granted the minimum required privileges:

1. The attack surface is reduced, limiting an attacker's opportunities for exploitation.
2. In case of a compromise, the impact on the system is minimized as the adversary will only have limited access.
3. The principle helps enforce separation of duties and prevent unauthorized actions by ensuring users cannot easily gain elevated privileges through accidental or malicious exploitation of their accounts.
4. By following least privilege, organizations can more effectively manage and secure their systems, as well as maintain compliance with various security standards and regulations.

In summary, NIST emphasizes the importance of adhering to the principle of least privilege because it enhances overall system security, reduces risk, and better aligns with secure development practices.

Explain the purpose of security categorization according to NIST.

3.50000666314736

According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the primary purpose of security categorization is to provide a standardized framework for assessing, managing, and protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data based on their perceived risk levels. This process helps organizations align their information management practices with strategic objectives and risk tolerance.

The NIST 800-171 security control assessment guide outlines that security categorization involves identifying, classifying, and assigning appropriate security controls to information systems based on the sensitivity of data they handle. These categories typically range from unclassified (lowest) to restricted (highest), with each category having increasingly stringent requirements for protecting sensitive information.

The main objectives of security categorization are:
1. To ensure that organizational resources are protected according to their actual or potential risk to the organization's operations, assets, and people.
2. To enable effective management of security controls and resources by providing a common language for discussing and implementing them.
3. To support continuous monitoring, assessment, and improvement of information systems' security posture.
4. To promote accountability in making decisions about implementing, modifying, or waiving security controls based on the categorized risk levels of information systems.

What guidance is given on quantum-resistant cryptography in SP 800-208?

4.0734297088347375

Quantum-resistant cryptography is addressed in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-208, titled "Post-Quantum Cryptography for Key Protection." This publication provides guidance on the selection of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms to protect long-term security keys. It emphasizes the importance of transitioning from current cryptographic systems, which are vulnerable to attacks by quantum computers, to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that can maintain security even when large-scale quantum computers become available.

Key aspects of SP 800-208 include:

1. Recommendations for key sizes and parameters: The publication suggests using larger key sizes than those currently in use, which would provide resistance against attacks from both classical and quantum computers. Specifically, it proposes a "quantum-safe" key size of at least 3072 bits for symmetric algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECC) and 15360 bits for asymmetric algorithms to ensure security against adversaries with access to sufficiently powerful quantum devices.

2. Quantum-resistant algorithms: SP 800-208 discusses various post-quantum cryptographic algorithms suitable for key protection, such as the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem-based schemes and the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem-based lattice-based algorithms. It recommends evaluating these algorithms' security properties, computational overhead, and compatibility with existing systems before implementation.

3. Hybrid cryptosystems: The publication encourages the use of hybrid cryptosystems that combine classical cryptographic methods with post-quantum algorithms to leverage their benefits while maintaining interoperability with legacy systems during a transition period.

4. Monitoring and testing: SP 800-208 suggests ongoing monitoring of advances in quantum computing and research on new post-quantum algorithms, as well as continuous testing of cryptographic implementations to ensure they remain secure against potential future threats.

By following the guidance provided in NIST SP 800-208, organizations can effectively incorporate quantum-resistant cryptography into their systems to protect long-term keys and maintain information assurance even when confronted with quantum computing power.

# Misleading or contradictory phrasing


Is continuous monitoring a step in the risk assessment process according to SP 800-30?

3.1874225358478725

No, continuous monitoring is not explicitly listed as a step within the risk assessment process in SP 800-30. However, it is an integral part of the overall approach to managing risks throughout the system development life cycle (SDLC), from pre-system acquisition through sustainment. Continuous monitoring supports ongoing risk management and informs various activities such as:

1. System development lifecycle stages (pre-system acquisition, engineering/manufacturing development, production/deployment, operations/support)
2. Security solution design and implementation for information systems and environments of operation
3. Authorizations for operating or using security controls inherited by those systems
4. Ongoing security solutions maintenance including continuous monitoring strategies and programs
5. Modification of missions, business functions, or processes based on new threats, vulnerabilities, or changing environmental conditions

While continuous monitoring is not explicitly named as a step within the risk assessment process in SP 800-30, its importance lies in providing timely and regular information to update and refine risk assessments and support better decision-making in an ever-changing risk landscape.

Does SP 800-171 recommend two-factor authentication for all users?

2.3645898662507534

No, SP 800-171 does not universally recommend two-factor authentication for all users. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to both privileged and non-privileged accounts. The specific number of factors required can vary depending on the organization's risk assessment and security posture. While MFA with at least two distinct categories is encouraged, organizations may choose to implement additional factors based on their unique needs and potential risks.

# Out of scope/control


What is the difference between ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53?

4.340142356231809

ISO 27001 and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 are both prominent frameworks for information security management, but they have distinct differences in their scope, focus, and application.

1. **Scope**: ISO 27001 is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), focusing on information security management systems (ISMS) to manage sensitive organizational information securely. It provides a set of best practices, requirements, and guidelines for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an ISMS within an organization. On the other hand, NIST SP 800-53 is a U.S. government publication by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), offering a detailed catalog of security and privacy controls tailored to protect federal information systems and organizations against cyber threats and exposures.

2. **Focus**: ISO 27001 primarily concentrates on managing and securing an organization's entire information system, including processes, people, infrastructure, and applications. It emphasizes the development of a comprehensive ISMS that integrates security requirements into the overall management structure. In contrast, NIST SP 800-53 concentrates more specifically on federal information systems and organizations, providing a detailed list of mandatory controls to secure sensitive data and systems based on risk assessments.

3. **Applications**: ISO 27001 can be applied by any organization seeking to implement an effective ISMS for managing information security risks, regardless of their industry or location. It offers flexibility in applying the standard's requirements according to the size, structure, and characteristics of the targeted organization. NIST SP 800-53 is specifically designed for federal agencies and organizations that handle classified national security systems, providing a more prescriptive set of mandatory controls to secure their information assets based on risk assessments.

4. **Certification**: ISO 27001 certification involves an independent audit process conducted by certification bodies (CBs) registered with recognized standardization body organizations (RSBOs). NIST does not offer a formal certification program for compliance with its security control catalog, although the U.S. government itself uses these controls as part of its Information Security Operations Center (ISOC) management and monitoring processes.

In summary, while both ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53 address information security and privacy, they serve different purposes and target distinct audiences – the former for broad ISMS implementation in various organizations, and the latter specifically for protecting federal information systems.

Who was the original author of SP 800-53?

2.465777087956667

The original author of NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the authors were a team of experts from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as this publication is part of their extensive catalog of security and privacy standards. The evolution of SP 800-53, particularly its revisions up to SP 800-53B, reflects continuous efforts by NIST to improve and update these foundational controls for information systems and organizations based on the latest threat intelligence, cyber-attack data, and emerging best practices.

What color does red and blue make?

2.353652518708259

Red and blue mixed together don't form a new color; they create a shade of purple known as magenta when viewed at certain angles, depending on the specific shades used. This is due to the way our eyes perceive color. The exact hue can vary, but it generally falls within the range of light purples or pinks.

In terms of NIST SP 800 series, there's no direct relevance as this is a topic of general color theory and perception, not cybersecurity policy. However, the understanding of how colors interact can be applied to create visual indicators in certain security contexts, such as using red-blue combinations for warning signals or other specific purposes.

# Scenario test


A new company is looking to begin a cybersecurity program. They already have an IT program, and they aren't sure where to start. What policies should they start with?

4.214281984139234

For the new company starting its cybersecurity program, they should begin by developing System-specific Policies based on the information provided in SP800-12 Rev. 1. Here's a suggested sequence of steps to create an effective cybersecurity framework:

1. **Security Objectives**: Define specific, concrete, and achievable security objectives tailored to their system needs. This may include objectives related to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Involve stakeholders in this process for comprehensive yet practical policies.

2. **Operational Security Rules**: Once security objectives are established, create operational rules that manage and operate the system according to those objectives. These rules should specify authorized modifications, individuals allowed to perform certain actions under particular conditions with respect to specific classes or records of information. The level of detail in these rules depends on the system's complexity and sensitivity.

3. **System-specific Policies**: Based on security objectives and operational rules, develop System-specific policies that dictate how personnel should implement required security controls for their respective systems. These policies must be clear, easily understandable by technical and non-technical staff alike, and aligned with the overall organizational information security goals.

4. **Information Security Policy**: As an aggregate of directives, regulations, rules, practices, and standards, construct a comprehensive Information Security Policy that encompasses these system-specific policies. This policy should be flexible enough to cover all aspects of the company's technical resources while guiding employee behavior to protect those resources effectively.

5. **Standards, Guidelines, and Procedures**: Develop supporting standards, guidelines, and procedures based on the established information security policy. Standards specify uniform use of specific technologies, parameters or procedures for overall organizational benefit; guidelines provide assistance in securing systems without enforcing strict compliance across all environments.

6. **Continuous Review and Compliance**: Establish a process to routinely review system-specific policies for conformance with the most recent security procedures. This continuous monitoring ensures that the cybersecurity program remains up-to-date, effective, and aligned with evolving threats and best practices.

We are an organization that has an established cybersecurity program, but we're looking to be more proactive in following federal policy. What would you recommend?

4.824981094803661

To align your organization's existing cybersecurity program with federal policies like FISMA and E.O. 13800, I recommend implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) using the Risk Management Framework (RMF) process. Here are some steps to help you achieve this:

1. **Assess**: Understand your current cybersecurity posture by identifying and categorizing your federal information systems, based on their level of criticality to the agency's mission. This will help you focus on the most important systems for risk management purposes.

2. **Implement**: Develop a comprehensive set of controls aligned with CSF's five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The identified controls should be consistent with industry best practices or standards such as NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, or Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls. Implement these controls to ensure they are properly configured, operating, and maintained within your federal information systems.

3. **Authorize**: Establish a system for continuously monitoring the performance of your implemented controls and maintaining adequate documentation that demonstrates compliance with the required protection levels as specified in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). You will also need to identify any gaps between your current cybersecurity posture and desired security levels, which you can address by adjusting your implementation or configuration of existing controls.

4. **Perform**: Periodically assess the effectiveness of your implemented controls by conducting internal audits, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and other tests as per RMF's Continuous Monitoring process. This will help ensure that controls continue to perform as intended and provide adequate protection for your federal information systems.

5. **Implement Supplemental Procedures**: To further support continuous monitoring and risk management efforts, consider implementing additional supplementary procedures from NIST Special Publication 800-43 (Supplemental Technical Guide to the RMF) or other relevant sources, such as those related to Configuration Management, Security Assessment and Authorization, Account Management, Access Control, Data Security, Incident Response Planning, and Business Continuity.

6. **Document**: Maintain up-to-date documentation on your cybersecurity program, including the RMP, continuous monitoring activities, control assessments, incident response plans, and other relevant processes. This documentation will be essential to demonstrate compliance with federal policies like FISMA and E.O. 13800 when requested by auditors or regulatory bodies.

7. **Review**: Regularly review your cybersecurity program and its components against the ever-evolving threat landscape, changes in agency missions, and updates to federal policies like FISMA and E.O. 13800. Be prepared to update your RMP and controls as needed to maintain adequate security for your federal information systems.

By following these steps and actively engaging with the NIST CSF using the RMF process, you can help ensure that your organization proactively aligns its cybersecurity program with federal policies such as FISMA and E.O. 13800, while also maintaining robust security practices in line with industry best practices.

What regulations do we need to follow to take work from the DoE?

4.225457627791911

When working with Department of Energy (DoE) records or systems that store sensitive information, you should adhere to the following regulations and standards:

1. Federal Records Act and NARA Regulations: These laws govern how federal agencies manage their records, including those held by contractors like cloud service providers. Contractors must securely store, maintain retrievability, and properly dispose of federal records according to the requirements set forth in 36 CFR Part 12.

2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): HIPAA applies to health care providers, including those under the Veterans Health Administration, and sets technical and physical safeguards for controlling access to protected health information (PHI). Organizations must ensure their cloud service providers comply with these requirements when handling PHI.

3. Privacy Act: The Privacy Act regulates federal agencies' collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal information about individuals, including government employees. Organizations should ensure that their chosen cloud provider respects the privacy rights under this law.

4. Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA): FISMA requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program for managing information security. Organizations using DoE systems or data must work with a cloud service provider that adheres to applicable FISMA standards.

5. Other industry-specific regulations: Depending on the nature of your organization's activities, you may also need to comply with other sector-specific regulations, such as those under the Financial Services Information Security Act (FSISA) or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) for financial institutions.

6. Cloud service agreements: Organizations must carefully review and negotiate contracts with cloud providers to ensure they meet the necessary security, privacy, and compliance requirements. It is crucial that the provider agrees to be liable in their service agreement for exposure of content under their control and maintains data location within the organization's jurisdiction when required by law or regulation.

In summary, while taking work from DoE, organizations must comply with Federal Records Act, NARA Regulations, HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, and any other sector-specific laws that may apply to their activities. Careful evaluation of cloud service providers' security practices and liability clauses is critical in meeting these requirements.

# More natural SP800 questions/Out of scope


I don't know anything about the SP 800 series. Where should I start?

4.044587353710085

To begin understanding the SP (Special Publication) 800 series, you should focus on the following publications in this order, as they build upon each other and provide a comprehensive overview of security guidelines for various aspects of information systems:

1. **SP 800-53**: This publication outlines Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems (FISTS). It serves as the foundation for implementing security controls in federal IT systems, providing specific security requirements and recommendations to protect against threats and vulnerabilities.

2. **SP 800-16**: The IT Security Training Requirements from NIST provides guidance on creating an effective Information Technology (IT) Security Awareness and Training Program. It emphasizes the three types of training – awareness, training, and education – along with six functional security roles: manage, acquire, design and develop, implement and operate, review and evaluate, and use. This publication is essential for developing a structured approach to IT security training within your organization.

3. **SP 800-35**: The IT Security Learning Continuum from NIST SP 800-16 provides a three-dimensional array for integrating the types of training (awareness, training, and education), functional security roles, and levels of training (beginning, intermediate, and advanced). This publication complements your understanding of training requirements by offering guidance on designing an awareness and training program.

4. **SP 800-100**: Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200 specifies the minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems in seventeen security-related areas. Complement your understanding of IT security controls by learning about these fundamental requirements as specified by FIPS 200, which should be met using the security controls from NIST SP 800-53.

As you progress through these publications, take note of any specific practices or recommendations tailored to federal agencies, but don't limit your interpretation to that context; many concepts can be adapted and applied to other organizations as well. Remember that the overall aim is to build a strong security posture by implementing appropriate controls and training programs.

How long does it take to follow RMF?

4.252794419880956

The time required to complete the Risk Management Framework (RMF) process can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the size and complexity of the organization, the scope of the information systems being protected, existing security controls, and the need for new or updated controls. It's challenging to provide an exact duration as it can range from a few months to over a year in some cases.

Here is a general breakdown of time estimates per step:

1. Preparatory Step (Organizational Level): This phase involves assessing and understanding the organization, its security objectives, and the risk context. It typically takes around 3-6 months.

2. Security Category Determination: Approximately 1 month to finalize this step after completing the preparatory phase.

3. Select (Step 2 of RMF Process): This involves choosing appropriate security controls based on risk assessments and local conditions, which usually takes around 4-8 weeks once the organizational level is complete.

4. Implement (Step 3 of RMF Process): Organizations then designate, implement, document, and operate control configurations within their systems. Implementation can take anywhere from a few months to over a year depending on the complexity of the system and the number of controls implemented.

5. Assess (Step 4 of RMF Process): Performing the assessment and determining how well security controls are operational is an extensive process that might last between six to twelve months or more, contingent upon the size and intricacy of the organization's information systems.

6. Authorize: Senior management makes a risk-based decision to allow operations based on the assessment results. This can take several weeks once all other steps are complete.

7. Monitor (Step 6 of RMF Process): Continuous monitoring for effectiveness and tracking changes in security controls throughout system lifetime takes place as an ongoing activity, which requires dedicated resources and is typically managed by internal IT teams or external contractors.

In summary, the entire RMF process could take anywhere from one to four years, depending on how quickly organizations can progress through these steps after adequate preparatory work.
