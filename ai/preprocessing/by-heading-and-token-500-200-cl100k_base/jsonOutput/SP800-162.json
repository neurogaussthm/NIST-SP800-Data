        "content": "The concept of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) has existed for many years. It represents a point in the space of logical access control that includes access control lists, role-based access control, and the ABAC method for providing access based on the evaluation of attributes. Traditionally, access control has been based on the identity of a user requesting execution of a capability to perform an operation (e.g., read) on an object (e.g., a file), either directly, or through predefined attribute types such as roles or groups assigned to that user. Practitioners have noted that this approach to access control is often cumbersome to manage given the need to associate capabilities directly to users or their roles or groups. It has also been noted that the requester qualifiers of identity, groups, and roles are often insufficient in the expression of real-world access control policies. An alternative is to grant or deny user requests based on arbitrary attributes of the user and arbitrary attributes of the object, and environment conditions that may be globally recognized and more relevant to the policies at hand. This approach is often referred to as ABAC."

In December 2011, the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Plan v2.0 [FEDCIO2] took the next step of calling out ABAC as a recommended access control model for promoting information sharing between diverse and disparate organizations. In December 2012, the National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding included a Priority Objective that the Federal Government should extend and implement the FICAM Roadmap across Federal networks in all security domains.

These objects are owned by an individual or organization and have some inherent value that motivates those owners to protect them.

Individual privileges of the subject to perform operations (read, write, edit, delete, etc.) are managed on an individual basis by the object owner. Each object needs its own ACL and set of privileges assigned to each subject. In the IBAC model, the authorization decisions are made prior to any specific access request and result in the subject being added to the ACL. For each subject to be placed on an ACL, the object owner must evaluate identity, object, and context attributes against policy governing the object and decide whether to add the subject to the ACL. This decision is static and a notification process is required for the owner to reevaluate and perhaps remove a subject from the ACL to represent subject, object, or contextual changes.

While it is possible to achieve ABAC objectives using ACLs or RBAC, demonstrating AC requirements compliance is difficult and costly due to the level of abstraction required between the AC requirements and the ACL or RBAC model.

While cost savings can be incurred through no longer having to maintain existing solutions, it is possible that a large portion of that maintenance savings will be offset by the cost of managing and maintaining subject attributes and the policies needed for ABAC, as well as additional system support required.

Before the fact audit is often necessary to demonstrate compliance to specific regulations or directives. Another commonly desired review feature is determining who has access to a particular object or to the set of resources that are assigned to a particular object attribute. An ABAC system may not lend itself well to conducting these audits efficiently. Rather, a key feature of ABAC is the ability of the object owner to protect and share the object without any prior knowledge of individual subjects. Evaluating the set of subjects that have access to a given object requires a significant data retrieval and computation effort\u2014possibly requiring every object owner to run a simulation of the access control request for every known subject in the enterprise.

Note that the access control system basing an access decision on an NPE credential will not be able to attribute the request to the individual or individuals who may be acting in that role, or logged into the group account, at the time of the request. NPEs may act either independently or on behalf of an authenticated individual. NPEs may include network devices (e.g., switches, routers), processes running on servers (e.g., portals), workstations, and other endpoint devices. As mission and security functions are increasingly automated, NPEs will play a larger role as actors in authorization service interactions."

For each exchange, proof of origin, data integrity, and timeliness should be considered. For example, when the authorization service needs to obtain attributes from an authoritative attribute service, mutual authentication should be used, followed by mechanisms for validating message integrity and message origin. Authentication protocols based on strong methods (e.g., X.509 authentication) should be used to provide the level of assurance needed by both parties involved in the attribute exchange."
