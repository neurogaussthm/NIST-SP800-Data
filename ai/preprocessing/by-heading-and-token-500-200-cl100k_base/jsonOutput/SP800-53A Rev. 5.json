The procedures are customizable and can be easily tailored to provide organizations with the needed flexibility to conduct security and privacy control assessments that support organizational risk management processes and are aligned with the stated risk tolerance of the organization. Information on building effective security and privacy assessment plans is also provided with guidance on analyzing assessment results."

In addition to its comprehensive public review and vetting process, NIST collaborates with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) to establish and maintain a unified framework and common foundation for information security across the Federal Government. A common foundation and framework for information security provides the intelligence, defense, and civilian sectors of the Federal Government and their contractors more uniform and consistent ways to manage risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation that result from the operation and use of systems. A common foundation and framework also provides a strong basis for the reciprocal acceptance of security authorization decisions and facilitates information sharing. NIST also works with public and private sector entities to establish and maintain specific mappings and relationships between the security standards and guidelines developed by NIST, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)."

The degree to which organizations have come to depend upon systems to conduct routine, important, and critical mission and business functions means that the protection of the underlying systems and environments of operation is paramount to the success of the organization. The selection of appropriate security and privacy controls for a system is an important task that can have significant implications on the operations and assets of an organization as well as the welfare of individuals. Security controls are the safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for a system or an organization to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its system and information and to manage information security risk. Privacy controls are the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within a system or an organization to manage privacy risks and ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements."

Assessing related controls early in the assessment process may provide a basic understanding of the system that can aid in assessing other controls. In SP 800-53, the discussion section for each control identifies related controls that can provide useful information for organizing the assessment procedures. For example, AC-19 (Access Control for Mobile Devices) lists controls MP-4 (Media Storage) and MP-5 (Media Transport) as being related to AC-19.
