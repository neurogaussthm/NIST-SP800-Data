At each layer, the logical units are typically composed of a header and a payload. The payload consists of the information passed down from the previous layer, while the header contains layer-specific information such as addresses. At the application layer, the payload is the actual application data. The lowest layer sends the accumulated data through the physical network; the data is then passed up through the layers to its destination.

Proxying is a core function of an SSL portal VPN. The simplest form of an SSL portal VPN involves secure proxying of Web pages. The SSL portal VPN acts as a gateway by mediating the traffic between the user and the application. It receives the request from the user, connects to the Web server, downloads the information, and sends the information back to the user over the SSL connection. The proxy performs encryption or decryption and content inspection.# on each packet,\nwhich causes slightly slower performance."

Application translation uses proxying to interact with both sides of the connection with the appropriate protocol. SSL portal VPNs use application translation for applications that are not Web-enabled. This allows users to use a Web browser to access applications that do not have their own Web interfaces. For example, to provide file server access, an SSL portal VPN would communicate with a file server using the appropriate protocol, such as the Common Internet File System (CIFS) or the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and translate the information into a Web-based format so that users can view the information with a Web browser.

Users can connect to the network and access internal resources as if they were physically located on the internal local area network (LAN).

An SSL tunnel VPN network extension provides a secure connection from the user's system to an organization's network. This host-to-gateway tunnel can handle arbitrary traffic, much like a host-to-gateway IPsec VPN can. SSL tunnel VPN devices can support full or split tunneling. Full tunneling causes all network traffic to go through the tunnel to the organization. Split tunneling routes organization-specific traffic through the SSL VPN tunnel, but other traffic uses the remote user's default gateway. Network extension requires a client to be installed either as a plug-in in the user's Web browser or as a program on the user's system, which in turn requires administrative access to the local system. The client is typically an active content agent, so the system must have the ability to load the agent and the necessary privileges to run it. This can cause challenges on public systems, where users might not have those privileges, and on managed systems where security policy prevents such applets and controls. A more limited form of network extension is sometimes called port forwarding."

Both are inherent in SSL.\nAccess control. Access control permits or restricts access to applications at a granular level, such as per-user, per-group, and per-resource.\nEndpoint security controls. Endpoint security controls validate the security compliance of the client system that is attempting to use the SSL VPN. For example, host integrity checks may verify that firewall, malware detection, and antivirus software are enabled and running on the client system, and the host is up-to-date on its patches. Endpoint security controls also include security protection mechanisms, such as web browser cache cleaners, that remove sensitive information from client systems.\nIntrusion prevention. Intrusion prevention involves inspecting the data after it has been decrypted in the SSL VPN for potential attacks. It may also include anti-malware functionality to detect viruses, worms, and other malicious payloads and block or change network access rights based on the results of such checks."

As mentioned in Section 3.2, there are three main components to SSL VPNs: proxying, application translation, and network extension. Proxying is most often used to provide secure access to Web sites. Application translation uses proxying to translate an application into a format that is Web-enabled and accessible through a browser. Finally, network extension provides broad access to the internal network. The organization should decide how each resource should be accessed through the VPN. Proxying and application translation offer the most restrictive access because all communication takes place through the browser interface. Network extension is the easiest to use because users have full network access, but it should be used with discretion for this reason. A limited type of network extension, port forwarding, is sometimes used instead of full network extension. Port forwarding only creates tunnels for certain TCP or UDP ports instead of for all ports at one time. For example, a port forwarding system might tunnel HTTP traffic but not DNS traffic, leaving the DNS traffic outside of the VPN. Because port forwarding technology is a subset of network extension, this document discusses only network extension."

It is important to consider not only the performance of the primary SSL VPN components but also that of intermediate devices such as routers and firewalls. Encrypted traffic often consumes more processing power than unencrypted traffic, so it may cause bottlenecks. The additional resources necessitated by SSL vary widely based on several factors, including the encryption algorithm. Performance also involves the amount of time it takes to establish an SSL VPN session; this can be affected by the demands of the back-end authentication system (e.g., RADIUS, LDAP, AD) and also by the size of the keys in the server's certificate. Also, because traffic is encapsulated within an SSL connection, intermediate network devices may need to fragment packets, possibly slowing network activity. The typical solution for these types of problems is to reduce the size of the maximum transmission unit (MTU) value on the host originating the network traffic. The MTU is the maximum allowable packet size. The MTU might be able to be lowered by the network administrator so that SSL-encapsulated packets are not large enough to require fragmentation. In many cases, the best way to test the performance under load of a prototype implementation is to use simulated traffic generators on a live test network to mimic the actual characteristics of expected traffic as closely as possible. Testing should incorporate a variety of applications that will be used with the SSL VPN implementation, especially those most likely to be affected by network throughput or latency issues. Addressing performance problems generally involves upgrading or replacing hardware, using an SSL accelerator to offload SSL processing, or reducing processing demands (e.g., limiting the number of simultaneous users, limiting the amount of encrypted application traffic)."

The five phases of the approach are as follows:\nIdentify Requirements. Identify the requirements for remote access and determine how they can best be met.\nDesign the Solution. Make design decisions in five areas: access control, endpoint security, authentication methods, architecture, and cryptography policy.\nImplement and Test a Prototype. Test a prototype of the designed solution in a lab, test, or production environment to identify any potential issues.\nDeploy the Solution. Gradually deploy the SSL VPN solution throughout the enterprise, beginning with a pilot program.\n\nManage the Solution. Maintain the SSL VPN components and resolve operational issues. Repeat the planning and implementation process when significant changes need to be incorporated into the solution.\n\n\nThe organization should base its access control policy on its organizational requirements for remote access. These requirements stipulate which resources should be accessed by which groups or individuals. The access control policy could provide additional requirements and make access to resources dependent on other characteristics such as the authentication method used, computer type and location, and user identification.\n\n\nThe endpoint security policy specifies the host integrity checks that are performed before a host logs in. The policy also defines the checks that are performed after logout to guarantee the security of data that is downloaded during the VPN session.\n\n\nThe organization should select an authentication solution that is consistent with its security policy. The method of authentication can vary by user, group, or specific resource.\n\n\nThere are three main types of hardware configuration: a hardware appliance, an option to an existing security product, and a software solution. The hardware appliance configuration is the most common.\n\n\nThe placement of an SSL VPN device has potential security, functionality, and performance implications.# SSL VPN Considerations\n\n\nRouting policy is an important consideration, especially if the VPN implementation supports network extension, split tunneling, or multiple sites. It is recommended that NAT not be used so traffic to and from individual remote hosts can be tracked.\n\n\nSSL VPN devices vary widely in how they support load balancing and high availability, so the organization should select a device that supports its load balancing or high availability requirements.\n\n\nAlthough SSL VPNs are described as clientless, some forms of SSL VPN access such as network extension require dynamically downloaded agents to be run on the host."

In addition to the GRE connection, PPTP also establishes a separate control channel using TCP port 1723.\nMicrosoft has created its own PPP encryption mechanism for use with PPTP, Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE); it uses a 40-bit or 128-bit key with the RSA RC4 algorithm.
