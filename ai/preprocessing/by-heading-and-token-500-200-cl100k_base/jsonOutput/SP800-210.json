As shown in Figure 3, different cloud service models require the management of access to different components of the offered service. Since such cloud service models can be considered hierarchical, the AC considerations of functional components in a lower-level (according to Figure 2) service model (e.g., networking and storage layers in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model) are also applicable to the same functional components in a higher-level service model (e.g., networking and storage in Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) models). In general, AC considerations for IaaS are also applicable to PaaS and SaaS, and AC considerations for IaaS and PaaS are also applicable to SaaS. Thus, AC guidance for IaaS is applicable to PaaS and SaaS, and AC guidance for IaaS and PaaS is also applicable to SaaS. However, each service model has its own focus with regard to AC.

In this document, it is assumed that trust and federated identities/attributes are already established, and further discussion on that topic will be considered in another document. Regardless of the service model, consumers are entitled to be responsible for the security of their cloud-based data and, implicitly, of who has access to it [5]. For this reason, data is never controlled by cloud service providers but rather always stays with the cloud consumers. (The exception to this is log data, but consideration should still be given to how privacy and security is affected by such data.) Although a cloud service provider might become the custodian of consumers' data, it should not have access to that data. If a consumer's data is not encrypted, then cloud administrators might be able to read it. In such a case, the consumer's data should be identified (by the provider's access privileges to the data) and red-flagged as accessible by the service provider, and the consumer should be informed immediately."

Leasing VMs is more cost-effective than purchasing new physical machines. The virtualization technology is composed of VMs and a hypervisor, as shown in Figure 1. VMs are managed by the hypervisor, which controls the flow of data and instructions between the VMs and the physical hardware.

Moreover, end users might terminate the execution of their tasks before they are finished.

This approach might result in disclosing sensitive data required for evaluating the AC policies to the SaaS provider. Therefore, methods for enforcing authorization in the SaaS provider while not disclosing sensitive access control data to the SaaS provider should be considered.

For example, if the APIs do not require memory access for their tasks, then the AC policy for the APIs should enforce the non-memory access. Additionally, AC policies should be specified to manage the authorization process for web APIs. For example, when APIs connect through SOAP and REST protocols, the AC should control whether to allow end users to interface between Microsoft or non-Microsoft tools and technologies. For authorized API connections through Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Representational State Transfer (REST) protocols, the AC should grant all related access requested by the protocols.

Considering the attributes or roles of tenants is crucial when selecting the most suitable system. There are many ways to specify attributes or roles, such as in ABAC and RBAC models [31,32].
