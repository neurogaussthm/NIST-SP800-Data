Specifically, the evolution has taken two directions: one along the path of increasing storage media capacity (e.g., tape, Hard Disk Drives, solid-state drives (SSD)) and the other along the architectural front, starting from direct-attached storage (DAS) to the placement of storage resources in networks accessed through various interfaces and protocols to cloud-based storage resource access, which provides a software-based abstraction over all forms of background storage technologies. Accompanying the architectural evolution is the increase in management complexity, which subsequently increases the probability of configuration errors and associated security threats. This document provides an overview of the evolution of the storage technology landscape, current security threats, and the resultant risks. The main focus of this document is to provide a comprehensive set of security recommendations that will address the threats. The recommendations span not only security management areas that are common to an information technology (IT) infrastructure (e.g., physical security, authentication and authorization, change management, configuration control, and incident response and recovery) but also those specific to storage infrastructure (e.g., data protection, isolation, restoration assurance, and encryption)."

Just like computing and network technologies, storage technology has also evolved over the years. Higher capacity storage media and storage system architecture are the two fronts on which storage technology has evolved. The developments on the second front have enabled storage services to support many new and evolving computing use cases but have also introduced storage management complexity and many security challenges. Just like computing and networking, the current landscape of storage infrastructure consists of a mixture of legacy and advanced systems. With this in mind, this document provides an overview of the storage technology landscape, including traditional storage services (e.g., block, file, and object storage), storage virtualization, storage architectures designed for virtualized server environments, and storage resources hosted in the cloud. Descriptions of various threats to the storage resources are also included, as well as an analysis of the risks to storage infrastructure and the impacts of these threats."

One is the area of storage media, which features solid-state drives (SSD) with high capacity and storage efficiency features (e.g., deduplication, compression, etc.) compared to Hard Disk Drives (HDD).

The next evolution of storage infrastructure is one where the storage resources are intelligently pooled, located across the network, accessed through networking protocols, and accessible by multiple hosts or servers. This type of storage infrastructure is the only way that the data access needs of distributed systems can be supported, since application components that need to share data are in different nodes of a network. In this stage of evolution, the storage infrastructure has taken on two forms, depending on the type of networking protocol. In one form, the storage resource is simply a node in a network using common networking technology (e.g., local area network \u2013 LAN \u2013 or wide area network \u2013 WAN), while in the other, there is a dedicated network for communicating with all storage resources. An example of the former is network-attached storage (NAS), which provides file-level access to heterogeneous clients across a network using higher level protocols, such as network file system (NFS), or server message block / common internet file system (SMB/CIFS). The latter is exemplified by the storage area network (SAN), an implementation of which uses a specialized, high-speed network (e.g., Fibre-Channel) that\n```# Storage Infrastructure Overview"

Encryptions can have a range of weaknesses, from weak encryption algorithms and weak key generators to server-side vulnerabilities, leaked keys, fundamental design flaws or bugs, and backdoors [24]. It is not only important to use strong encryption, but to also properly secure the encryption keys. Changing encryption keys proactively can be part of a strategy to protect against compromised or insufficiently strong keys. When it comes to key generation, key strength, quality, and entropy play important roles, and keys should not be reused. Some attacks are based on exploiting random number generator weaknesses, including predictability or limited entropy, and the ability to disrupt it, so that it issues the same random number for key generation twice [25]."

Malware compromises a system, slowing down its basic functions and breaching its security. It can be used to steal data, control a device or system, and harvest the system's resources for illegal activities. Malware can infect a system in several ways; it can be transmitted via file sharing, downloading free software, email attachments, using compromised portable storage devices, and visiting infected websites [26]. Malware can be mistakenly installed on a storage management host and consequently cause harm such as credential theft, privilege escalation, data corruption, loss, or alteration, compromise of future backups, and more. In general, malware will use Operating System (OS) and other software vulnerabilities to install itself and perform various actions. The more common a software package, tool, or OS distribution is, the more likely it is that malware kits have already been published. For this reason, it would be easier to attack the storage management system than the storage device itself. This is not to say that storage devices are not a target \u2013 and indeed, the threat of using compromised images, firmware or microcode is of growing concern. Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts the stored data, rendering it unusable. The attacker then demands a ransom to restore access to the data upon payment.

In storage systems, this type of threat can result in a wide variety of risks, including data corruption, data alteration, data loss, and more.

For example, in section 4.1, \"Physical Storage Security\", primary identifiers are labeled PS-SS-R1, PS-SS-R2 etc. Secondary alphabetical identifiers ('(a)', '(b)', \u2026) are sometimes used within an individual guideline.

The security vulnerability in soft zoning is that the ports may be still accessible if the user in another zone correctly guesses the Fibre-Channel address. In this case, the FC switch will place a host WWN in a zone without evaluating the port numbers in the FC switch, which were used for connection. Port World-Wide Name (PWWN) identification is considered more secure than port number identification (used in hard zoning) because any device physically connected to a port could grant storage access to an unauthorized host.
