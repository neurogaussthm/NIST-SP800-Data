This ecosystem is composed of public and private sector entities (e.g., acquirers, suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers) that interact to research, develop, design, manufacture, acquire, deliver, integrate, operate, maintain, dispose of, and otherwise utilize or manage ICT/OT products and services.

This is especially true for those products and services developed for general-purpose applications and not tailored to the specific enterprise security or C-SCRM requirements.

Budgets must be requested and justified on a periodic basis. This process allows leadership and oversight officials to trace and measure the effectiveness and efficiency of allocated resources. This, in turn, serves as a driving function for program and operational C-SCRM personnel to track and manage their performance."
