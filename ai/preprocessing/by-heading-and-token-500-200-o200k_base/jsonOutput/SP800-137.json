When an ISCM program is first implemented, there will likely be several aspects of the organization's security program that are manually monitored. Organizations' monitoring capabilities will expand and mature over time. Metrics will evolve with lessons learned and with increased insight into organizational security status and risk tolerance. The focus of an ISCM strategy is to provide adequate information about security control effectiveness and organizational security status allowing organizational officials to make informed, timely security risk management decisions. Thus, implementation, effectiveness, and adequacy of all security controls are monitored along with organizational security status."

The monitoring frequency may vary for each requirement in accordance with the considerations discussed. For example, AC-2a involves the identification of account types. For a typical information system, once the account types have been identified and documented, they are not likely to change very often. For this reason, AC-2a is a candidate for relatively infrequent assessment. AC-2h involves the deactivation of temporary accounts and accounts of terminated or transferred users. Since personnel regularly come and go, a typical organization would most likely assess AC-2h on a more frequent basis than AC-2a. AC-2 (3) requires that the system automatically disable accounts after a specified time period of inactivity. As an automated control and one with typically high volatility, AC-2 (3) is a candidate for relatively frequent monitoring and also may serve to automate some of the base control requirements so that they can be monitored more frequently in accordance with the organizational ISCM strategy."

The information to be analyzed is provided to organizational officials in a variety of ways, such as recurring reports, automated reports, ad hoc reports, data feeds, and database views. Security-related information resulting from ISCM is analyzed in the context of stated risk tolerances, the potential impact that vulnerabilities may have on information systems, mission/business processes, and organization as a whole, and the potential impact of mitigation options. Even with real-time or near real-time organization-specific and system-specific security-related information, evolving vulnerability and threat data is always considered during the analysis. Organizational officials review the analyzed reports to determine whether to conduct mitigation activities or to transfer, avoid/reject, or accept risk. In some cases, authorizing officials may determine that accepting some specific risk is preferable to implementing a mitigating response. The rationale for such determinations may include organizational risk tolerance, negative impact to mission/business processes, or cost-effectiveness/return on investment of the implementation. Resolution of risk and the rationale for the decision is recorded in accordance with organizational policies and procedures."
