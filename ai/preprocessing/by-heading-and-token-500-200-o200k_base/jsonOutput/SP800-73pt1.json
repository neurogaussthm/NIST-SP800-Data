It specifies that these identity credentials must be stored on a smart card and that additional common identity credentials, known as derived PIV credentials, may be issued by a federal department or agency and used when a PIV Card is not practical. This document contains the technical specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve and use PIV identity credentials. The specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card functions. The goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card edge interface, and application programming interface. Moreover, this document enumerates requirements for the options and branches in international integrated circuit card standards. The specifications go further by constraining interpretations of the normative standards to ease implementation, facilitate interoperability, and ensure performance in a manner tailored for PIV applications."

In response, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201 [FIPS201], Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to define reliable, government-wide identity credentials for use in applications such as access to federally controlled facilities and information systems. FIPS 201 supports multiple types of authenticators, including authenticators on smart cards (also known as PIV Cards) and derived PIV credential authenticators in various other form factors. This publication contains technical specifications to interface with PIV Cards to retrieve and use identity credentials. Other specifications, such as NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-157r1 (Revision 1), contain procedures and life cycle activities to issue, maintain, and use derived PIV credentials."

The client application MAY then connect to the card and establish a virtual contact interface with it whenever the card is within read-range of the client application's contactless card reader without needing to prompt the cardholder."
