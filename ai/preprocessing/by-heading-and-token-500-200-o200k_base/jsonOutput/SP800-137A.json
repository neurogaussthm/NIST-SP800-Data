An ISCM program assessment provides organizational leadership with information on the effectiveness and completeness of the organization's ISCM program, including the review of ISCM strategies, policies, procedures, operations, and analysis of continuous monitoring data. The ISCM assessment approach can be used as presented or as the starting point for an organization-specific methodology.
