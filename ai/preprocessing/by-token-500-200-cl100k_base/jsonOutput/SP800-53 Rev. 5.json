  "# Abstract\n\nThis publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats and risks, including hostile attacks, human errors, natural disasters, structural failures, foreign intelligence entities, and privacy risks. The controls are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk. The controls address diverse requirements derived from mission and business needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Finally, the consolidated control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance perspective (i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the controls). Addressing functionality and assurance helps to ensure that information technology products and the systems that rely on those products are sufficiently trustworthy.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOrganizations must exercise due diligence in managing information security and privacy risk. This is accomplished, in part, by establishing a comprehensive risk management program that uses the flexibility inherent in NIST publications to categorize systems, select and implement security and privacy controls that meet mission and business needs, assess the effectiveness of the controls, authorize the systems for operation, and continuously monitor the systems. Exercising due diligence and implementing robust and comprehensive information security and privacy risk management programs can facilitate compliance with applicable laws, regulations, executive orders, and governmentwide policies. Risk management frameworks and risk management processes are essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the protection measures necessary to address stakeholder needs and the current threats to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based processes, procedures, methods, and technologies ensures that information systems and organizations have the necessary trustworthiness and resiliency to support essential mission and business functions, the U.S. critical infrastructure, and continuity of government.\n\n## COMMON SECURITY AND PRIVACY FOUNDATIONS\n\nIn working with the Office of Management and Budget to develop standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with federal agencies, state, local, and tribal governments, and private sector organizations to improve information security and privacy, avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort, and help ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and guidelines used for the protection of national security systems.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",
  "## COMMON SECURITY AND PRIVACY FOUNDATIONS\n\nIn working with the Office of Management and Budget to develop standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with federal agencies, state, local, and tribal governments, and private sector organizations to improve information security and privacy, avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort, and help ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and guidelines used for the protection of national security systems.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nIn addition to a comprehensive and transparent public review and comment process, NIST is engaged in a collaborative partnership with the Office of Management and Budget, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Defense, Committee on National Security Systems, Federal CIO Council, and Federal Privacy Council to establish a Risk Management Framework (RMF) for information security and privacy for the Federal Government. This common foundation provides the Federal Government and their contractors with cost-effective, flexible, and consistent ways to manage security and privacy risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The framework provides a basis for the reciprocal acceptance of security and privacy control assessment evidence and authorization decisions and facilitates information sharing and collaboration. NIST continues to work with public and private sector entities to establish mappings and relationships between the standards and guidelines developed by NIST and those developed by other organizations. NIST anticipates using these mappings and the gaps they identify to improve the control catalog.\n\n## DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES\n\nWith a renewed emphasis on the use of trustworthy, secure information systems and supply chain security, it is essential that organizations express their security and privacy requirements with clarity and specificity in order to obtain the systems, components, and services necessary for mission and business success. Accordingly, this publication provides controls in the System and Services Acquisition (SA) and Supply Chain Risk Management (SR) families that are directed at developers. The scope of the controls in those families includes information system, system component, and system service development and the associated developers whether the development is conducted internally by organizations or externally through the contracting and acquisition processes. The affected controls in the control catalog include SA-8, SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, SA-21, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-6, SR-7, SR-8, SR-9, and SR-11.",

SP 800-53B contains security and privacy control baselines for federal information systems and organizations. It provides guidance for tailoring control baselines and for developing overlays to support the security and privacy requirements of stakeholders and their organizations. CNSS Instruction 1253 provides control baselines and guidance for security categorization and security control selection for national security systems.\n\n## Use of Examples in This Publication\n\nThroughout this publication, examples are used to illustrate, clarify, or explain certain items in chapter sections, controls, and control enhancements. These examples are illustrative in nature and are not intended to limit or constrain the application of controls or control enhancements by organizations.\n\n## Federal Records Management Collaboration\n\nFederal records management processes have a nexus with certain information security and privacy requirements and controls. For example, records officers may be managing records retention, including when records will be deleted. Collaborating with records officers on the selection and implementation of security and privacy controls related to records management can support consistency and efficiency and ultimately strengthen the organization's security and privacy posture.\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nAs we push computers to \"the edge,\" building an increasingly complex world of connected information systems and devices, security and privacy will continue to dominate the national dialogue.

  "Revision 5 of this foundational NIST publication represents a multi-year effort to develop the next generation of security and privacy controls that will be needed to accomplish the above objectives. It includes changes to make the controls more usable by diverse consumer groups (e.g., enterprises conducting mission and business functions; engineering organizations developing information systems, IoT devices, and systems-of-systems; and industry partners building system components, products, and services). The most significant changes to this publication include:\n\n- Making the controls more outcome-based by removing the entity responsible for satisfying the control (i.e., information system, organization) from the control statement;\n- Integrating information security and privacy controls into a seamless, consolidated control catalog for information systems and organizations;\n- Establishing a new supply chain risk management control family;\n- Separating control selection processes from the controls, thereby allowing the controls to be used by different communities of interest, including systems engineers, security architects, software developers, enterprise architects, systems security and privacy engineers, and mission or business owners;\n- Removing control baselines and tailoring guidance from the publication and transferring the...# NIST SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations\n\n- Clarifying the relationship between requirements and controls and the relationship between security and privacy controls; and\n- Incorporating new, state-of-the-practice controls (e.g., controls to support cyber resiliency, support secure systems design, and strengthen security and privacy governance and accountability) based on the latest threat intelligence and cyber-attack data.\n\nIn separating the process of control selection from the controls and removing the control baselines, a significant amount of guidance and other informative material previously contained in SP 800-53 was eliminated.

Vast improvements in computing, storage, and communications are creating new opportunities for enhancing our social wellbeing; improving health and health care; eliminating barriers to education and employment; and increasing efficiencies in many sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture. The promise of these new applications often stems from their ability to create, collect, transmit, process, and archive information on a massive scale.

The controls can be implemented within any organization or system that processes, stores, or transmits information. The use of these controls is mandatory for federal information systems in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 [OMB A-130] and the provisions of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act [FISMA], which requires the implementation of minimum controls to protect federal information and information systems. This publication, along with other supporting NIST publications, is designed to help organizations identify the security and privacy controls needed to manage risk and to satisfy the security and privacy requirements in FISMA, the Privacy Act of 1974 [PRIVACT], OMB policies (e.g., [OMB A-130]), and designated Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), among others. It accomplishes this objective by providing a comprehensive and flexible catalog of security and privacy controls to meet current and future protection needs based on changing threats, vulnerabilities, requirements, and technologies. The publication also improves communication among organizations by providing a common lexicon that supports the discussion of security, privacy, and risk management concepts.\n\nFinally, the controls are independent of the process employed to select those.# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n## Controls",

The control selection criteria can be guided and informed by many factors, including mission and business needs, stakeholder protection needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and requirements to comply with federal laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. The combination of a catalog of security and privacy controls and a risk-based control selection process can help organizations comply with stated security and privacy requirements, obtain adequate security for their information systems, and protect the privacy of individuals.\n\n## 1.2 Target Audience\n\nThis publication is intended to serve a diverse audience, including:\n\n- Individuals with system, information security, privacy, or risk management and oversight responsibilities, including authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior agency information security officers, and senior agency officials for privacy;\n- Individuals with system development responsibilities, including mission owners, program managers, system engineers, system security engineers, privacy engineers, hardware and software developers, system integrators, and acquisition or procurement officials;\n- Individuals with logistical or disposition-related responsibilities, including program managers, procurement officials, system integrators, and property managers;\n- Individuals with security and privacy implementation and operations responsibilities, including mission or business owners, system owners, information owners or stewards, system administrators, continuity planners, and system security or privacy officers;\n- Individuals with security and privacy assessment and monitoring responsibilities, including auditors, Inspectors General, system evaluators, control assessors, independent verifiers and validators, and analysts; and\n- Commercial entities, including industry partners, producing component products and systems, creating security and privacy technologies, or providing services or capabilities that support information security or privacy.\n\n## 1.3 Organizational Responsibilities\n\nManaging security and privacy risks is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires:",

To develop a broadly applicable and technically sound set of controls for information systems and organizations, many sources were considered during the development of this publication. These sources included requirements and controls from the manufacturing, defense, financial, healthcare, transportation, energy, intelligence, industrial control, and audit communities as well as national and international standards organizations. In addition, the controls in this publication are used by the national security community in publications such as Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction No. 1253 [CNSSI 1253] to provide guidance specific to systems designated as national security systems. Whenever possible, the controls have been mapped to international standards to help ensure maximum usability and applicability. The relationship of this publication to other risk management, security, privacy, and publications can be found at [FISMA IMP].",
  "### 1.5 REVISIONS AND EXTENSIONS\nThe security and privacy controls described in this publication represent the state-of-the-practice protection measures for individuals, information systems, and organizations. The controls are reviewed and revised periodically to reflect the experience gained from using the controls; new or revised laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and standards; changing security and privacy requirements; emerging threats, vulnerabilities, attack and information processing methods; and the availability of new technologies. The security and privacy controls in the control catalog are also expected to change over time as controls are withdrawn, revised, and added. In addition to the need for change, the need for stability is addressed by requiring that proposed modifications to security and privacy controls go through a rigorous and transparent public review process to obtain public and private sector feedback and to build a consensus for such change. The review process provides a technically sound, flexible, and stable set of security and privacy controls for the organizations that use the control catalog.\n\n### 1.6 PUBLICATION ORGANIZATION\nThe remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:\n- Chapter Two describes the fundamental concepts associated with security and privacy controls, including the structure of the controls, how the controls are organized in the consolidated catalog, control implementation approaches, the relationship between security.```markdown\n# and privacy controls, and trustworthiness and assurance.\n\n- Chapter Three provides a consolidated catalog of security and privacy controls including a discussion section to explain the purpose of each control and to provide useful information regarding control implementation and assessment, a list of related controls to show the relationships and dependencies among controls, and a list of references to supporting publications that may be helpful to organizations.\n- References, Glossary, Acronyms, and Control Summaries provide additional information on the use of security and privacy controls.\n\n# CHAPTER TWO\n\n## THE FUNDAMENTALS\n\n### STRUCTURE, TYPE, AND ORGANIZATION OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROLS\n\nThis chapter presents the fundamental concepts associated with security and privacy controls, including the relationship between requirements and controls, the structure of controls, how controls are organized in the consolidated control catalog, the different control implementation approaches for information systems and organizations, the relationship between security and privacy controls, the importance of the concepts of trustworthiness and assurance for security and privacy controls, and the effects of the controls on achieving trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems.\n\n#### 2.1 REQUIREMENTS AND CONTROLS",
  "# CHAPTER TWO\n\n## THE FUNDAMENTALS\n\n### STRUCTURE, TYPE, AND ORGANIZATION OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROLS\n\nThis chapter presents the fundamental concepts associated with security and privacy controls, including the relationship between requirements and controls, the structure of controls, how controls are organized in the consolidated control catalog, the different control implementation approaches for information systems and organizations, the relationship between security and privacy controls, the importance of the concepts of trustworthiness and assurance for security and privacy controls, and the effects of the controls on achieving trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems.\n\n#### 2.1 REQUIREMENTS AND CONTROLS\n\nIt is important to understand the relationship between requirements and controls. For federal information security and privacy policies, the term requirement is generally used to refer to information security and privacy obligations imposed on organizations. For example, [OMB A130] imposes information security and privacy requirements with which federal agencies must comply when managing information resources. The term requirement can also be used in a broader sense to refer to an expression of stakeholder protection needs for a particular system or organization. Stakeholder protection needs and the corresponding security and privacy requirements may be derived from many sources (e.g., laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, mission and business needs, or risk assessments). The term requirement, as used in this guideline, includes both legal and policy requirements, as well as an expression of the broader set of stakeholder protection needs that may be derived from other sources. All of these requirements, when applied to a system, help determine the necessary characteristics of the system\u2014encompassing security, privacy, and assurance. Organizations may divide security and privacy requirements into more granular categories, depending on where the requirements are employed in the system development life cycle (SDLC) and for what purpose. Organizations may use the term capability requirement to describe a capability that the system or organization must provide to satisfy a stakeholder protection need. In addition, organizations may refer to system requirements that pertain to particular.\n```# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Hardware, Software, and Firmware Components\n\nHardware, software, and firmware components of a system as specification requirements\u2014that is, capabilities that implement all or part of a control and that may be assessed (i.e., as part of the verification, validation, testing, and evaluation processes). Finally, organizations may use the term statement of work requirements to refer to actions that must be performed operationally or during system development.",

Finally, organizations may use the term statement of work requirements to refer to actions that must be performed operationally or during system development.\n\n## Controls\n\nControls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and reflecting the protection needs of organizational stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented by the organization in order to satisfy the system requirements. Controls can include administrative, technical, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection and implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in the form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived requirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of implementation detail for particular controls within the SDLC.\n\n## 2.2 Control Structure and Organization\n\nSecurity and privacy controls described in this publication have a well-defined organization and structure. For ease of use in the security and privacy control selection and specification process, controls are organized into 20 families. Each family contains controls that are related to the specific topic of the family. A two-character identifier uniquely identifies each control family (e.g., PS for Personnel Security). Security and privacy controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision, manual processes, and automated mechanisms that are implemented by systems or actions by individuals.\n\n### Table 1\n\nTable 1 lists the security and privacy control families and their associated family identifiers. Families of controls contain base controls and control enhancements, which are directly related to their base controls. Control enhancements either add functionality or specificity to a base control or increase the strength of a base control. Control enhancements are used in systems and environments of operation that require greater protection than the protection provided by the base control. The need for organizations to select and implement control enhancements is due to the potential adverse organizational or individual impacts or when organizations require additions to the base control functionality or assurance based on assessments of risk. The selection and implementation of control enhancements always requires the selection and implementation of the base control.",
  "### Table 1\n\nTable 1 lists the security and privacy control families and their associated family identifiers. Families of controls contain base controls and control enhancements, which are directly related to their base controls. Control enhancements either add functionality or specificity to a base control or increase the strength of a base control. Control enhancements are used in systems and environments of operation that require greater protection than the protection provided by the base control. The need for organizations to select and implement control enhancements is due to the potential adverse organizational or individual impacts or when organizations require additions to the base control functionality or assurance based on assessments of risk. The selection and implementation of control enhancements always requires the selection and implementation of the base control.\n\nThe families are arranged in alphabetical order, while the controls and control enhancements within each family are in numerical order. The order of the families, controls, and control enhancements does not imply any logical progression, level of prioritization or.# Importance of Control Implementation\n\nThe order in which the controls or control enhancements are to be implemented reflects the order in which they were included in the catalog. Control designations are not re-used when a control is withdrawn.\n\n## Structure of Security and Privacy Controls\n\nSecurity and privacy controls have the following structure:\n\n- A base control section\n- A discussion section\n- A related controls section\n- A control enhancements section\n- A references section\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the structure of a typical control.\n\n### Control Section\n\nThe control section prescribes a security or privacy capability to be implemented. Security and privacy capabilities are achieved by the activities or actions, automated or non-automated, carried out by information systems and organizations. Organizations designate the responsibility for control development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring. Organizations have the flexibility to implement the controls selected in whatever manner that satisfies organizational mission or business needs consistent with law, regulation, and policy.\n\n### Discussion Section\n\nThe discussion section provides additional information about a control. Organizations can use the information as needed when developing, tailoring, implementing, assessing, or monitoring controls. The information provides important considerations for implementing controls based on mission or business requirements, operational environments, or assessments of risk. The additional information can also explain the purpose of controls and often includes examples. Control enhancements may also include a separate discussion section when the discussion information is applicable only to a specific control enhancement.\n\n### Related Controls Section",

The additional information can also explain the purpose of controls and often includes examples. Control enhancements may also include a separate discussion section when the discussion information is applicable only to a specific control enhancement.\n\n### Related Controls Section\n\nThe related controls section provides a list of controls from the control catalog that impact or support the implementation of a particular control or control enhancement, address a related security or privacy capability, or are referenced in the discussion section. Control enhancements are inherently related to their base control. Thus, related controls that are referenced in the base control are not repeated in the control enhancements. However, there may be related controls identified for control enhancements that are not referenced in the base control (i.e., the related control is only associated with the specific control enhancement). Controls may also be related to enhancements of other base controls. When a control is designated as a related control, a corresponding designation is made on that control in its source location in the catalog to illustrate the two-way relationship. Additionally, each control in a given family is inherently related to the -1 control (Policy and Procedures) in the same family. Therefore, the relationship between the -1 control and the other controls in the same family is not specified in the related controls section for each control.\n\n### Control Enhancements Section\n\nThe control enhancements section provides statements of security and privacy capability that augment a base control. The control enhancements are numbered sequentially within each.```markdown\n# Control Enhancements",
  "### Control Enhancements Section\n\nThe control enhancements section provides statements of security and privacy capability that augment a base control. The control enhancements are numbered sequentially within each.```markdown\n# Control Enhancements\n\nControl so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement the base control. Each control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended function or capability provided by the enhancement. In the AU-4 example, if the control enhancement is selected, the control designation becomes AU-4(1). The numerical designation of a control enhancement is used only to identify that enhancement within the control. The designation is not indicative of the strength of the control enhancement, level of protection, priority, degree of importance, or any hierarchical relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements are not intended to be selected independently. That is, if a control enhancement is selected, then the corresponding base control is also selected and implemented.\n\n## References Section\n\nThe references section includes a list of applicable laws, policies, standards, guidelines, websites, and other useful references that are relevant to a specific control or control enhancement. The references section also includes hyperlinks to publications for obtaining additional information for control development, implementation, assessment, and monitoring.\n\n## Flexibility in Controls\n\nFor some controls, additional flexibility is provided by allowing organizations to define specific values for designated parameters associated with the controls. Flexibility is achieved as part of a tailoring process using assignment and selection operations embedded within the controls and enclosed by brackets. The assignment and selection operations give organizations the capability to customize controls based on organizational security and privacy requirements. In contrast to assignment operations which allow complete flexibility in the designation of parameter values, selection operations narrow the range of potential values by providing a specific list of items from which organizations choose.\n\n## Determination of Parameters\n\nDetermination of the organization-defined parameters can evolve from many sources, including laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidance, and mission or business needs. Organizational risk assessments and risk tolerance are also important factors in determining the values for control parameters. Once specified by the organization, the values for the assignment and selection operations become a part of the control. Organization-defined control parameters used in the base controls also apply to the control enhancements associated with those controls. The implementation of the control is assessed for effectiveness against the completed control statement.\n\n## Additional Flexibility",

Organization-defined control parameters used in the base controls also apply to the control enhancements associated with those controls. The implementation of the control is assessed for effectiveness against the completed control statement.\n\n## Additional Flexibility\n\nIn addition to assignment and selection operations embedded in a control, additional flexibility is achieved through iteration and refinement actions. Iteration allows organizations to use a control multiple times with different assignment and selection values, perhaps being applied in different situations or when implementing multiple policies. For example, an organization may have multiple systems implementing a control but with different parameters established to...\n```# Addressing Different Risks\n\nAddress different risks for each system and environment of operation. Refinement is the process of providing additional implementation detail to a control. Refinement can also be used to narrow the scope of a control in conjunction with iteration to cover all applicable scopes (e.g., applying different authentication mechanisms to different system interfaces). The combination of assignment and selection operations and iteration and refinement actions when applied to controls provides the needed flexibility to allow organizations to satisfy a broad base of security and privacy requirements at the organization, mission and business process, and system levels of implementation.\n\n## Security as a Design Problem\n\n\"Providing satisfactory security controls in a computer system is\u2026 a system design problem.

The control implementation approaches define the scope of applicability for the control, the shared nature or inheritability of the control, and the responsibility for control development, implementation, assessment, and authorization. Each control implementation approach has a specific objective and focus that helps organizations select the appropriate controls, implement the controls in an effective manner, and satisfy security and privacy requirements. A specific control implementation approach may achieve cost benefits by leveraging security and privacy capabilities across multiple systems and environments of operation.\n\nCommon controls are controls whose implementation results in a capability that is inheritable by multiple systems or programs. A control is deemed inheritable when the system or program receives protection from the implemented control, but the control is developed, implemented, assessed, authorized, and monitored by an internal or external entity other than the entity responsible for the system or program. The security and privacy capabilities provided by common controls can be inherited from many sources, including mission or business lines, organizations, enclaves, environments of operation, sites, or other systems or programs. Implementing controls as common controls can introduce the risk of a single point of failure. Many of the controls needed to protect organizational information systems\u2014including many physical and environmental protection controls, personnel security controls, and incident# Response Controls",

Implementing controls as common controls can introduce the risk of a single point of failure. Many of the controls needed to protect organizational information systems\u2014including many physical and environmental protection controls, personnel security controls, and incident# Response Controls\n\nResponse controls are inheritable and, therefore, are good candidates for common control status. Common controls can also include technology-based controls, such as identification and authentication controls, boundary protection controls, audit and accountability controls, and access controls. The cost of development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring can be amortized across multiple systems, organizational elements, and programs using the common control implementation approach.\n\n## System-Specific and Hybrid Controls\n\nControls not implemented as common controls are implemented as system-specific or hybrid controls. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of the system owner and the authorizing official for a given system. Implementing system-specific controls can introduce risk if the control implementations are not interoperable with common controls. Organizations can implement a control as hybrid if one part of the control is common (inheritable) and the other part is system-specific.\n\nFor example, an organization may implement control CP-2 using a predefined template for the contingency plan for all organizational information systems with individual system owners tailoring the plan for system-specific uses, where appropriate. The division of a hybrid control into its common (inheritable) and system-specific parts may vary by organization, depending on the types of information technologies employed, the approach used by the organization to manage its controls, and assignment of responsibilities.\n\n## Responsibilities in Hybrid Controls",

Implementing controls as hybrid controls can introduce risk if the responsibility for the implementation and ongoing management of the common and system-specific parts of the controls is unclear.\n\n## Determining Control Implementation Approach\n\nThe determination as to the appropriate control implementation approach (i.e., common, hybrid, or system-specific) is context-dependent. The control implementation approach cannot be determined to be common, hybrid, or system-specific simply based on the language of the control. Identifying the control implementation approach can result in significant savings to organizations in implementation and assessment costs and a more consistent application of the controls organization-wide.\n\nTypically, the identification of the control implementation approach is straightforward. However, the implementation takes significant planning and coordination. Planning for the implementation approach of a control (i.e., common, hybrid, or system-specific) is best carried out early in the system development life cycle and coordinated with the entities providing the control [SP 800-37].

It is essential to examine the control parameters (e.g., assignment or selection operations) when determining if a common control is adequate to mitigate system-specific risks.\n\n## 2.4 SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROLS\n\nThe selection and implementation of security and privacy controls reflect the objectives of information security and privacy programs and how those programs manage their respective risks. Depending on the circumstances, these objectives and risks can be independent or overlapping. Federal information security programs are responsible for protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction (i.e., unauthorized activity or system behavior) to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Those programs are also responsible for managing security risk and for ensuring compliance with applicable security requirements. Federal privacy programs are responsible for managing risks to individuals associated with the creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, or disposal (collectively referred to as \"processing\") of PII and for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy requirements. When a system processes PII, the information security program and the privacy program have a shared responsibility for managing the security risks for the PII in the system. Due to this overlap in responsibilities, the controls that organizations select to manage these security risks will generally be the same regardless of their designation as security or privacy controls in control baselines or program or system plans.",
  "There also may be circumstances in which the selection and/or implementation of the control or control enhancement affects the ability of a program to achieve its objectives and manage its respective risks. The control discussion section may highlight specific security and/or privacy considerations so that organizations can take these considerations into account as they determine the most effective method to implement the control. However, these considerations are not exhaustive.\n\nFor example, an organization might select AU-3 (Content of Audit Records) to support monitoring for unauthorized access to an information asset that does not include PII. Since the potential loss of confidentiality of the information asset does not affect privacy, security objectives are the primary driver for the selection of the control. However, the implementation of the control with respect to monitoring for unauthorized access could involve the processing.\n```# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n## of PII which may result in privacy risks and affect privacy program objectives.\n\nThe discussion section in AU-3 includes privacy risk considerations so that organizations can take those considerations into account as they determine the best way to implement the control. Additionally, the control enhancement AU-3(3) (Limit Personally Identifiable Information Elements) could be selected to support managing these privacy risks. Due to permutations in the relationship between information security and privacy program objectives and risk management, there is a need for close collaboration between programs to select and implement the appropriate controls for information systems processing PII. Organizations consider how to promote and institutionalize collaboration between the two programs to ensure that the objectives of both disciplines are met and risks are appropriately managed.\n\n## 2.5 TRUSTWORTHINESS AND ASSURANCE\n\nThe trustworthiness of systems, system components, and system services is an important part of the risk management strategies developed by organizations. Trustworthiness, in this context, means worthy of being trusted to fulfill whatever requirements may be needed for a component, subsystem, system, network, application, mission, business function, enterprise, or other entity. Trustworthiness requirements can include attributes of reliability, dependability, performance, resilience, safety, security, privacy, and survivability under a range of potential adversity in the form of disruptions, hazards, threats, and privacy risks. Effective measures of trustworthiness are meaningful only to the extent that the requirements are complete, well-defined, and can be accurately assessed.",

Effective measures of trustworthiness are meaningful only to the extent that the requirements are complete, well-defined, and can be accurately assessed.\n\nTwo fundamental concepts that affect the trustworthiness of systems are functionality and assurance. Functionality is defined in terms of the security and privacy features, functions, mechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented within organizational systems and programs and the environments in which those systems and programs operate. Assurance is the measure of confidence that the system functionality is implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system\u2014thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate and enforce established security and privacy policies.\n\nIn general, the task of providing meaningful assurance that a system is likely to do what is expected of it can be enhanced by techniques that simplify or narrow the analysis by, for example, increasing the discipline applied to the system architecture, software design, specifications, code style, and configuration management. Security and privacy controls address functionality and assurance. Certain controls focus primarily on functionality while other controls focus primarily on assurance. Some controls can support functionality and assurance.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Organizations can select assurance-related controls to define system development activities\n\nOrganizations can select assurance-related controls to define system development activities, generate evidence about the functionality and behavior of the system, and trace the evidence to the system elements that provide such functionality or exhibit such behavior. The evidence is used to obtain a degree of confidence that the system satisfies the stated security and privacy requirements while supporting the organization's mission and business functions. Assurance-related controls are identified in the control summary tables in Appendix C.\n\n## EVIDENCE OF CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION",

The controls are designed to facilitate risk management and compliance with applicable federal laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and standards. With few exceptions, the security and privacy controls in the catalog are policy-, technology-, and sector-neutral, meaning that the controls focus on the fundamental measures necessary to protect information and the privacy of individuals across the information life cycle.\n\nWhile the security and privacy controls are largely policy-, technology-, and sector-neutral, that does not imply that the controls are policy-, technology-, and sector-unaware. Understanding policies, technologies, and sectors is necessary so that the controls are relevant when they are implemented. Employing a policy-, technology-, and sector-neutral control catalog has many benefits. It encourages organizations to:\n\n- Focus on the security and privacy functions and capabilities required for mission and business success and the protection of information and the privacy of individuals, irrespective of the technologies that are employed in organizational systems;\n- Analyze each security and privacy control for its applicability to specific technologies, environments of operation, mission and business functions, and communities of interest; and\n- Specify security and privacy policies as part of the tailoring process for controls that have variable parameters.",

Federal Information Processing Standards, Special Publications, and Interagency/Internal Reports provide guidance on selecting security and privacy controls that reduce risk for specific technologies and sector-specific applications, including smart grid, cloud, healthcare, mobile, industrial control systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. NIST publications are cited as references as applicable to specific controls in Sections 3.1 through 3.20.\n\nSecurity and privacy controls in the catalog are expected to change over time as controls are withdrawn, revised, and added. To maintain stability in security and privacy plans, controls are not renumbered each time a control is withdrawn. Rather, notations of the controls that have been withdrawn are maintained in the control catalog for historical purposes. Controls may be withdrawn for a variety of reasons, including when the function or capability provided by the control has been incorporated into another control, the control is redundant to an existing control, or the control is deemed to be no longer necessary or effective.",

In addition, new controls are developed based on a better understanding of how to mitigate information security risks to systems and organizations and risks to the privacy of individuals arising from information processing. Finally, new controls are developed based on new or changing requirements in laws, executive orders, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines. Proposed modifications to the controls are carefully analyzed during each revision cycle, considering the need for stability of controls and the need to be responsive to changing technologies, threats, vulnerabilities, types of attack, and processing methods. The objective is to adjust the level of information security and privacy over time to meet the needs of organizations and individuals.\n\n## 3.1 ACCESS CONTROL\n\nQuick link to Access Control Summary Table\n\n### AC-1 POLICY AND PROCEDURES\n\n**Control:**\n\na.

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.",

Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts.\n\nWhere access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific conditions for group and role membership; specify authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for each account; and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point of origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements and mission/business requirements.

While user identities remain relatively constant over time, user privileges typically change more frequently based on ongoing mission or business requirements and the operational needs of organizations. An example of dynamic privilege management is the immediate revocation of privileges from users as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user privileges if they are operating out of their normal work times, if their job function or assignment changes, or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations. Dynamic privilege management includes the effects of privilege changes, for example, when there are changes to encryption keys used for communications.\n\n**Related Controls:** AC-16.\n\n## (7) Account Management | Privileged User Accounts\n\n(a) Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with [Selection: a role-based access scheme; an attribute-based access scheme];\n(b) Monitor privileged role or attribute assignments;\n(c) Monitor changes to roles or attributes; and\n(d) Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer appropriate.",

This prevents the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects.\n\nMandatory access control policies constrain actions that subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to which the system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented. This enforcement is provided by an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept as described in AC-25.

For example, while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint that prevents a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different impact or classification level, AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any other subject with the same impact or classification level as the subject.

Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing the information to other subjects or objects (i.e., subjects have the discretion to pass). Discretionary access control can operate in conjunction with mandatory access control as described in AC-3(3) and AC-3(15). A subject that is constrained in its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under the less rigorous constraints of discretionary access control. Therefore, while AC-3(3) imposes constraints that prevent a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different impact or classification level, AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same impact or classification level. The policy is bounded by the system. Once the information is passed outside of system control, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect.

  "## Related Controls: None.\n\n### (5) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY-RELEVANT INFORMATION\nPrevent access to [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant information] except during secure, non-operable system states.\n\n**Discussion:** Security-relevant information is information within systems that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce system security and privacy policies or maintain the separation of code and data. Security-relevant information includes access control lists, filtering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, and cryptographic key management information. Secure, non-operable system states include the times in which systems are not performing mission or business-related processing, such as when the system is offline for maintenance, boot-up, troubleshooting, or shut down.\n\n**Related Controls:** CM-6, SC-39.\n\n### (6) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | PROTECTION OF USER AND SYSTEM INFORMATION\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-4 and SC-28.]\n\n### (7) ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL\nEnforce a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and objects and control access based upon [Assignment: organization-defined roles and users authorized to assume such roles].\n\n**Discussion:** Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that enforces access to objects and system functions based on the defined role (i.e., job function) of the subject. Organizations can create specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with the organization-defined roles. When users are assigned to specific roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a large number of individuals) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can also increase privacy and security risk if individuals assigned to a role are given access to information beyond what they need to support organizational missions or business functions. RBAC can be implemented as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For organizations implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3(3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.\n\n**Related Controls:** None.",

Revocation based on changes to security labels may take effect immediately. Organizations provide alternative approaches on how to make revocations immediate if systems cannot provide such capability and immediate revocation is necessary.\n**Related Controls:** None.\n\n## (9) Access Enforcement | Controlled Release\nRelease information outside of the system only if:\n(a) The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined system or system component] provides [Assignment: organization-defined controls]; and\n(b) [Assignment: organization-defined controls] are used to validate the appropriateness of the information designated for release.\n\n**Discussion:** Organizations can only directly protect information when it resides within the system. Additional controls may be needed to ensure that organizational information is adequately protected once it is transmitted outside of the system. In situations where the system is unable to determine the adequacy of the protections provided by external entities, as a mitigation measure, organizations procedurally determine whether the external systems are providing adequate controls. The means used to determine the adequacy of controls provided by external systems include conducting periodic assessments (inspections/tests), establishing agreements between the organization and its counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to protect the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security and privacy policy to protect the information and individuals' privacy.",

For example, if the system passes information to a system controlled by another organization, technical means are employed to validate that the security and privacy attributes associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the system passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to the printer.\n**Related Controls:** CA-3, PT-7, PT-8, SA-9, SC-16.\n\n## (10) Access Enforcement | Audited Override of Access Control Mechanisms\nEmploy an audited override of automated access control mechanisms under [Assignment: organization-defined conditions] by [Assignment: organization-defined roles].\n\n**Discussion:** In certain situations, such as when there is a threat to human life or an event that threatens the organization's ability to carry out critical missions or business functions, an override capability for access control mechanisms may be needed.

Organizations can create rules based on attributes and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with organization-defined attributes and rules. When users are assigned to attributes defined in attribute-based access control policies or rules, they can be provisioned to a system with the appropriate privileges or dynamically granted access to a protected resource. Attribute-based access control can be implemented as either a mandatory or discretionary form of access control.

Access helps individuals to develop an understanding about how their personally identifiable information is being processed. It can also help individuals ensure that their data is accurate. Access mechanisms can include request forms and application interfaces. For federal agencies, [PRIVACT] processes can be located in systems of record notices and on agency websites. Access to certain types of records may not be appropriate (e.g., for federal agencies, law enforcement records within a system of records may be exempt from disclosure under the [PRIVACT]) or may require certain levels of authentication assurance.

Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content.

Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and/or inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.\n\nControl enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-domain solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf products.

Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to respond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is exceeded.

Device locks can be implemented at the operating system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be used to initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle).

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated without terminating network sessions. Session termination ends all processes associated with a user's logical session except for those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.

Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may, under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational systems without identification and authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can be \"none.\"\n\n### Related Controls\n\nAC-8, IA-2, PL-2.\n\n### Control Enhancements\n\nNone.\n\n## AC-15 AUTOMATED MARKING\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-3.]\n\n## AC-16 SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES\n\n### Control\n\na.

Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques play important parts in the trust that organizations have in the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by organizations.

Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization.

External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and systems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of external systems (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).

These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.\n\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope of AC-20. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and conditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.\n\n## Related Controls:\nAC-2, AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-3, PL-2, PL-4, SA-9, SC-7.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\n\n### (1) USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS | LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE\nPermit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only after:\n- (a) Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in the organization's security and privacy policies and security and privacy plans; or\n- (b) Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external system.\n\n**Discussion:** Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances where individuals using external systems may need to access organizational systems.

Data storage objects include database records and database fields. Sensitive information can be extracted from data mining operations. When information is personally identifiable information, it may lead to unanticipated revelations about individuals and give rise to privacy risks. Prior to performing data mining activities, organizations determine whether such activities are authorized. Organizations may be subject to applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that address data mining requirements. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding such requirements.\n\nData mining prevention and detection techniques include limiting the number and frequency of database queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of databases, limiting types of responses provided to database queries, applying differential privacy techniques or homomorphic encryption, and notifying personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur. Data mining protection focuses on protecting information from data mining while such information resides in organizational data stores.

In such instances, authorization\ninformation is transmitted securely (e.g., using cryptographic mechanisms) so that timely\naccess control decisions can be enforced at the appropriate locations. To support the access\ncontrol decisions, it may be necessary to transmit as part of the access authorization\ninformation supporting security and privacy attributes. This is because in distributed\nsystems, there are various access control decisions that need to be made, and different entities\nmake these decisions in a serial fashion, each requiring those attributes to make the\ndecisions.

A reference validation mechanism is always\ninvoked, tamper-proof,\nand small enough to be subject to analysis and tests, the completeness of which\ncan be assured\n(i.e., verifiable). Information is represented internally within systems using\nabstractions known as\ndata structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of\nentities, both active and\npassive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are associated with\nindividuals, devices, or\nprocesses acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as\nobjects, are associated\nwith data structures, such as records, buffers, communications ports, tables,\nfiles, and inter-process pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control\npolicies that restrict access to objects\nbased on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The\nsystem enforces\nthe access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The\ntamper-proof\nproperty of the reference monitor prevents determined adversaries from\ncompromising the\nfunctioning of the reference validation mechanism. The always invoked property\nprevents\nadversaries from bypassing the mechanism and violating the security policy.

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of awareness and training policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to awareness and training policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\n\n## Related Controls\n- PM-9\n- PS-8\n- SI-12\n\n## Control Enhancements\nNone.\n\n## References\n- [OMB A-130]\n- [SP 800-12]\n- [SP 800-30]\n- [SP 800-39]\n- [SP 800-50]\n- [SP 800-100]\n\n# AT-2 Literacy Training and Awareness",

The types of events that require logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the privacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or privacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action changes, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are operational and supported by the system.\n\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization. Organizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals.# Event Logging and Audit Records",

These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1), CM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.\n\nAudit records can be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.",

Rather, integrated analysis requires that the analysis of information generated by scanning, monitoring, or other data collection activities is integrated with the analysis of audit record information. Security Information and Event Management tools can facilitate audit record aggregation or consolidation from multiple system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans of the system and in correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can uncover denial-of-service attacks or other types of attacks that result in the unauthorized use of resources.

Such information can lead to a directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Organizations limit access to information that is available from nontechnical sources due to its sensitive nature. Limited access minimizes the potential for inadvertent release of privacy-related information to individuals who do not have a need to know. The correlation of information from nontechnical sources with audit record information generally occurs only when individuals are suspected of being involved in an incident.

Audit record reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same system or from the same organizational entities that conduct audit logging activities. The audit record reduction capability includes modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records.

  "## organization-defined events\n\n### Discussion:\nAssessment, authorization, and monitoring policy and procedures address the controls in the CA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

Assessments can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of systems engineering and systems security engineering processes. The design for controls can be assessed as RFPs are developed, responses assessed, and design reviews conducted. If a design to implement controls and subsequent implementation in accordance with the design are assessed during development, the final control testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing previously completed control assessment and aggregating the outcomes.\n\nOrganizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment plan for the system or maintain separate plans.

Impartiality means that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation, sustainment, or management of the systems under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations.\n\nAuthorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of systems and/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. Assessor independence determination includes whether contracted assessment services have sufficient independence, such as when system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of the assessors conducting the assessments. During the system design and development phase, having independent assessors is analogous to having independent SMEs involved in design reviews. When organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the organizations require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of the system owners, independence in...\n```# Assessment\n\nProcesses can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results.

Instead, the interface characteristics between the systems (e.g., how the information is being exchanged, how the information is protected) are described in the respective security and privacy plans. If the systems that exchange information have different authorizing officials within the same organization, the organizations can develop agreements or provide the same information that would be provided in the appropriate agreement type from CA-3a in the respective security and privacy plans for the systems.

Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational systems and common controls or assume responsibility for the mission and business functions supported by those systems or common controls. The authorization process is a federal responsibility, and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Authorizing officials are both responsible and accountable for security and privacy risks associated with the operation and use of organizational systems. Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes to authorize systems and senior officials that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities.\n\nAuthorizing officials issue ongoing authorizations of systems based on evidence produced from implemented continuous monitoring programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs reduce the need for separate reauthorization processes. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, the information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security and privacy plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis. This provides authorizing officials, common control providers, and system owners with an up-to-date status of the security and privacy posture of their systems, controls, and operating environments. To reduce the cost of reauthorization, authorizing officials can leverage the results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.\n\n## Related Controls:\n\nCA-2, CA-3, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10, RA-3, SA-10, SI-12.",

As a result, policies for selecting and implementing controls may be inconsistent, and the controls could fail to work together in a consistent or coordinated manner. At a minimum, the lack of consistency and coordination could mean that there are unacceptable security and privacy gaps in the system. At worst, it could mean that some of the controls implemented in one location or by one component are actually impeding the functionality of other controls (e.g., encrypting internal network traffic can impede monitoring). In other situations, failing to consistently monitor all implemented network protocols (e.g., a dual stack of IPv4 and IPv6) may create unintended vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited by adversaries. It is important to validate\u2014through testing, monitoring, and analysis\u2014that the implemented controls are operating in a consistent, coordinated, non-interfering manner.\n\n### Related Controls\n\nNone.\n\n----\n\n# Continuous Monitoring | Automation Support for Monitoring\n\nEnsure the accuracy, currency, and availability of monitoring results for the system using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].\n\n## Discussion\n\nUsing automated tools for monitoring helps to maintain the accuracy,# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Currency\nand availability of monitoring information which in turns helps to increase the level of ongoing awareness of the system security and privacy posture in support of organizational risk management decisions.",

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of configuration management policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents.

For example, organizations can take actions for notebook computers used by individuals departing on and returning from travel. Actions include determining the locations that are of concern, defining the required configurations for the components, ensuring that components are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying controls to the components after travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and more stringent configuration settings. Controls applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include examining the mobile device for signs of physical tampering and purging and reimaging disk drives.

Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations, configuration items of systems, operational procedures, configuration settings for system components, remediate vulnerabilities, and unscheduled or unauthorized changes. Processes for managing configuration changes to systems include Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards that review and approve proposed changes. For changes that impact privacy risk, the senior agency official for privacy updates privacy impact assessments and system of records notices. For new systems or major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from the development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities before and after changes are made to systems and the auditing activities required to implement such changes.

Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders are routinely provided under software license agreements that permit individuals to study, change, and improve the software. From a security perspective, the major advantage of open-source software is that it provides organizations with the ability to examine the source code. In some cases, there is an online community associated with the software that inspects, tests, updates, and reports on issues found in software on an ongoing basis. However, remediating vulnerabilities in open-source software may be problematic. There may also be licensing issues associated with open-source software, including the constraints on derivative use of such software. Open-source software that is available only in binary form may increase the level of risk in using such software.\n\n### Related Controls\nSI-7.\n\n### References\nNone.\n\n## CM-11 User-Installed Software\n\n### Control\na.

The processing of such information encompasses the full information life cycle, which includes collection, generation, transformation, use, disclosure, retention, and disposal. A map of system data actions includes discrete data actions, elements of personally identifiable information being processed in the data actions, system components involved in the data actions, and the owners or operators of the system components. Understanding what personally identifiable information is being processed (e.g., the sensitivity of the personally identifiable information), how personally identifiable information is being processed (e.g., if the data action is visible to the individual or is processed in another part of the system), and by whom (e.g., individuals may have different privacy perceptions based on the entity that is processing the personally identifiable information) provides a number of contextual factors that are important to assessing the degree of privacy risk created by the system. Data maps can be illustrated in different ways, and the level of detail may vary based on the mission and business needs of the organization. The data map may be an overlay of any system design artifact that the organization is using. The development of this map may necessitate coordination between the privacy and security programs regarding the covered data actions and the components that are identified as part of the system.\n\n## Related Controls\nAC-3, CM-4, CM-12, PM-5, PM-27, PT-2, PT-3, RA-3, RA-8.\n\n# CM-14 SIGNED COMPONENTS",

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of contingency planning policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to contingency planning policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.",

Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level. Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling.# Activities and Organizations\n\nEnsure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident.

Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities for returning systems to fully operational states. Recovery and reconstitution operations reflect mission and business priorities; recovery point, recovery time, and reconstitution objectives; and organizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes the deactivation of interim system capabilities that may have been needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully restored system capabilities, reestablishment of continuous monitoring activities, system reauthorization (if required), and activities to prepare the system and organization for future disruptions, breaches, compromises, or failures. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities can include automated mechanisms and manual procedures. Organizations establish recovery time and recovery point objectives as part of contingency planning.\n\n### Related Controls\n\n- CP-2\n- CP-4\n- CP-6\n- CP-7\n- CP-9\n- IR-4\n- SA-8\n- SC-24\n- SI-13\n\n## Control Enhancements\n\n### (1) SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION | CONTINGENCY PLAN TESTING\n\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CP-4.]",

Organizational users include employees or individuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g., contractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to all accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user identities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is obtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks.```markdown\n# The use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network.\n\nIdentification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users are described in IA-8.",

Multi-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or the Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC). In addition to authenticating users at the system level (i.e., at logon), organizations may employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e., local, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options appropriate for the level of risk.

To address this threat, organizations may employ specific techniques or mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior. Suspicious behavior may include accessing information that individuals do not typically access as part of their duties, roles, or responsibilities; accessing greater quantities of information than individuals would routinely access; or attempting to access information from suspicious network addresses. When pre-established conditions or triggers occur, organizations can require individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use for adaptive authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the number or types of records being accessed. Adaptive authentication does not replace and is not used to avoid the use of multi-factor authentication mechanisms but can augment implementations of multi-factor authentication.\n\n### Related Controls:\nIA-2, IA-8.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\nNone.\n\n### References:\n[SP 800-63-3].\n\n# IA-11 RE-AUTHENTICATION\n\n## Control:\nRequire users to re-authenticate when [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances or situations requiring re-authentication].\n\n## Discussion:\nIn addition to the re-authentication requirements associated with device locks, organizations may require re-authentication of individuals in certain situations, including when roles, authenticators or credentials change, when security categories of systems change, when the execution of privileged functions occurs, after a fixed time period, or periodically.\n\n### Related Controls:\nAC-3, AC-11, IA-2, IA-3, IA-4, IA-8.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\nNone.\n\n### References:\nNone.\n\n# IA-12 IDENTITY PROOFING",

Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events].\n\n### Discussion\nIncident response policy and procedures address the controls in the IR family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of incident response policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to incident response policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\n\n### Related Controls\nPM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\n\n### Control Enhancements\nNone.\n\n### References\n[OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-50], [SP 800-61], [SP 800-83], [SP 800-100].\n\n## IR-2 INCIDENT RESPONSE TRAINING\n\n### Control\na.

The incident handling capability includes performing rapid forensic preservation of evidence and analysis of and response to intrusions. For some organizations, the incident response team can be a cross-organizational entity.\n\nAn integrated incident response team facilitates information sharing and allows organizational personnel (e.g., developers, implementers, and operators) to leverage team knowledge of the threat and implement defensive measures that enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, integrated teams promote the rapid detection of intrusions, the development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing cyber intelligence development. Integrated incident response teams are better able to identify adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures that are linked to the operations tempo or specific mission and business functions and to define responsive actions in a way that does not disrupt those mission and business functions.

The purpose of the SOC is to defend and monitor an organization's systems and networks (i.e., cyber infrastructure) on an ongoing basis. The SOC is also responsible for detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner. The organization staffs the SOC with skilled technical and operational personnel (e.g., security analysts, incident response personnel, systems security engineers) and implements a combination of technical, management, and operational controls (including monitoring, scanning, and forensics tools) to monitor, fuse, correlate, analyze, and respond to threat and security-relevant event data from multiple sources. These sources include perimeter defenses, network devices (e.g., routers, switches), and endpoint agent data feeds. The SOC provides a holistic situational awareness capability to help organizations determine the security posture of the system and organization. A SOC capability can be obtained in a variety of ways. Larger organizations may implement a dedicated SOC while smaller organizations may employ third-party organizations to provide such a capability.\n\n### Related Controls\nNone.",

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of maintenance policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to maintenance policy and procedures assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\n\n### Related Controls\n- PM-9\n- PS-8\n- SI-12.\n\n### Control Enhancements\nNone.\n\n### References\n- [OMB A-130]\n- [SP 800-12]\n- [SP 800-30]\n- [SP 800-39]\n- [SP 800-100].\n\n## MA-2 CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE",

Organizations have flexibility in determining roles for the approval of maintenance tools and how that approval is documented. A periodic review of maintenance tools facilitates the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-used tools. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items and may be pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media, cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. Such tools can be vehicles for transporting malicious code, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into systems. Maintenance tools can include hardware and software diagnostic test equipment and packet sniffers.# Maintenance Tools\n\nHardware and software components that support maintenance and are a part of the system (including the software implementing utilities such as \"ping,\" \"ls,\" \"ipconfig,\" or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch) are not addressed by maintenance tools.\n\n**Related Controls:** MA-2, PE-16.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\n\n### (1) MAINTENANCE TOOLS | INSPECT TOOLS\nInspect the maintenance tools used by maintenance personnel for improper or unauthorized modifications.",

The primary goal of preventive maintenance is to avoid or mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn components before they fail.

The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a scheduled time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the objective of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition. The predictive maintenance approach employs principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are performed while equipment is in service, thus minimizing disruption of normal system operations.

Examples include digital media in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, mobile devices, and non-digital media (e.g., paper and microfilm). The sanitization process removes information from system media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques\u2014including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, de-identification of personally identifiable information, and destruction\u2014prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media that contains information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable or information deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes destruction, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document.

  "Physical and environmental protection policy and procedures address the controls in the PE family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of physical and environmental protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents.

Examples of physical access monitoring include the employment of guards, video surveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can help identify suspicious activity, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be supported by audit logging controls, such as AU-2, if the access logs are part of an automated system. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security incidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious physical access activities. Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal work hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence accesses.\n\n## Related Controls\nAU-2, AU-6, AU-9, AU-12, CA-7, CP-10, IR-4, IR-8.\n\n## Control Enhancements\n\n### (1) MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS | INTRUSION ALARMS AND SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT\nMonitor physical access to the facility where the system resides using physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.\n\n#### Discussion\nPhysical intrusion alarms can be employed to alert security personnel when unauthorized access to the facility is attempted.

A UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut down the system.\n\n**Related Controls:** AT-3, CP-2, CP-7.\n\n### Control Enhancements:\n#### (1) EMERGENCY POWER | ALTERNATE POWER SUPPLY \u2013 MINIMAL OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY\nProvide an alternate power supply for the system that is activated [Selection: manually; automatically] and that can maintain minimally required operational capability in the event of an extended loss of the primary power source.\n\n**Discussion:** Provision of an alternate power supply with minimal operating capability can be satisfied by accessing a secondary commercial power supply or other external power supply.\n\n**Related Controls:** None.",

The control documentation describes how system-specific and hybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of the system.\n\nSystem security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development of systems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy engineering processes. System security and privacy plans are living documents that are updated and adapted throughout the system development life cycle (e.g., during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for proposal, and design reviews).\n\n## Requirements\n\nSection 2.1 describes the different types of requirements that are relevant to organizations during the system development life cycle and the relationship between requirements and controls. Organizations may develop a single, integrated security and privacy plan or maintain separate plans.\n\nSecurity and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to a set of controls and control enhancements. The plans describe how the controls and control enhancements meet the security and privacy requirements but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls and control enhancements.\n\nSecurity and privacy plans contain sufficient information (including specifications of control parameter values for selection and assignment operations explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented.\n\n## Document Structure\n\nSecurity and privacy plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a collection of various documents, including documents that already exist. Effective security and privacy plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents, including design and implementation specifications where more detailed information can be obtained.",

The architectures include an architectural description, the allocation of security and privacy functionality (including controls), security- and privacy-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. The architectures can also include other information, such as user roles and the access privileges assigned to each role; security and privacy requirements; types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system; supply chain risk management requirements; restoration priorities of information and system services; and other protection needs.\n\n[SP 800-160-1] provides guidance on the use of security architectures as part of the system development life cycle process. [OMB M-19-03] requires the use of the systems security engineering concepts described in [SP 800-160-1] for high value assets. Security and privacy architectures are reviewed and updated throughout the system development life cycle, from analysis of alternatives through review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses to the design reviews before and during implementation (e.g., during preliminary design reviews and critical design reviews).",

Security and privacy architectures are reviewed and updated throughout the system development life cycle, from analysis of alternatives through review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses to the design reviews before and during implementation (e.g., during preliminary design reviews and critical design reviews).\n\nIn today's modern computing architectures, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy architectures is necessary for developing a comprehensive mission and business.# Protection Strategy\n\nEstablishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control a baseline configuration for organizational systems is critical to implementing and maintaining effective architectures. The development of the architectures is coordinated with the senior agency information security officer and the senior agency official for privacy to ensure that the controls needed to support security and privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. In many circumstances, there may be no distinction between the security and privacy architecture for a system. In other circumstances, security objectives may be adequately satisfied, but privacy objectives may only be partially satisfied by the security requirements. In these cases, consideration of the privacy requirements needed to achieve satisfaction will result in a distinct privacy architecture. The documentation, however, may simply reflect the combined architectures.\n\n## PL-8\n\nPL-8 is primarily directed at organizations to ensure that architectures are developed for the system and, moreover, that the architectures are integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at the external information technology product and system developers and integrators.

Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple controls makes it more difficult to attack information resources by increasing the work factor of the adversary; it also increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination of allocated controls is essential to ensure that an attack that involves one control does not create adverse, unintended consequences by interfering with other controls. Unintended consequences can include system lockout and cascading alarms. The placement of controls in systems and organizations is an important activity that requires thoughtful analysis.

Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings. For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at different times, often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms based on their priorities and development schedules. By deploying different products at different locations, there is an increased likelihood that at least one of the products will detect the malicious code. With respect to privacy, vendors may offer products that track personally identifiable information in systems. Products may use different tracking methods. Using multiple products may result in more assurance that personally identifiable information is inventoried.\n**Related Controls:** SC-29, SR-3.\n**References:** [OMB A-130], [SP 800-160-1], [SP 800-160-2].",
  "## PL-9 Central Management\n**Control:** Centrally manage [Assignment: organization-defined controls and related processes].\n**Discussion:** Central management refers to organization-wide management and implementation of selected controls and processes. This includes planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed controls and processes. As the central management of controls is generally associated with the concept of common (inherited) controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of control implementations and management and the judicious use of organizational resources. Centrally managed controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate and as part of organizational continuous monitoring. Automated tools (e.g., security information and event management tools or enterprise security monitoring and management tools) can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of information associated with centrally managed controls and processes. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities; alerting mechanisms; and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization.\nAs part of the control selection processes, organizations determine the controls that may be suitable for central management based on resources and capabilities.

  "## PL-10 BASELINE SELECTION\n\n### Control\nSelect a control baseline for the system.\n\n### Discussion\nControl baselines are predefined sets of controls specifically assembled to address the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of interest. Controls are chosen for baselines to either satisfy mandates imposed by laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines or address threats common to all users of the baseline under the assumptions specific to the baseline. Baselines represent a starting point for the protection of individuals' privacy, information, and information systems with subsequent tailoring actions to manage risk in accordance with mission, business, or other constraints (see PL-11). Federal control baselines are provided in [SP 800-53B]. The selection of a control baseline is determined by the needs of stakeholders. Stakeholder needs consider mission and business requirements as well as mandates imposed by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the control baselines in [SP 800-53B] are based on the requirements from [FISMA] and [PRIVACT]. The requirements, along with the NIST standards and guidelines implementing the legislation, direct organizations to select one of the control baselines after reviewing the information types and the information that is processed, stored, and transmitted on the system; analyzing the potential adverse impact of the loss or compromise of the information or system on the organization's operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation; and considering the results from system and organizational risk assessments.

Tailoring actions facilitate such specialization and customization by allowing organizations to develop security and privacy plans that reflect their specific mission and business functions, the environments where their systems operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and any other conditions or situations that can impact their mission or business success. Tailoring guidance is provided in [SP 800-53B]. Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common controls, applying scoping considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning values to control parameters, supplementing the control baseline with additional controls as needed, and providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in [SP 800-53B] can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring actions can be applied to the baselines in [SP 800-53B] in accordance with the security and privacy requirements from [FISMA], [PRIVACT], and [OMB A-130]. Alternatively, other communities of interest adopting different control baselines can apply the tailoring actions in [SP 800-53B] to specialize or customize the controls that represent the specific needs and concerns of those entities.\n\n### Related Controls:\nPL-10, RA-2, RA-3, RA-9, SA-8.\n\n### Control Enhancements:\nNone.",

Inherent to defining protection and personally identifiable information processing needs is an understanding of the adverse impact that could result if a compromise or breach of information occurs. The categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations. Privacy risks to individuals can arise from the compromise of personally identifiable information, but they can also arise as unintended consequences or a byproduct of the processing of personally identifiable information at any stage of the information life cycle. Privacy risk assessments are used to prioritize the risks that are created for individuals from system processing of personally identifiable information. These risk assessments enable the selection of the required privacy controls for the organization and systems. Mission and business process definitions and the associated protection requirements are documented in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.\n\n## Related Controls\n- CP-2\n- PL-2\n- PM-7\n- PM-8\n- RA-2\n- RA-3\n- RA-9\n- SA-2\n\n## Control Enhancements\nNone.\n\n## References\n- [OMB A-130]\n- [FIPS 199]\n- [SP 800-39]\n- [SP 800-60-1]\n- [SP 800-60-2]\n- [SP 800-160-1]\n\n# PM-12 Insider Threat Program\n\n## Control\nImplement an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team.",

The same standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified and other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and nontechnical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations to prepare department or agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness training to employees, receive access to information from offices in the department or agency for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department or agency insider threat posture.\n\nInsider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams.

Update the plan [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and to address changes in federal privacy laws and policy and organizational changes and problems identified during plan implementation or privacy control assessments.\n\n## Discussion\n\nA privacy program plan is a formal document that provides an overview of an organization's privacy program, including a description of the structure of the privacy program, the resources dedicated to the privacy program, the role of the senior agency official for privacy and other privacy officials and staff, the strategic goals and objectives of the privacy program, and the program management controls and common controls in place or planned for meeting applicable privacy requirements and managing privacy risks. Privacy program plans can be represented in single documents or compilations of documents.\n\nThe senior agency official for privacy is responsible for designating which privacy controls the organization will treat as program management, common, system-specific, and hybrid controls. Privacy program plans provide sufficient information about the privacy program management and common controls (including the specification of parameters and assignment and selection operations explicitly or by reference) to enable control implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.\n\nProgram management controls are generally implemented at the organization level and are essential for managing the organization's privacy program. Program management controls are distinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid controls because program management controls are independent of any particular information system. Together, the privacy plans for individual systems and the organization-wide privacy program plan provide complete coverage for the privacy controls employed within the organization.\n\nCommon controls are documented in an appendix to the organization's privacy program plan unless the controls are included in a separate privacy plan for a system.

As a general matter, a matching program is a computerized comparison of records from two or more automated [PRIVACT] systems of records or an automated system of records and automated records maintained by a non-federal agency (or agent thereof). A matching program either pertains to Federal benefit programs or Federal personnel or payroll records. At a minimum, the Data Integrity Board includes the Inspector General of the agency, if any, and the senior agency official for privacy.\n\n## Related Controls\n- AC-4\n- PM-19\n- PM-23\n- PT-2\n- PT-8\n\n## Control Enhancements\nNone.\n\n## References\n- [PRIVACT]\n- [OMB A-130]\n- [OMB A-108]\n\n# PM-25 MINIMIZATION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION USED IN TESTING, TRAINING, AND RESEARCH\n\n## Control\na.

Reporting the security and privacy status of organizational systems to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].\n\n## Discussion\nContinuous monitoring at the organization level facilitates ongoing awareness of the security and privacy posture across the organization to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms \"continuous\" and \"ongoing\" imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring guide and inform risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security- and privacy-related information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make effective, timely, and informed risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization decisions. To further facilitate security and privacy risk management, organizations consider aligning organization-defined monitoring metrics with organizational risk tolerance as defined in the risk management strategy. Monitoring requirements, including the need for monitoring, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements such as, AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-2(7)(b), AC-2(7)(c), AC-17(1), AT-4a, AU-13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CA-7, CM-3f, CM-6d, CM-11c, IR-5, MA-2b, MA-3a, MA-4a, PE-3d, PE-6, PE-14b, PE-16, PE-20, PM-6, PM-23, PS-7e, SA-9c, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-43b, SI-4.",

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy.# Programs Collaborate\n\nOn their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents.\n\nEvents that may precipitate an update to personnel security policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

Assign a risk designation to all organizational positions;\nb. Establish screening criteria for individuals filling those positions; and\nc. Review and update position risk designations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].\n\n## Discussion:\nPosition risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management (OPM) policy and guidance. Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent suitability and personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and responsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or integrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and establishes the risk level of that position. The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of the position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse effect on national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the sensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of investigation is conducted for a position. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations that individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems.\n\nPosition screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements. Parts 1400 and 731 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, establish the requirements for organizations to evaluate relevant covered positions for a position sensitivity and position risk designation commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of those positions.# Related Controls\nAC-5, AT-3, PE-2, PE-3, PL-2, PS-3, PS-6, SA-5, SA-21, SI-12.\n\n## Control Enhancements\nNone.\n\n## References\n[5 CFR 731], [SP 800-181].\n\n# PS-3 PERSONNEL SCREENING",

Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\n\n## Related Controls:\nNone.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\nNone.\n\n## References:\n[OMB A-130].\n\n# PT-2 AUTHORITY TO PROCESS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION\n\n## Control:\na.

Processing includes but is not limited to creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal. Processing operations also include logging, generation, and transformation, as well as analysis techniques, such as data mining.\n\nOrganizations may be subject to laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that establish the organization's authority and thereby limit certain types of processing of personally identifiable information or establish other requirements related to the processing. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding such authority, particularly if the organization is subject to multiple jurisdictions or sources of authority. For organizations whose processing is not determined according to legal authorities, the organization's policies and determinations govern how they process personally identifiable information. While processing of personally identifiable information may be legally permissible, privacy risks may still arise. Privacy risk assessments can identify the privacy risks associated with the authorized processing of personally identifiable information and support solutions to manage such risks.\n\nOrganizations consider applicable requirements and organizational policies to determine how to document this authority. For federal agencies, the authority to process personally identifiable information is documented in privacy policies and notices, system of records notices, privacy impact assessments, [PRIVACT] statements, computer matching agreements and notices, contracts, information sharing agreements, memoranda of understanding, and other documentation. Organizations take steps to ensure that personally identifiable information is only processed for authorized purposes, including training organizational personnel on the authorized processing of personally identifiable information and monitoring and auditing organizational use of personally identifiable information.\n\n### Related Controls",

As a general matter, a system of records notice is required when an agency maintains a group of any records under the control of the agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier. The notice describes the existence and character of the system and identifies the system of records, the purpose(s) of the system, the authority for maintenance of the records, the categories of records maintained in the system, the categories of individuals about whom records are maintained, the routine uses to which the records are subject, and additional details about the system as described in [OMB A-108].\n\n### Related Controls:\nAC-3, PM-20, PT-2, PT-3, PT-5.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\n\n### (1) SYSTEM OF RECORDS NOTICE | ROUTINE USES\nReview all routine uses published in the system of records notice at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to ensure continued accuracy, and to ensure that routine uses continue to be compatible with the purpose for which the information was collected.",

A routine use is an exception to the [PRIVACT] prohibition on the disclosure of a record in a system of records without the prior written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. To qualify as a routine use, the disclosure must be for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which the information was originally collected.

  "## Discussion:\nRisk assessment policy and procedures address the controls in the RA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of risk assessment policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to risk assessment policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\n\n### Related Controls:\nPM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\n\n### Control Enhancements:\nNone.\n\n### References:\n[OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100].\n\n## RA-2 SECURITY CATEGORIZATION\n\n### Control:\na.

Security categorization is also a type of asset loss characterization in systems security engineering processes that is carried out throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations can use privacy risk assessments or privacy impact assessments to better understand the potential adverse effects on individuals. [CNSSI 1253] provides additional guidance on categorization for national security systems. Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an organization-wide activity with the direct involvement of chief information officers, senior agency information.```markdown\n# Security Officers\n\nSenior agency officials for privacy, system owners, mission and business owners, and information owners or stewards. Organizations consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with [USA PATRIOT] and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level adverse impacts.\n\nSecurity categorization processes facilitate the development of inventories of information assets and, along with CM-8, mappings to specific system components where information is processed, stored, or transmitted.

Organizations that desire additional granularity in the system impact designations for risk-based decision-making can further partition the systems into sub-categories of the initial system categorization. For example, an impact-level prioritization on a moderate-impact system can produce three new sub-categories: low-moderate systems, moderate-moderate systems, and high-moderate systems. Impact-level prioritization and the resulting sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to focus their investments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control baselines in responding to identified risks. Impact-level prioritization can also be used to determine those systems that may be of heightened interest or value to adversaries or represent a critical loss to the federal enterprise, sometimes described as high value assets. For such high value assets, organizations may be more focused on complexity, aggregation, and information exchanges. Systems with high value assets can be prioritized by partitioning high-impact systems into low-high systems, moderate-high systems, and high-high systems. Alternatively, organizations can apply the guidance in [CNSSI 1253] for security objective-related categorization.\n\n## Related Controls\nNone.",

Organizations determine the required vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities\u2014such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors), networked printers, scanners, and copiers\u2014are not overlooked. The capability to readily update vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced and as new scanning methods are developed helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by employed vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool# Update Process\n\nThe update process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers.\n\n## Vulnerability Monitoring\n\nVulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning.",

Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning.\n\nVulnerability monitoring tools that facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).\n\n## Vulnerability Disclosure Programs\n\nVulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including notification authorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations generally expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization for remediation.\n\n## Bug Bounty Programs",

The risk tolerance of the organization influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response addresses the need to determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of action and milestones entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action and milestones entry is not needed.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nHowever, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk, and the mitigation cannot be completed immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.\n\n## Related Controls:\nCA-5, IR-9, PM-4, PM-28, RA-2, RA-3, SR-2.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\nNone.\n\n## References:\n[FIPS 199], [FIPS 200], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-37], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-160-1].\n\n# RA-8 PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n## Control:\nConduct privacy impact assessments for systems, programs, or other activities before:",

For example, criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives, policies, standards, system functionality requirements, system and component interfaces, and system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and external to the system.\n\nThe operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality, including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of-systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities that such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported by the system that contains the components and functions.",

Criticality analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development contractors.

Cyber threat hunting involves proactively searching organizational systems, networks, and infrastructure for advanced threats. The objective is to track and disrupt cyber adversaries as early as possible in the attack sequence and to measurably improve the speed and accuracy of organizational responses. Indications of compromise include unusual network traffic, unusual file changes, and the presence of malicious code. Threat hunting teams leverage existing threat intelligence and may create new threat intelligence, which is shared with peer organizations, Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAO), Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC), and relevant government departments and agencies.\n\n### Related Controls:\nCA-2, CA-7, CA-8, RA-3, RA-5, RA-6, SI-4.\n\n### Control Enhancements:\nNone.\n\n### References:\n[SP 800-30].\n\n## 3.17 SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION\n\n### Quick link to System and Services Acquisition Summary Table\n\n### SA-1 POLICY AND PROCEDURES",

  "## [Assignment: organization-defined events].\n\n### Discussion:\nSystem and services acquisition policy and procedures address the controls in the SA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of system and services acquisition policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system and services acquisition policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\n\n### Related Controls:\nPM-9, PS-8, SA-8, SI-12.\n\n### Control Enhancements:\nNone.\n\n### References:\n[OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100], [SP 800-160-1].\n\n## SA-2 ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES\n\n### Control:\na.

Integrate the organizational information security and privacy risk management process into system development life cycle activities.\n\n## Discussion\n\nA system development life cycle process provides the foundation for the successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems. The integration of security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle is a foundational principle of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical mission and business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 help individuals properly design, code, and test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy architects, and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.\n\nThe effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout the system life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational mission and business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security and privacy architectures into the enterprise architecture, consistent with the risk management strategy of the organization. Because the system development life cycle involves multiple organizations (e.g., external suppliers, developers, integrators, service providers), acquisition and supply chain risk management functions and controls play significant roles in the effective management of the system during the life cycle.\n\n## Related Controls",

Modularity and layering derived from functional decomposition are effective in managing system complexity by making it possible to comprehend the structure of the system. Modular decomposition, or refinement in system design, is challenging and resists general statements of principle. Modularity serves to isolate functions and related data structures into well-defined logical units. Layering allows the relationships of these units to be better understood so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity can be avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity to include considerations based on trust, trustworthiness, privilege, and security policy. Security-informed modular decomposition includes the allocation of policies to systems in a network, separation of system applications into processes with distinct address spaces, allocation of system policies to layers, and separation of processes into subjects with distinct privileges based on hardware-supported privilege domains.\n\n**Related Controls:** SC-2, SC-3.\n\n## (4) Security and Privacy Engineering Principles | Partially Ordered Dependencies\n\nImplement the security design principle of partially ordered dependencies in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n### Discussion",

A fundamental concept in system design is layering, whereby the system is organized into well-defined, functionally related modules or components. The layers are linearly ordered with respect to inter-layer dependencies, such that higher layers are dependent on lower layers. While providing functionality to higher layers, some layers can be self-contained and not dependent on lower.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Layers\nWhile a partial ordering of all functions in a given system may not be possible, if circular dependencies are constrained to occur within layers, the inherent problems of circularity can be more easily managed. Partially ordered dependencies and system layering contribute significantly to the simplicity and coherency of the system design. Partially ordered dependencies also facilitate system testing and analysis.\n**Related Controls:** None.\n\n## (5) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES | EFFICIENTLY MEDIATED ACCESS\nImplement the security design principle of efficiently mediated access in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n**Discussion:** The principle of efficiently mediated access states that policy enforcement mechanisms utilize the least common mechanism available while satisfying stakeholder requirements within expressed constraints. The mediation of access to system resources (i.e., CPU, memory, devices, communication ports, services, infrastructure, data, and information) is often the predominant security function of secure systems. It also enables the realization of protections for the capability provided to stakeholders by the system. Mediation of resource access can result in performance bottlenecks if the system is not designed correctly. For example, by using hardware mechanisms, efficiently mediated access can be achieved. Once access to a low-level resource such as memory has been obtained, hardware protection mechanisms can ensure that out-of-bounds access does not occur.\n**Related Controls:** AC-25.",

Minimized sharing helps to simplify system design and implementation. In order to protect user-domain resources from arbitrary active entities, no resource is shared unless that sharing has been explicitly requested and granted. The need for resource sharing can be motivated by the design principle of least common mechanism in the case of internal entities or driven by stakeholder requirements. However, internal sharing is carefully designed to avoid performance and covert storage and timing channel problems. Sharing via common mechanism can increase the susceptibility of data and information to unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or modification and can adversely affect the inherent capability provided by the system. To minimize sharing induced by common mechanisms, such mechanisms can be designed to be reentrant or virtualized to preserve separation. Moreover, the use of global data to share information is carefully scrutinized.

  "## (7) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES | REDUCED COMPLEXITY\n\nImplement the security design principle of reduced complexity in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n### Discussion:\nThe principle of reduced complexity states that the system design is as simple and small as possible. A small and simple design is more understandable, more analyzable, and less prone to error. The reduced complexity principle applies to any aspect of a system, but it has particular importance for security due to the various analyses performed to obtain evidence about the emergent security property of the system. For such analyses to be successful, a small and simple design is essential.\n\nApplication of the principle of reduced complexity contributes to the ability of system developers to understand the correctness and completeness of system security functions. It also facilitates the identification of potential vulnerabilities. The corollary of reduced complexity states that the simplicity of the system is directly related to the number of vulnerabilities it will contain; that is, simpler systems contain fewer vulnerabilities. An benefit of reduced complexity is that it is easier to understand whether the intended security policy has been captured in the system design and that fewer vulnerabilities are likely to be introduced during engineering development.\n\nAn additional benefit is that any such conclusion about correctness, completeness, and the existence of vulnerabilities can be reached with a higher degree of assurance in contrast to conclusions reached in situations where the system design is inherently more complex. Transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6) may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period.

This principle enables the composition of components such that trustworthiness is not inadvertently diminished and the trust is not consequently misplaced. Ultimately, this principle demands some metric by which the trust in a component and the trustworthiness of a component can be measured on the same abstract scale. The principle of trusted components is particularly relevant when considering systems and components in which there are complex chains of trust dependencies. A trust dependency is also referred to as a trust relationship and there may be chains of trust relationships.\n\nThe principle of trusted components also applies to a compound component that consists of subcomponents (e.g., a subsystem), which may have varying levels of trustworthiness. The conservative assumption is that the trustworthiness of a compound component is that of its least trustworthy subcomponent. It may be possible to provide a security engineering rationale that the trustworthiness of a particular compound component is greater than the conservative assumption. However, any such rationale reflects logical reasoning based on a clear statement of the trustworthiness objectives as well as relevant and credible evidence.

The partial ordering provides the basis for trustworthiness reasoning or an assurance case (assurance argument) when composing a secure system from heterogeneously trustworthy components. To analyze a system composed of heterogeneously trustworthy components for its trustworthiness, it is essential to eliminate circular dependencies with regard to the trustworthiness. If a more trustworthy component located in a lower layer of the system were to depend on a less trustworthy component in a higher layer, this would, in effect, put the components in the same \"less trustworthy\" equivalence class per the principle of trusted components. Trust relationships, or chains of trust, can have various manifestations. For example, the root certificate of a certificate hierarchy is the most trusted node in the hierarchy, whereas the leaves in the hierarchy may be the least trustworthy nodes. Another example occurs in a layered high-assurance system where the security kernel (including the hardware base), which is located at the lowest layer of the system, is the most trustworthy component. The principle of hierarchical trust, however, does not prohibit the use of overly trustworthy components. There may be cases in a system of low trustworthiness where it is reasonable to employ a highly trustworthy component rather than one that is less trustworthy (e.g., due to availability or other cost-benefit driver). For such a case, any dependency of the highly trustworthy component upon a less trustworthy component does not degrade the trustworthiness of the resulting low-trust system.\n\n**Related Controls:** None.\n\n## (11) Security and Privacy Engineering Principles | Inverse Modification Threshold\n\nImplement the security design principle of inverse modification threshold in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].",

As the trust placed in a component increases, the protection against unauthorized modification of the component also increases to the same degree. Protection from unauthorized modification can come in the form of the component's own self-protection and innate trustworthiness, or it can come from the protections afforded to the component from other elements or attributes of the security architecture (to include protections in the environment of operation).\n\n**Related Controls:** None.\n\n## (12) Security and Privacy Engineering Principles | Hierarchical Protection\n\nImplement the security design principle of hierarchical protection in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].# Discussion: Hierarchical Protection\n\nThe principle of hierarchical protection states that a component need not be protected from more trustworthy components. In the degenerate case of the most trusted component, it protects itself from all other components. For example, if an operating system kernel is deemed the most trustworthy component in a system, then it protects itself from all untrusted applications it supports, but the applications, conversely, do not need to protect themselves from the kernel. The trustworthiness of users is a consideration for applying the principle of hierarchical protection. A trusted system need not protect itself from an equally trustworthy user, reflecting use of untrusted systems in \"system high\" environments where users are highly trustworthy and where other protections are put in place to bound and protect the \"system high\" execution environment.\n\n## Related Controls: None.\n\n----\n\n# (13) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES | MINIMIZED SECURITY ELEMENTS\n\nImplement the security design principle of minimized security elements in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n## Discussion:",

The principle of minimized security elements has two aspects: the overall cost of security analysis and the complexity of security analysis. Trusted components are generally costlier to construct and implement, owing to the increased rigor of development processes. Trusted components require greater security analysis to qualify their trustworthiness. Thus, to reduce the cost and decrease the complexity of the security analysis, a system contains as few trustworthy components as possible. The analysis of the interaction of trusted components with other components of the system is one of the most important aspects of system security verification. If the interactions between components are unnecessarily complex, the security of the system will also be more difficult to ascertain than one whose internal trust relationships are simple and elegantly constructed. In general, fewer trusted components result in fewer internal trust relationships and a simpler system.\n\n## Related Controls: None.\n\n----\n\n# (14) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES | LEAST PRIVILEGE\n\nImplement the security design principle of least privilege in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n## Discussion:\n\nThe principle of least privilege states that each system component is allocated sufficient privileges to accomplish its specified functions but no more. Applying the principle of least privilege limits the scope of the component's actions, which has two desirable effects: the security impact of a failure, corruption, or misuse of the component will have a minimized security impact, and the security analysis of the component will be simplified. Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in all aspects of the secure system.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Design\n\nInterfaces used to invoke component capability are available to only certain subsets of the user population, and component design supports a sufficiently fine granularity of privilege decomposition.

One aspect of internal least privilege is to construct modules so that only the elements encapsulated by the module are directly operated on by the functions within the module. Elements external to a module that may be affected by the module's operation are indirectly accessed through interaction (e.g., via a function call) with the module that contains those elements. Another aspect of internal least privilege is that the scope of a given module or component includes only those system elements that are necessary for its functionality and that the access modes for the elements (e.g., read, write) are minimal.\n\nRelated Controls: AC-6, CM-7.\n\n## (15) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES | PREDICATE PERMISSION\n\nImplement the security design principle of predicate permission in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n### Discussion\n\nThe principle of predicate permission states that system designers consider requiring multiple authorized entities to provide consent before a highly critical operation or access to highly sensitive data, information, or resources is allowed to proceed.

No assurances that the system can provide the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy protections for its design capability can be made if there are gaps in the protection. Any assurances about the ability to secure a delivered capability require that data and information are continuously protected. That is, there are no periods during which data and information are left unprotected while under control of the system (i.e., during the creation, storage, processing, or communication of the data and information, as well as during system initialization, execution, failure, interruption, and shutdown).\n\nContinuous protection requires adherence to the precepts of the reference monitor concept (i.e., every request is validated by the reference monitor; the reference monitor is able to protect itself from tampering; and sufficient assurance of the correctness and completeness of the mechanism can be ascertained from analysis and testing) and the principle of secure failure and recovery (i.e., preservation of a secure state during error, fault, failure, and successful attack; preservation of a secure state during recovery to normal, degraded, or alternative operational modes).",

The continuous protection principle requires that changes to the system security policies be traceable to the operational need that drives the configuration and be verifiable (i.e., it is possible to verify that the proposed changes will not put the system into an insecure state). Insufficient traceability and verification may lead to inconsistent states or protection discontinuities due to the complex or undecidable nature of the problem.\n\nThe use of pre-verified configuration definitions that reflect the new security policy enables analysis to determine that a transition from old to new policies is essentially atomic and that any residual effects from the old policy are guaranteed to not conflict with the new policy.

The principle of accountability and traceability requires a trustworthy infrastructure that can record details about actions that affect system security (e.g., an audit subsystem). To record the details about actions, the system is able to uniquely identify the entity on whose behalf the action is being carried out and also record the relevant sequence of actions that are carried out. The accountability policy also requires that the audit trail itself be protected from unauthorized access and modification. The principle of least privilege assists in tracing the actions to particular entities, as it increases the granularity of accountability. Associating specific actions with system entities, and ultimately with users, and making the audit trail secure against unauthorized access and modifications provide non-repudiation because once an action is recorded, it is not possible to change the audit trail. Another important function that accountability and traceability serves is in the routine and forensic analysis of events associated with the violation of security policy. Analysis of audit logs may provide additional information that may be helpful in determining the path or component that allowed the violation of the security policy and the actions of individuals associated with the violation of the security policy.\n\n**Related Controls:** AC-6, AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-9, AU-10, AU-12, IA-2, IR-4.",

The initial configuration aspect of this principle requires that any \"as shipped\" configuration of a system, subsystem, or system component does not aid in the violation of the security policy and can prevent the system from operating in the default configuration for those cases where the security policy itself requires configuration by the operational user.\n\nRestrictive defaults mean that the system will operate \"as-shipped\" with adequate self-protection and be able to prevent security breaches before the intended security policy and system configuration is established. In cases where the protection provided by the \"as-shipped\" product is inadequate, stakeholders assess the risk of using it prior to establishing a secure initial state. Adherence to the principle of secure defaults guarantees that a system is established in a secure state upon successfully completing initialization. In situations where the system fails to complete initialization, either it will perform a requested operation using secure defaults or it will not perform the operation. Refer to the principles of continuous protection and secure failure and recovery that parallel this principle to provide the ability to detect and recover from failure.\n\nThe security engineering approach to this principle states that security mechanisms deny requests unless the request is found to be well-formed and consistent with the security policy.

In addition, when specified, the system is capable of recovering from impending or actual failure to resume normal, degraded, or alternative secure operation.# Operations\n\nwhile ensuring that a secure state is maintained such that security policies are not violated.\n\nFailure is a condition in which the behavior of a component deviates from its specified or expected behavior for an explicitly documented input. Once a failed security function is detected, the system may reconfigure itself to circumvent the failed component while maintaining security and provide all or part of the functionality of the original system, or it may completely shut itself down to prevent any further violation of security policies. For this to occur, the reconfiguration functions of the system are designed to ensure continuous enforcement of security policy during the various phases of reconfiguration.",

For this to occur, the reconfiguration functions of the system are designed to ensure continuous enforcement of security policy during the various phases of reconfiguration.\n\nAnother technique that can be used to recover from failures is to perform a rollback to a secure state (which may be the initial state) and then either shutdown or replace the service or component that failed such that secure operations may resume. Failure of a component may or may not be detectable to the components using it. The principle of secure failure indicates that components fail in a state that denies rather than grants access. For example, a nominally \"atomic\" operation interrupted before completion does not violate security policy and is designed to handle interruption events by employing higher-level atomicity and rollback mechanisms (e.g., transactions). If a service is being used, its atomicity properties are well-documented and characterized so that the component availing itself of that service can detect and handle interruption events appropriately. For example, a system is designed to gracefully respond to disconnection and support resynchronization and data consistency after disconnection.",

For example, a system is designed to gracefully respond to disconnection and support resynchronization and data consistency after disconnection.\n\nFailure protection strategies that employ replication of policy enforcement mechanisms, sometimes called defense in depth, can allow the system to continue in a secure state even when one mechanism has failed to protect the system. If the mechanisms are similar, however, the additional protection may be illusory, as the adversary can simply attack in series. Similarly, in a networked system, breaking the security on one system or service may enable an attacker to do the same on other similar replicated systems and services. By employing multiple protection mechanisms whose features are significantly different, the possibility of attack replication or repetition can be reduced. Analyses are conducted to weigh the costs and benefits of such redundancy techniques against increased resource usage and adverse effects on the overall system performance. Additional analyses are conducted as the complexity of these mechanisms increases, as could be the case for dynamic behaviors. Increased complexity generally reduces trustworthiness. When a resource cannot be continuously protected, it is critical to detect and repair.# SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES\n\n## ECONOMIC SECURITY\n\nImplement the security design principle of economic security in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].",
  "## ECONOMIC SECURITY\n\nImplement the security design principle of economic security in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n**Discussion:** The principle of economic security states that security mechanisms are not costlier than the potential damage that could occur from a security breach. This is the security-relevant form of the cost-benefit analyses used in risk management. The cost assumptions of cost-benefit analysis prevent the system designer from incorporating security mechanisms of greater strength than necessary, where strength of mechanism is proportional to cost. The principle of economic security also requires analysis of the benefits of assurance relative to the cost of that assurance in terms of the effort expended to obtain relevant and credible evidence as well as the necessary analyses to assess and draw trustworthiness and risk conclusions from the evidence.\n\n**Related Controls:** CP-10, CP-12, SC-7, SC-8, SC-24, SI-13, RA-3.\n\n## PERFORMANCE SECURITY\n\nImplement the security design principle of performance security in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n**Discussion:** The principle of performance security states that security mechanisms are constructed so that they do not degrade system performance unnecessarily. Stakeholder and system design requirements for performance and security are precisely articulated and prioritized. For the system implementation to meet its design requirements and be found acceptable to stakeholders (i.e., validation against stakeholder requirements), the designers adhere to the specified constraints that capability performance needs place on protection needs. The overall impact of computationally intensive security services (e.g., cryptography) are assessed and demonstrated to pose no significant impact to higher-priority performance considerations or are deemed to provide an acceptable trade-off of performance for trustworthy protection. The trade-off considerations include less computationally intensive security services unless they are unavailable or insufficient. The insufficiency of a security service is determined by functional capability and strength of mechanism. The strength of mechanism is selected with respect to security requirements, performance-critical overhead issues (e.g., cryptographic key management), and an assessment of the capability of the threat.\n\nThe principle of performance security leads to the incorporation of features that help in the enforcement of security policy but incur minimum overhead, such as low-level hardware mechanisms upon which higher-level services can be built. Such low-level mechanisms are usually very specific, have very limited functionality, and are optimized for performance.# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n## Example",

Application of this principle reinforces the need to design security into the system from the ground up and to incorporate simple mechanisms at the lower layers that can be used as building blocks for higher-level mechanisms.\n\n**Related Controls:** SC-12, SC-13, SI-2, SI-7.\n\n----\n\n## (27) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES | HUMAN FACTORED SECURITY\n\nImplement the security design principle of human factored security in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n### Discussion\n\nThe principle of human factored security states that the user interface for security functions and supporting services is intuitive, user-friendly, and provides feedback for user actions that affect such policy and its enforcement. The mechanisms that enforce security policy are not intrusive to the user and are designed not to degrade user efficiency. Security policy enforcement mechanisms also provide the user with meaningful, clear, and relevant feedback and warnings when insecure choices are being made. Particular attention is given to interfaces through which personnel responsible for system administration and operation configure and set up the security policies. Ideally, these personnel are able to understand the impact of their choices. Personnel with system administrative and operational responsibilities are able to configure systems before start-up and administer them during runtime with confidence that their intent is correctly mapped to the system's mechanisms. Security services, functions, and mechanisms do not impede or unnecessarily complicate the intended use of the system. There is a trade-off between system usability and the strictness necessary for security policy enforcement. If security mechanisms are frustrating or difficult to use, then users may disable them, avoid them, or use them in ways inconsistent with the security requirements and protection needs that the mechanisms were designed to satisfy.\n\n**Related Controls:** None.\n\n----\n\n## (28) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES | ACCEPTABLE SECURITY\n\nImplement the security design principle of acceptable security in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n### Discussion",

The perception of personal privacy may affect user behavior, morale, and effectiveness. Based on the organizational privacy policy and the system design, users should be able to restrict their actions to protect their privacy. When systems fail to provide intuitive interfaces or meet privacy and performance expectations, users may either choose to completely avoid the system or use it in ways that may be inefficient or even insecure.\n\n**Related Controls:** None.# SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES\n\n## REPEATABLE AND DOCUMENTED PROCEDURES\n\nImplement the security design principle of repeatable and documented procedures in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n**Discussion:** The principle of repeatable and documented procedures states that the techniques and methods employed to construct a system component permit the same component to be completely and correctly reconstructed at a later time. Repeatable and documented procedures support the development of a component that is identical to the component created earlier, which may be in widespread use. In the case of other system artifacts (e.g., documentation and testing results), repeatability supports consistency and the ability to inspect the artifacts. Repeatable and documented procedures can be introduced at various stages within the system development life cycle and contribute to the ability to evaluate assurance claims for the system. Examples include systematic procedures for code development and review, procedures for the configuration management of development tools and system artifacts, and procedures for system delivery.\n\n**Related Controls:** CM-1, SA-1, SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-17, SC-1, SI-1.\n\n## PROCEDURAL RIGOR\n\nImplement the security design principle of procedural rigor in [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].",

Procedural rigor defines the scope, depth, and detail of the system life cycle procedures. Rigorous system life cycle procedures contribute to the assurance that the system is correct and free of unintended functionality in several ways. First, the procedures impose checks and balances on the life cycle process such that the introduction of unspecified functionality is prevented. Second, rigorous procedures applied to systems security engineering activities that produce specifications and other system design documents contribute to the ability to understand the system as it has been built rather than trusting that the component, as implemented, is the authoritative (and potentially misleading) specification. Finally, modifications to an existing system component are easier when there are detailed specifications that describe its current design instead of studying source code or schematics to try to understand how it works. Procedural rigor helps ensure that security functional and assurance requirements have been satisfied, and it contributes to a better-informed basis for the determination of trustworthiness and risk posture. Procedural rigor is commensurate with the degree of assurance desired for the system. If the required trustworthiness of the system is low, a high level of procedural rigor may add unnecessary cost, whereas when high trustworthiness is critical, the cost of high procedural rigor is merited.\n\n**Related Controls:** None.# SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES\n\n## SECURE SYSTEM MODIFICATION\nImplement the security design principle of secure system modification in\n[Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].",
  "**Related Controls:** None.# SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES\n\n## SECURE SYSTEM MODIFICATION\nImplement the security design principle of secure system modification in\n[Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n**Discussion:** The principle of secure system modification states that system modification maintains system security with respect to the security requirements and risk tolerance of stakeholders. Upgrades or modifications to systems can transform secure systems into systems that are not secure. The procedures for system modification ensure that if the system is to maintain its trustworthiness, the same rigor that was applied to its initial development is applied to any system changes. Because modifications can affect the ability of the system to maintain its secure state, a careful security analysis of the modification is needed prior to its implementation and deployment. This principle parallels the principle of secure evolvability.\n\n**Related Controls:** CM-3, CM-4.\n\n## SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION\nImplement the security design principle of sufficient documentation in\n[Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].\n\n**Discussion:** The principle of sufficient documentation states that organizational personnel with responsibilities to interact with the system are provided with adequate documentation and other information such that the personnel contribute to rather than detract from system security. Despite attempts to comply with principles such as human factored security and acceptable security, systems are inherently complex, and the design intent for the use of security mechanisms and the ramifications of the misuse or misconfiguration of security mechanisms are not always intuitively obvious. Uninformed and insufficiently trained users can introduce vulnerabilities due to errors of omission and commission. The availability of documentation and training can help to ensure a knowledgeable cadre of personnel, all of whom have a critical role in the achievement of principles such as continuous protection. Documentation is written clearly and supported by training that provides security awareness and understanding of security-relevant responsibilities.\n\n**Related Controls:** AT-2, AT-3, SA-5.\n\n## MINIMIZATION\nImplement the privacy principle of minimization using\n[Assignment: organization-defined processes].\n\n**Discussion:** The principle of minimization states that organizations should only process personally identifiable information that is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish an authorized purpose and should only maintain personally identifiable information for as long as is necessary to accomplish the purpose.

Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the relationships can be monitored. External system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for implemented controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance.\n\n### Related Controls:\n- AC-20\n- CA-3\n- CP-2\n- IR-4\n- IR-7\n- PL-10\n- PL-11\n- PS-7\n- SA-2\n- SA-4\n- SR-3\n- SR-5\n\n### Control Enhancements:\n(1) EXTERNAL SYSTEM SERVICES | RISK ASSESSMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVALS\n(a) Conduct an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of information security services; and\n(b) Verify that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].",

Trust relationships can be complicated due to the potentially large number of entities participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and levels of trust, and types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the level of control that organizations can exert on external service providers regarding the controls necessary for the protection of the service, information, or individual privacy and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of the implemented controls.

Security properties of systems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. The interconnections or changes\u2014including upgrading or replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware\u2014may adversely affect previously implemented controls. Ongoing assessment during development allows for additional types of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as manual code review, security architecture review, and penetration testing, as well as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three analysis approaches. Developers can use the analysis approaches, along with security instrumentation and fuzzing, in a variety of tools and in source code reviews. The security and privacy assessment plans include the specific activities that developers plan to carry out, including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components; the degree of rigor to be applied; the frequency of the ongoing testing and evaluation; and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of testing and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process.

Useful information for assessors who conduct penetration testing includes product and system design specifications, source code, and administrator and operator manuals.

Dynamic code analysis employs runtime tools to ensure that security functionality performs in the way it was designed. A type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by deliberately introducing malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies are derived from the intended use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (i.e., checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (i.e., checking for words that are out of place in software code, such as non-English language words or derogatory terms).\n\n**Related Controls:** None.\n\n# (9) DEVELOPER TESTING AND EVALUATION | INTERACTIVE APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING\n\nRequire the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ interactive application security testing tools to identify flaws and document the results.\n\n## Discussion",

The use of instrumentation relies on direct measurements of the actual running applications and uses access to the code, user interaction, libraries, frameworks, backend connections, and configurations to directly measure control effectiveness. When combined with analysis techniques, interactive application security testing can identify a broad range of potential vulnerabilities and confirm control effectiveness.

Attack surface reduction includes implementing the concept of layered defenses, applying the principles of least privilege and least functionality, applying secure software development practices, deprecating unsafe functions, reducing entry points available to unauthorized users, reducing the amount of code that executes, and eliminating application programming interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable to attacks.\n\n**Related Controls:** AC-6, CM-7, RA-3, SA-11.\n\n## (6) Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Continuous Improvement\n\nRequire the developer of the system, system component, or system service to implement an explicit process to continuously improve the development process.\n\n**Discussion:** Developers of systems, system components, and system services consider the effectiveness and efficiency of their development processes for meeting quality objectives and addressing the security and privacy capabilities in current threat environments.\n\n**Related Controls:** None.\n\n## (7) Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Automated Vulnerability Analysis\n\nRequire the developer of the system, system component, or system service [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to:\n\n(a) Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using [Assignment: organization-defined tools];\n(b) Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;\n(c) Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and\n(d) Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].\n\n**Discussion:** Automated tools can be more effective at analyzing exploitable weaknesses or# Deficiencies in Large and Complex Systems\n\nPrioritizing vulnerabilities by severity, and providing recommendations for risk mitigations.\n**Related Controls:** RA-5, SA-11.\n\n## (8) Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Reuse of Threat and Vulnerability Information\n\nRequire the developer of the system, system component, or system service to use threat modeling and vulnerability analyses from similar systems, components, or services to inform the current development process.",

A small and simple design is easier to understand and analyze and is also less prone to error (see AC-25, SA-8(13)). The principle of reduced complexity applies to any aspect of a system, but it has particular importance for security due to the various analyses performed to obtain evidence about the emergent security property of the system. For such analyses to be successful, a small and simple design is essential. Application of the principle of reduced complexity contributes to the ability of system developers to understand the correctness and completeness of system security functions and facilitates the identification of potential vulnerabilities. The corollary of reduced complexity states that the simplicity of the system is directly related to the number of vulnerabilities it will contain. That is, simpler systems contain fewer vulnerabilities. An important benefit of reduced complexity is that it is easier to understand whether the security policy has been captured in the system design and that fewer vulnerabilities are likely to be introduced during engineering development. An additional benefit is that any such conclusion about correctness, completeness, and existence of vulnerabilities can be reached with a higher degree of assurance in contrast to conclusions reached in situations where the system design is inherently more complex.\n\n### Related Controls:\nAC-25, SA-8, SC-3.\n\n## (6) DEVELOPER SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | STRUCTURE FOR TESTING\n\nRequire the developer of the system, system component, or system service to structure security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to facilitate testing.",

Second, the security analysis of the component is simplified. Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in all aspects of the secure system design. Interfaces used to invoke component capability are available to only certain subsets of the user population, and component design supports a sufficiently fine granularity of privilege decomposition. For example, in the case of an audit mechanism, there may be an interface for the audit manager, who configures the audit settings; an interface for the audit operator, who ensures that audit data is safely collected and stored; and, finally, yet another interface for the audit reviewer, who only has a need to view the audit data that has been collected but no need to perform operations on that data.",

One aspect of internal least privilege is to construct modules so that only the elements encapsulated by the module are directly operated upon by the functions within the module. Elements external to a module that may be affected by the module's operation are indirectly accessed through interaction (e.g., via a function call) with the module that contains those elements. Another aspect of internal least privilege is that the scope of a given module or component includes only those system elements that are necessary for its functionality, and the access modes to the elements (e.g., read, write) are minimal.\n\n### Related Controls: AC-5, AC-6, SA-8.\n\n## (8) Developer Security and Privacy Architecture and Design | Orchestration\n\nDesign [Assignment: organization-defined critical systems or system components] with coordinated behavior to implement the following capabilities: [Assignment: organization-defined capabilities, by system or component].\n\n### Discussion\n\nSecurity resources that are distributed, located at different layers or in different system elements, or are implemented to support different aspects of trustworthiness can interact in unforeseen or incorrect ways.

Developer trustworthiness may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and relationships that the company has with entities that may potentially affect the quality and reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.

An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in an opportunity for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components.# Exceptions to Replacing Unsupported System Components\n\nExceptions to replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option. Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors when such components remain essential to organizational mission and business functions. If necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for critical software components or, alternatively, obtain the services of external providers who provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components through contractual relationships. Such contractual relationships can include open-source software value-added vendors. The increased risk of using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for example, by prohibiting the connection of such components to public or uncontrolled networks, or implementing other forms of isolation.\n\n## Related Controls:\nPL-2, SA-3.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\n(1) UNSUPPORTED SYSTEM COMPONENTS | ALTERNATIVE SOURCES FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SA-22.]\n\n## References:\nNone.\n\n# SA-23 SPECIALIZATION\n\n## Control:\nEmploy [Selection (one or more): design; modification; augmentation; reconfiguration] on [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components] supporting mission essential services or functions to increase the trustworthiness in those systems or components.",

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of system and communications protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system and communications protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\n\n### Related Controls:\nPM-9, PS-8, SA-8, SI-12.\n\n### Control Enhancements:\nNone.\n\n### References:\n[OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-100].\n\n## SC-2 SEPARATION OF SYSTEM AND USER FUNCTIONALITY\n\n### Control:\nSeparate user functionality, including user interface services, from system management functionality.",

These functions typically require privileged user access. The separation of user functions from system management functions is physical or logical. Organizations may separate system management functions from user functions by using different computers, instances of operating systems,\n```# Central Processing\n\nUnits, or network addresses; by employing virtualization techniques; or some combination of these or other methods. Separation of system management functions from user functions includes web administrative interfaces that employ separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources. Separation of system and user functions may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls. The separation of system and user functionality can be achieved by applying the systems security engineering design principles in SA-8, including SA-8(1), SA-8(3), SA-8(4), SA-8(10), SA-8(12), SA-8(13), SA-8(14), and SA-8(18).\n\n## Related Controls:\nAC-6, SA-4, SA-8, SC-3, SC-7, SC-22, SC-32, SC-39.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\n\n### (1) Separation of System and User Functionality | Interfaces for Non-Privileged Users\nPrevent the presentation of system management functionality at interfaces to non-privileged users.\n\n**Discussion:** Preventing the presentation of system management functionality at interfaces to non-privileged users ensures that system administration options, including administrator privileges, are not available to the general user population.

The isolation boundary controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform system security functions. Systems implement code separation in many ways, such as through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Systems can restrict access to security functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all code within the defined security function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include nonsecurity functions.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",

Nonsecurity functions contained within the isolation boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or malicious code in the software can directly impact the security functions of systems. The fundamental design objective is that the specific portions of systems that provide information security are of minimal size and complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity functions in the security-relevant system components allows designers and implementers to focus only on those functions which are necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically access enforcement). By minimizing the nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundaries, the amount of code that is trusted to enforce security policies is significantly reduced, thus contributing to understandability.\n\n**Related Controls:** None.\n\n### (4) SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MODULE COUPLING AND COHESIVENESS\nImplement security functions as largely independent modules that maximize internal cohesiveness within modules and minimize coupling between modules.",

This method of network access enables a user to access remote devices and simultaneously, access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources, such as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external connections, making the system vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling configuration settings that allow such capability in remote devices and by preventing those configuration settings from being configurable by users. Prevention can also be achieved by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. A virtual private network (VPN)\n```# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## can be used to securely provision a split tunnel.\nA securely provisioned VPN includes locking connectivity to exclusive, managed, and named environments, or to a specific set of pre-approved addresses, without user control.\n**Related Controls:** None.",

A proxy server is a server (i.e., system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients requesting system resources from non-organizational or other organizational servers. System resources that may be requested include files, connections, web pages, or services. Client requests established through a connection to a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and provide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy servers that provide access to the Internet. Proxy servers can support the logging of Transmission Control Protocol sessions and the blocking of specific Uniform Resource Locators, Internet Protocol addresses, and domain names. Web proxies can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites. Note that proxy servers may inhibit the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and create the potential for \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks (depending on the implementation).\n**Related Controls:** AC-3.\n\n## (9) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT THREATENING OUTGOING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC\n(a) Detect and deny outgoing communications traffic posing a threat to external systems; and\n(b) Audit the identity of internal users associated with denied communications.\n**Discussion:** Detecting outgoing communications traffic from internal actions that may pose threats to external systems is known as extrusion detection.

The restriction of incoming communications traffic provides determinations that source and destination address pairs represent authorized or allowed communications. Determinations can be based on several factors, including the presence of such address pairs in the lists of authorized or allowed communications, the absence of such address pairs in lists of unauthorized or disallowed pairs, or meeting more general rules for authorized or allowed source and destination pairs. Strong authentication of network addresses is not possible without the use of explicit security protocols, and thus, addresses can often be spoofed.

Permit users to invoke the trusted communications path for communications between the user and the following security functions of the system, including at a minimum, authentication and re-authentication: [Assignment: organization-defined security functions].\n\n### Discussion\nTrusted paths are mechanisms by which users can communicate (using input devices such as keyboards) directly with the security functions of systems with the requisite assurance to support security policies. Trusted path mechanisms can only be activated by users or the security functions of organizational systems. User responses that occur via trusted paths are protected from modification by and disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ trusted paths for trustworthy, high-assurance connections between security functions of systems and users, including during system logons. The original implementations of trusted paths employed an out-of-band signal to initiate the path, such as using the `<BREAK>` key, which does not transmit characters that can be spoofed. In later implementations, a key combination that could not be hijacked was used (e.g., the `<CTRL>` + `<ALT>` + `` keys). Such key combinations, however, are platform-specific and may not provide a trusted path implementation in every case. The enforcement of trusted communications paths is provided by a specific.# Implementation that Meets the Reference Monitor Concept\n\n## Related Controls:\n- AC-16\n- AC-25\n- SC-12\n- SC-23\n\n## Control Enhancements:\n\n### (1) Trusted Path | Irrefutable Communications Path\n(a) Provide a trusted communications path that is irrefutably distinguishable from other communications paths; and\n(b) Initiate the trusted communications path for communications between the [Assignment: organization-defined security functions] of the system and the user.\n\n#### Discussion:\nAn irrefutable communications path permits the system to initiate a trusted path, which necessitates that the user can unmistakably recognize the source of the communication as a trusted system component.

System-related information that requires protection includes configurations or rule sets for firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, filtering routers, and authentication information. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing write-once-read-many (WORM) technologies.

Such actions may impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations that support critical missions or business functions.

Changing processing and storage locations (also referred to as moving target defense) addresses the advanced persistent threat using techniques such as virtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This enables organizations to relocate the system components (i.e., processing, storage) that support critical mission and business functions. Changing the locations of processing activities and/or storage sites introduces a degree of uncertainty into the targeting activities of adversaries. The targeting uncertainty increases the work factor of adversaries and makes compromises or breaches of the organizational systems more difficult and time-consuming. It also increases the chances that adversaries may inadvertently disclose certain aspects of their tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational resources.\n\n**Related Controls:** None.\n\n## (4) Concealment and Misdirection | Misleading Information\n\nEmploy realistic, but misleading information in [Assignment: organization-defined system components] about its security state or posture.\n\n### Discussion",

Mobile devices often include sensors that can collect and record data regarding the environment where the system is in use. Sensors that are embedded within mobile devices include microphones, cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While the sensors on mobile devices provide an important function, if activated covertly, such devices can potentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable information about individuals and organizations. For example, remotely activating the GPS function on a mobile device could provide an adversary with the ability to track the movements of an individual. Organizations may prohibit individuals from bringing cellular telephones or digital cameras into certain designated facilities or controlled areas within facilities where classified information is stored or sensitive conversations are taking place.\n\n### Related Controls: SC-15.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\n\n### (1) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | REPORTING TO AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS OR ROLES\n\nVerify that the system is configured so that data or information collected by the [Assignment: organization-defined sensors] is only reported to authorized individuals or roles.\n\nDiscussion: In situations where sensors are activated by authorized individuals, it is still possible that the data or information collected by the sensors will be sent to unauthorized entities.\n\n### Related Controls: None.\n\n### (2) SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | AUTHORIZED USE\n\nEmploy the following measures so that data or information collected by [Assignment: organization-defined sensors] is only used for authorized purposes: [Assignment: organization-defined measures].",

The organization often only has a limited set of monitoring and detection capabilities, and they may be focused on the critical or likely infiltration or exfiltration paths. By using communications paths that the organization typically does not monitor, the adversary can increase its chances of achieving its desired goals. By relocating its sensors or monitoring capabilities to new locations, the organization can impede the adversary's ability to achieve its goals. The relocation of the sensors or monitoring capabilities might be done based on threat information that the organization has acquired or randomly to confuse the adversary and make its lateral transition through the system or organization more difficult.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## More challenging.\n\n### Related Controls:\nAU-2, SC-7, SI-4.\n\n### Control Enhancements:\n#### (1) SENSOR RELOCATION | DYNAMIC RELOCATION OF SENSORS OR MONITORING CAPABILITIES\nDynamically relocate [Assignment: organization-defined sensors and monitoring capabilities] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations] under the following conditions or circumstances: [Assignment: organization-defined conditions or circumstances].\n\n**Discussion:** None.\n\n**Related Controls:** None.\n\n**References:** [SP 800-160-2].\n\n### SC-49 HARDWARE-ENFORCED SEPARATION AND POLICY ENFORCEMENT\n**Control:** Implement hardware-enforced separation and policy enforcement mechanisms between [Assignment: organization-defined security domains].\n\n**Discussion:** System owners may require additional strength of mechanism and robustness to ensure domain separation and policy enforcement for specific types of threats and environments of operation.

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of system and information integrity policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system and information integrity policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\n\n### Related Controls\n\nPM-9, PS-8, SA-8, SI-12.\n\n### Control Enhancements\n\nNone.\n\n### References\n\n[OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-100].\n\n# SI-2 FLAW REMEDIATION\n\n## Control\n\na.

Incorporate flaw remediation into the organizational configuration management process.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe need to remediate system flaws applies to all types of software and firmware.# FLAW REMEDIATION\n\nOrganizations identify systems affected by software flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this information to designated organizational personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches, service packs, and malicious code signatures. Organizations also address flaws discovered during assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. By incorporating flaw remediation into configuration management processes, required remediation actions can be tracked and verified.\n\nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of risk factors, including the security category of the system, the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw), the organizational risk tolerance, the mission supported by the system, or the threat environment. Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine that the testing of software or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, such as when implementing simple malicious code signature updates. In testing decisions, organizations consider whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures.\n\n## Related Controls\nCA-5, CM-3, CM-4, CM-5, CM-6, CM-8, MA-2, RA-5, SA-8, SA-10, SA-11, SI-3, SI-5, SI-7, SI-11.\n\n## Control Enhancements",

Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code.\n\n## Malicious Code Protection Mechanisms\n\nMalicious code protection mechanisms include both signature- and nonsignature-based technologies. Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies.\n\nIn addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software as well as custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.\n\n## Controls in Response to Malicious Code\n\nIn situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations rely on other types of controls, including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that, in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, the detection of malicious downloads, or the detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.\n\n### Related Controls",

External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations monitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives guide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved through a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and network monitoring software.\n\nDepending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices may impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations across a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency.

For example, wireless networks are more susceptible to eavesdroppers or traffic analysis than wireline networks. When wireless to wireline communications exist, the wireless network could become a port of entry into the wired network. Given the greater facility of unauthorized network access via wireless access points compared to unauthorized wired network access from within the physical boundaries of the system, additional monitoring of transitioning traffic between wireless and wired networks may be necessary to detect malicious activities.

For example, if the organization specifies that numerical values between...# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of \"387,\" \"abc,\" or \"%K%\" are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.\n\n## Related Controls: None.\n\n## Control Enhancements:",

For example, 802.11 standard wireless network protocols do not interact well with Transmission Control Protocols (TCP) when packets are dropped (which could be due to invalid packet input). TCP assumes packet losses are due to congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically dropped due to noise or collisions on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes the wrong action in response to a collision event. Adversaries may be able to use what appear to be acceptable individual behaviors of the protocols in concert to achieve adverse effects through suitable construction of invalid input.

Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required using protected information and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries attempting to compromise or breach organizational systems.\n\nNon-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components, periodically reimaging components, or using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can be implemented by using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent). The benefit of periodic refreshes of system components and services is that it does not require organizations to first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but not with such frequency that it makes the system unstable. Refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities.\n\n## Related Controls: SC-30, SC-34, SI-21.\n\n## Control Enhancements:\n\n### (1) NON-PERSISTENCE | REFRESH FROM TRUSTED SOURCES\nObtain software and data employed during system component and service refreshes from the following trusted sources: [Assignment: organization-defined trusted sources].\n\n#### Discussion:\nTrusted sources include software and data from write-once, read-only media or from selected offline secure storage facilities.\n\n## Related Controls: None.\n\n### (2) NON-PERSISTENCE | NON-PERSISTENT INFORMATION# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## (a)\n[Selection: Refresh [Assignment: organization-defined information]\n[Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; Generate [Assignment: organization-defined information] on demand]; and\n(b) Delete information when no longer needed.",

Differential privacy comes at the cost of decreased accuracy of results, forcing organizations to quantify the trade-off between privacy protection and the overall accuracy, usefulness, and utility of the de-identified dataset.

In addition, insider attacks and erroneous user procedures can remove information from the system that is in violation of the organizational policies. Tainting approaches can range from passive to active. A passive tainting approach can be as simple as adding false email names and addresses to an internal database. If the organization receives email at one of the false email addresses, it knows that the database has been compromised. Moreover, the organization knows that the email was sent by an unauthorized entity, so any packets it includes potentially contain malicious code, and that the unauthorized entity may have potentially obtained a copy of the database. Another tainting approach can include embedding false data or steganographic data in files to enable the data to be found via open-source analysis.

Once exfiltrated, there is generally no way for the organization to recover the lost information. Therefore, organizations may consider dividing the information into disparate elements and distributing those elements across multiple systems or system components and locations. Such actions will increase the adversary's work factor to capture and exfiltrate the desired information and, in so doing, increase the probability of detection.

  "### Discussion:\nSupply chain risk management policy and procedures address the controls in the SR family as well as supply chain-related controls in other families that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of supply chain risk management policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents.

Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.\n\n## Discussion:\nThe dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well as the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders.\n\nSupply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance against plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy implementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or incorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\n\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts.

Tailored SCRM plans help organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment.\n\nSupply chain risk management plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating the plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and associated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address requirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system components and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented as part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).\n\n## Related Controls\nCA-2, CP-4, IR-4, MA-2, MA-6, PE-16, PL-2, PM-9, PM-30, RA-3, RA-7, SA-8, SI-4.\n\n## Control Enhancements\n\n### (1) Supply Chain Risk Management Plan | Establish SCRM Team\nEstablish a supply chain risk management team consisting of [Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles, and responsibilities] to lead and support the following SCRM activities: [Assignment: organization-defined supply chain risk management activities].",

The team approach enables organizations to conduct an analysis of their supply chain, communicate with internal and external partners or stakeholders, and gain broad consensus regarding the appropriate resources for SCRM.\n\nThe SCRM team consists of organizational personnel with diverse roles and responsibilities for leading and supporting SCRM activities, including risk executive, information technology, contracting, information security, privacy, mission or business, legal, supply chain and logistics, acquisition, business continuity, and other relevant functions. Members of the SCRM team are involved in various aspects of the SDLC and, collectively, have an awareness of and provide expertise in acquisition processes, legal practices, vulnerabilities, threats, and attack vectors, as well as an understanding of the technical aspects and dependencies of systems. The SCRM team can be an extension of the security and privacy risk management processes or be included as part of an organizational risk management team.\n\n## Related Controls\nNone.\n\n## References\n[FASC18], [41 CFR 201], [EO 13873], [CNSSD 505], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP-800-# SR-3 SUPPLY CHAIN CONTROLS AND PROCESSES\n\n## Control:\na.

It may also include personnel and processes used to interact with or make modifications to the system, component, or associated data. Organizations consider developing procedures (see SR-1) for allocating responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance for systems and system components; transferring provenance documentation and responsibility between organizations; and preventing and monitoring for unauthorized changes to the provenance records.

Visibility into supply chain activities is also important for monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable visibility into supply chains elements, processes, and personnel, it is very difficult for organizations to understand and manage risk and reduce their susceptibility to adverse events. Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools used for the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes include development processes for hardware, software, and firmware; shipping and handling procedures; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; personnel and physical security programs; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the production and distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain personnel are individuals with specific roles and responsibilities related to the secure research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of a system or system component.

Controls can also include monitoring for out of specification performance, which can be an indicator of tampering or counterfeits. Organizations may leverage supplier and contractor processes for validating that a system or component is genuine and has not been altered and for replacing a suspect system or component. Some indications of tampering may be visible and addressable before accepting delivery, such as inconsistent packaging, broken seals, and incorrect labels. When a system or system component is suspected of being altered or counterfeit, the supplier, contractor, or original equipment manufacturer may be able to replace the item or provide a forensic capability to determine the origin of the counterfeit or altered item. Organizations can provide training to personnel on how to identify suspicious system or component deliveries.\n\n**Related Controls:** AT-3, SR-9, SR-10, SR-11.",

The validation of the internal composition and provenance of technologies, products, and services is referred to as the pedigree. For microelectronics, this includes material composition of components. For software this includes the composition of open-source and proprietary code, including the version of the component at a given point in time.
