  "# 1. Introduction\n\n## 1.1 Authority\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347. NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided A-130, Appendix III.\n\nThis guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright though attribution is desired. Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.\n\n## 1.2 Purpose\n\nOrganizations frequently must evaluate, select, and employ a variety of IT security services in order to maintain and improve their overall IT security programs. IT security services (e.g., security policy development, intrusion detection support, etc.) may be offered by an IT group internal to an organization, or by a growing group of vendors. Individuals who are responsible for selecting, implementing, and managing IT security services for an organization must carefully review the necessary processes and procedures, weigh a host of available options, and select resources that can be entrusted to optimally meet IT security program requirements.\n\nFactors to be considered when selecting, implementing, and managing IT security services include: the type of service arrangement; service provider qualifications, requirements, experience, and viability; trustworthiness of service provider employees; and protection for organization systems, applications, and data. These considerations may apply (in varying degrees) depending on the size, type, complexity, cost, and criticality of the services being considered.",

The IT security services life cycle provides a framework that enables the IT security decision makers to organize their IT security efforts\u2014from initiation to closeout. The systematic management of the IT security services process is critically important. Failure to consider and manage the many complex issues involved can seriously impact the organization. IT security decision makers must think about the costs.# IT Security Services Guide\n\nand security requirements, as well as organizational mission and strategic functions, personnel and service provider arrangements. This guide discusses each phase of the IT security services life cycle to provide a starting point for evaluating and selecting sound security practices. The discussion is directed toward a wide variety of organizations with diverse IT security requirements. The guide discusses general topics such as the importance of developing agreements that define the service levels for the service providers; however, this guide does not prescribe the service or service level that best fits the organization's needs. The specific needs of each organization should always be considered when applying the processes and concepts that are presented in this guide.

Finally, in this publication, NIST provides information and advice for decision makers and other relevant parties on the security and policy issues for obtaining IT security services.\n\n## 1.3 Limitations\n\nSection 5 of this document discusses a sampling of possible IT security services but does not represent an exhaustive list. In addition to clearly identified IT security services, organizations may also wish to acquire a service, which contains a significant security component such as systems administration. These types of services are not addressed in this guide; however, the information that is included in this guide can be extended and adapted to cover other related services.\n\nThis guide does not advocate a position for or against the development of external arrangements (such as outsourcing) for IT security services. The reader should refer to OMB Circular A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities, to establish the foundation for the decision whether activities should be performed under contract with a commercial activity or performed in-house using Government facilities and personnel.\n\n## 1.4 Intended Audience\n\nThis guide is meant for organizations that provide IT security services regardless of whether the service is provided from within the organization or procured from an outside provider. The goal is to help IT security decision makers and managers implement and manage the most appropriate IT security services, service levels, and service arrangements to best meet the organization's mission and needs.\n\n## 1.5 Document Organization\n\nThe remainder of this document is organized as follows:",

This chapter discusses the framework of a security services life cycle, an overview of issues to address throughout the life cycle, an overview of the various service arrangements that IT security decision makers could consider, and a look at tools that will be useful to the IT security decision maker in the security services life cycle.\n- **Chapter 4** provides a more in-depth discussion of the issues related to obtaining IT security services. In# The Context of the Security Services Life Cycle\n\nThis chapter discusses how the security service begins, what is captured in assessing the current environment and the needs for any new service, what a service agreement should include, and how a service agreement should end or be discontinued. Chapter 5 provides a more detailed look at a few specific IT security services, serving as an example of the application of the previous information.\n\nIn addition to these chapters, three appendixes are attached:",

Roles and Responsibilities\n\nThe list of participants for selecting, implementing, and managing a given service will depend on the type and scope of the service, the service arrangement, and type/size of organization. A large federal agency that is seeking to partner with an external organization for many of its IT security functions will have different requirements and therefore a more extensive list of participants than a small business seeking a limited-scope IT security training program for its employees. The following roles are generic to many different services. The actual list of participants may be less than or greater than the list provided below. For instance, if an internal group within an organization provides the security service, the contracting officer and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may not have a role.\n\n### 2.1 Chief Information Officer\n\nThe CIO is responsible for the organization's IT planning, budgeting, investment, performance and acquisition. As such, the CIO oversees senior organization personnel in obtaining efficient and effective IT security services.\n\n### 2.2 Contracting Officer\n\nThe Contracting Officer has the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings.\n\n### 2.3 Contracting Officer's Technical Representative",

This individual plays a leading role in introducing an appropriate, structured methodology to# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nhelp identify, evaluate, and minimize IT security risks to the organization. IT security program managers coordinate and perform system risk analyses, analyze risk mitigation alternatives, and build the business case for the acquisition of appropriate security solutions that help ensure mission accomplishment in the face of real-world threats. They also support senior management in ensuring that security management activities are conducted as required to meet the organization's needs.\n\n## 2.6 IT System Security Officer\n\nThe IT System Security Officer is responsible for ensuring the security of an information system throughout its life cycle.\n\n## 2.7 Program Manager (Owner Of Data)/Acquisition Initiator\n\nThis Program Manager represents programmatic interests during the IT security services life cycle. Program Managers play an essential role in security because they have been involved in strategic planning initiatives of the IT security service and are intimately aware of functional service requirements.\n\n## 2.8 Privacy Officer\n\nThe Privacy Officer ensures that the service and service arrangement meet existing privacy policies regarding protection, dissemination (information sharing and exchange) and information disclosure.\n\n## 2.9 Other Participants",

It is vital that all members of the acquisition team work together to ensure that a successful acquisition is achieved. Since the system certifier and accreditor will be making critical decisions near the end of the procurement process, it is helpful to include them earlier in the acquisition so that critical issues can be addressed early. System users may assist in the acquisition by helping the program manager to determine the need, refine the requirements, and inspect and accept the delivered system. Participants may also include personnel who represent information technology, configuration management, design/engineering, and facilities groups.\n\n# 3. IT Security Services\n\nThis chapter provides an overview of IT security services, service arrangements, service issues, and service management tools. These overviews serve as an introduction to the IT security services life cycle discussed in Chapter 4. This life cycle is independent of an organization's decision to use internal resources or an external service provider to perform the service. Ultimately, the organization remains responsible for and affected by any security breach regardless of who performs the security service.\n\n## 3.1 Overview of IT Security Services\n\nSecurity services fall into one of three categories (Table 3-1). The security services life cycle applies to any security service regardless of the category into which it falls and could even apply to an entire IT security category. As managers determine which IT security services need to be implemented, assessed, or discontinued, they should consider the impact on other IT security services. Chapter 5 discusses in greater detail the types of IT security services. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-12, An Introduction to Computer Security:# The NIST Computer Security Handbook",

Chapter 5 discusses in greater detail the types of IT security services. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-12, An Introduction to Computer Security:# The NIST Computer Security Handbook\n\nThe NIST Computer Security Handbook also provides a comprehensive overview of and introduction to computer security and security controls and services.\n\nAn operational example\u2014an organization retains the program oversight of a firewall within the organization, but brings in an external group to handle the day-to-day monitoring of the audit logs. The security arrangement may look different, depending on a person's role. In this example, the firewall manager may view the arrangement as an external one because an outside group performs the audit review service. The organization's top-level business manager may view this as an internal arrangement because the firewall service is implemented internally. The organization's IT security officer may view this as somewhere in the middle of the continuum, a hybrid, seeing both the internal firewall service and its external audit review component.\n\n## 3.2 Overview of IT Security Service Arrangements\n\nSelecting the most appropriate services, service mix, and service level is a complex decision, as is deciding who should provide the needed service. Much of the complexity of this decision stems from the wide range of arrangements from which an organization may choose, though organizational, personnel and other issues discussed in section 3.4 also make the decision less straightforward and increases the complexity.\n\nA broad range of possible service arrangements exists. An organization may select its internal employees and teams to provide the service required, or it may choose to fully export the service to an external service provider. This external service provider could be any organization because this term does not intend to refer to only an external commercial service provider. For example, an organization may choose to employ an external group from a subsidiary organization, a business unit, or a commercial service provider.\n\n## 3.3 Overview Of IT Security Services Management Tools",

Two important tools are metrics and service agreements.\n\n### Overview of Metrics\n\nMetrics are a management tool that facilitates decision-making and accountability through practical and relevant data collection, data analysis, and performance data reporting. The importance of a metrics program is discussed in NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems. A full and complete discussion of computer security metrics is beyond the scope of this document; however, IT security service managers should understand what metrics are and when they should be used.\n\nFor example, a metric for a management service, such as a training and awareness program, might be the percentage of new employees who receive IT security training within their first.# 30 days on the job.\n\nGathering this data repeatedly, over time, will allow managers to assess how well the current training service provider performs its task today, to set targets for the service provider in the future, and then to assess how well it met the desired target. The metrics process is discussed in the next chapter.\n\n## Overview of Service Agreements",

The metrics process is discussed in the next chapter.\n\n## Overview of Service Agreements\n\nA service agreement serves as the agreement between the service provider and the organization requesting the service. As service arrangements become more complex and employ commercial service providers, the formality of the agreement should increase. A fully externalized service arrangement with a commercial entity, for example, will require a formal contract so that managers can hold service providers accountable for their actions. A fully internal service arrangement may require a less formal agreement, perhaps an agreed-on reporting process or an MOA. Regardless of the arrangement, all parties should be aware of their roles and responsibilities. Section 4.4.1 discusses the importance of service agreements.\n\n## 3.4 Overview of IT Security Services Issues\n\nImplementing a security service and service arrangement can be complex. Each security service has its own costs and risks associated with it, as does each service arrangement. Making a decision based on one issue can have major implications for the organization in other areas. The decision makers will have to balance near-term cost/value with potential long-term risks associated with new vulnerabilities, attrition, potential loss of employee productivity/morale and internal functional skills, and other impacts. The degree of completeness of the list of factors and issues considered will vary by organization; however, the factors and issues can be grouped into six categories as identified in Table 3-2. These issues, tools, and arrangements will be discussed repeatedly in this guide because of their importance to providing IT security services.",

These issues, tools, and arrangements will be discussed repeatedly in this guide because of their importance to providing IT security services.\n\n## 3.5 General Considerations for IT Security Services\n\nListed below are some general questions that decision makers should answer to identify the service provider that best meets the organization's needs. These questions have been grouped into the various issue categories described in Section 3.4. These questions are intended as a guide and each organization will need to decide which questions are relevant to its specific needs. The questions are not an exhaustive list and organizations may need to develop additional questions. In some instances, the organization and not the service provider may best answer the question.\n\n## 3.6 Organizational Conflict of Interest\n\nAn organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may exist when a party to an agreement has a past, present or future interest related to the work performed (or to be performed), which may diminish its capacity to provide impartial, technically sound, objective service or results in an unfair competitive advantage. Of course, it is best to avoid organizational conflicts before they arise. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (subpart 9.5) describes two underlying principles why avoiding an OCI is important:# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n- Preventing the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a [service provider's] judgment\n- Preventing unfair competitive advantage",

Although the FAR applies to Federal contracts, any organization should be aware that an OCI could occur in any phase of the IT security services lifecycle and may provide an unfair competitive advantage.\n\n- There are several methods that an organization can take to avoid, neutralize, or minimize the effect of an OCI. They can include: modify or eliminate the offending parts of the agreement, statement of work, contract, etc.\n- Prohibit bidding on a subsequent procurement in which the service provider plays a key role in development of the requirement\n- Prohibit using proprietary or privileged information which the service provider has access to\n- Segment the work within the service provider to prevent involvement in performance of the work or being in a position to influence the work\n- Require the service provider to avoid conduct that may result in an OCI\u2014such as when called on to inspect its own work. The service provider must disclose its relationship and disqualify itself from performing the work\n- Make privileged documents available to all parties. (neutralizing the OCI)",

Identifying the existence of OCIs, mitigating effect of the OCI to an acceptable level, and/or waiving the OCI is important when managing the IT security service life cycle but it can involve complex legal and regulatory issues and should not be considered without the close counsel of an organization's legal department.\n\n## 4. IT Security Services Life Cycle\n\nThe IT security services life cycle provides IT security decision makers and managers with a six-phase process by which they can select, implement, and manage IT security services. This chapter details the various life-cycle phases and the issues and decisions within each phase. As Figure 4-1 illustrates, the security services life cycle has both a linear and iterative component. It proceeds linearly from initiation to implementation to closeout, but the assessment, solution, and operations phases must continually occur for an IT security service to succeed.\n\nThe six phases are described as follows:\n\n- **Phase 1: Initiation**\u2014the need to initiate the services life cycle is recognized. Section 4.1 discusses potential triggers for this phase.\n- **Phase 2: Assessment**\u2014before decision makers can implement a service and select a service provider, an accurate portrait of the current environment must be developed.

This phase has a single step: an event sufficient to warrant assessing the current environment and identifying viable service solutions. The specific trigger that will meet this definition will vary by organization. The trigger will fall into one of the six issue areas listed in Section 3.4: strategy/mission, budgetary/funding, technical/architectural, organizational, personnel, and policy/process. Table 4-1 shows sample trigger events from each issue area.\n\nBusiness, IT, and IT security managers initiate the service life cycle. The decision to obtain a security service should be to obtain the most appropriate security services at the most appropriate level in the most appropriate service arrangement so as to support the business function. The next phase of the life cycle, Assessment, is where it is determined whether the most appropriate service is one performed internally or externally.\n\nAs one IT security services life cycle is initiated, it is likely another life cycle will be ending. To ensure a smooth transition, managers should be aware of possible interactions and effects between the service that is ending and the one that is beginning.\n\n## 4.2 Phase 2: Assessment",

To ensure a smooth transition, managers should be aware of possible interactions and effects between the service that is ending and the one that is beginning.\n\n## 4.2 Phase 2: Assessment\n\nPhase 2, Assessment, shown in Figure 4-3, follows the Initiation Phase. The steps in this phase include baselining the existing environment, analyzing opportunities and barriers, and identifying options and risks. To establish a baseline understanding of the existing environment, the decision makers will need to use metrics and the principle of total cost of ownership (TCO) to ensure the most accurate data will be used for decision-making purposes. This data will also set performance targets and cost estimates for service agreements in later phases.\n\nBearing in mind the metrics and full cost of a service, the decision makers begin to consider opportunities and barriers. The IT security service issues mentioned in Section 3.4 provide a# Framework for Analyzing Opportunities and Barriers\n\nOpportunities and barriers, as well as external factors, such as the marketplace and the customers. Finally, the existing environment and the opportunities and barriers will provide managers with options and risks. From these options, managers will choose a solution in Phase 3.\n\n## 4.2.1 Baseline Existing Environment\n\nOnce managers have initiated the IT security services life cycle, they must establish a baseline understanding of the current environment. This baseline will demonstrate to managers how well the current arrangement meets the security requirement and at what cost. Managers will need these two measurements to compare the benefits of various service arrangements or the proposals of various service providers.\n\nThe scope of this effort will depend on the nature of the security control or the specific mix of controls. All related areas of the control or the mix of controls should be included; for example, if an organization is evaluating its firewall services, it should evaluate its firewall policies and other policies, the effectiveness of the firewall architecture, and other issues specific to the study.",

As current stakeholders, they have an interest in the status quo, and their data-gathering techniques or reporting methods may reflect this intentionally or unintentionally. Formal tools such as metrics and TCO will help minimize any inadvertent biases in the data collection efforts. Additionally, a review of existing past metrics and data will be helpful in removing any bias when baselining the current environment.\n\n### 4.2.1.1 Metrics Creation, Gathering, and Analysis\n\nMetrics provide decision makers with objective, quantifiable data. The importance of metrics starts in this phase and continues throughout the life cycle.\n\nMetrics creation starts with defining the \"what\" to measure: the metrics should map to the organization's overall functional and security goals and relate to the desired outcomes that the service will provide.

Metrics for any service should include data related to the following:\n\n- **Implementation Level**\u2014implementation-level metrics quantify the degree of completion of required and agreed-on activities and within agreed-on timeframes.\n- **Service Level**\u2014these metrics quantify the timeliness of service delivery (i.e., average time to restore operations or number of hours to reconfigure a firewall).\n- **Effectiveness**\u2014effectiveness metrics are outcome factors that describe how well the services were delivered and their efficacy (i.e., customer service ratings, security intrusion and blockage levels, and the number of systems affected by computer viruses).\n- **Business Impact**\u2014business impact metrics quantify the effect on business parameters such as financial and operational resources (i.e., dollars lost from virus attacks, work time lost from server outages).\n\nAdditional considerations for the development of metrics include:```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n- Consider only those metrics that are practical to collect\n- Base metrics only on obtainable and quantifiable events\n- Consider all IT security service aspects from technical functionality to problem resolution procedures to appropriateness of personnel\n- Base metrics on business operation objectives\n- Provide sufficient insight into assessing the level of IT security services provided/offered and allow for a relevant comparison between service options\n- Gather metrics to assess the causes, not only results\n- Gather metrics to track trends.\n\nNIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides more detail about the characteristics of useful metrics, as well as the importance of having a mature (or maturing) metrics program. The importance of a repeatable, consistent metrics approach to IT security will become apparent in the IT security services life cycle as the organization sets targets, writes service agreements, and monitors service provider performance in Phases 3, 4 and 5, respectively.\n\n## 4.2.1.2 Total Cost of Ownership",
  "NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides more detail about the characteristics of useful metrics, as well as the importance of having a mature (or maturing) metrics program. The importance of a repeatable, consistent metrics approach to IT security will become apparent in the IT security services life cycle as the organization sets targets, writes service agreements, and monitors service provider performance in Phases 3, 4 and 5, respectively.\n\n## 4.2.1.2 Total Cost of Ownership\n\nIn conjunction with a metrics program, the IT security services decision makers need to identify the full cost of the service. Metrics may be a part of this effort because they can help determine the dollar cost of various actions (e.g., cost of downtime, costs of a virus attack). The principle of full cost is often referred to as TCO. TCO includes not only implementation and operational costs but also related costs (e.g., overhead, salaries, benefits, technology upgrades, and software support, and maintenance). This information will allow decision makers to compare the costs of other service arrangements with the existing environment during the business case development in the solution phase. When the full cost is identified, the decision makers will be able to accurately relate the value of one service option over another.\n\n## 4.2.2 Analyze Opportunities and Barriers\n\nOnce the organization understands the current environment from a performance and cost perspective, it can begin to analyze opportunities and barriers. Analyzing opportunities and barriers allows the organization to identify functions and areas that can change, those that cannot, and reasons for each. IT security stakeholders should participate in the process and approve analysis results. Properly performed, an analysis should include the following:\n\n- **Strategic/Mission**: Identify how critical the service/function is to the business.\n- **Budgetary/Funding**: Articulate a rational, executable fiscal program, in accordance with all applicable regulations and legislation to secure approval and funding by budget authorities.\n- **Technical/Architectural**: Determine and understand the importance of maintaining an organization's technical competencies.\n- **Organizational**: Determine which service arrangements would be appropriate for the organization's work environment and values.\n- Allow management to incorporate intangible benefits to all stakeholders (e.g., improved employee morale, organizational image) into the business case that will be developed.\n- **Personnel**: Allow all stakeholders to develop and translate overarching.\n```# Performance Goals",

The baseline showed the current environment, and the opportunities and barriers step began to describe the desired target. In this step, the \"how-to\" becomes clearer.\n\nThe \"how-to\" step will determine the service arrangement. As discussed in Chapter 3, organizations may fulfill a security service requirement using various security service arrangements\u2014from using only internal teams and staff to fully outsourcing for the security service. At this life-cycle phase, many organizations will still need to consider many options and various service arrangements. For each of these, the organization needs to identify the benefits and risks.\n\nFinally, the evidence may suggest the current arrangement and service level are effective and/or appropriate. It is most important to focus on business function, customers, and effective security. The choices made should best support these three focus points. Improving business and IT processes will likely be more effective and less risky than changing the service arrangement; organizations should not seek to change the current environment unless the assessment identifies improvement areas that can be met only by implementing a change in service, service arrangement, or service provider.\n\n## 4.3 Phase 3: Solution\n\nFigure 4-4 illustrates Phase 3, Solution, of the IT security services life cycle.",

Before specifying the solution, decision makers will need to develop a detailed business case for each possibility to be considered.\n\nThe business case will provide managers with the cost, benefit, and organizational risk perspective of each alternative. Comparing the costs, benefits and organizational risks will allow managers to identify a preferred solution. The implementation plan will provide managers with the means for identifying the service provider and implementing the service.\n\n### 4.3.1 Develop the Business Case\n\nDuring the assessment phase, the decision makers identified the current environment. To identify the preferred desired future state in this solution phase, a business case needs to be developed. The business case should provide the information necessary to identify the best solution among the alternatives. Each organization will likely have a unique methodology for developing a business case, however there are five components common to most business cases:\n\n- **Alternative Analysis**\u2014the organization should look at all of the available options. The organization will finalize the options deemed viable enough to develop formal cost estimates, benefits analysis, and organizational risk analysis.\n- **Cost Estimate**\u2014the organization needs to develop TCO estimates for each.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Alternative\n\nEstimates of each alternative and the current environment must be consistent, have similar cost elements, and be based on the same assumptions.",

These should be quantitative (i.e., cost savings, cost avoidance etc.), whenever possible. For example, if the organization estimates a new service implementation will lower security incident rates by 50% and each incident costs x dollars (based on metrics gathered during the assessment phase), the organization can identify the likely cost avoidance. It will also be important to look at qualitative benefits such as impact to mission, customers, etc.\n\n- **Project Risk Analysis**\u2014along with the benefits of each alternative, project risks must be identified. OMB has identified eight standard risk categories: organizational and change management risk, business risk, data/information risk, technology risk, strategic risk, security risk, privacy risk, project resources risk. These risks might include cost overruns, schedule slippage, vendor uncertainties, privacy concerns, etc. The analysis of risks should evaluate all alternatives against the same risk factors and determine the probability of occurrence and the impact if it occurred. Then, the organization should determine the risk-adjusted cost of each alternative.\n\n- **Evaluation of Alternatives**\u2014finally, the organization should rank each alternative based on cost, benefit and risk. From this analysis, the organization should be able to identify the preferred alternative.\n\n## 4.3.2 Develop the Service Arrangement",

Although the business case may not make the decision-making easy or obvious, it should provide the necessary data for decision makers to weigh, consider, and select the service arrangement that best suits the organization's needs. There will likely be some discussion and disagreement among the decision makers, but ultimately the selection must be a consensus. A service arrangement can succeed only if all business and IT security managers sufficiently buy-in to the implementing solution.\n\n## 4.3.3 Develop the Implementation Plan\n\nAt this time, the parties should determine the budget and scope of the service arrangement and begin to develop the implementation plan. The implementation plan provides a roadmap for the organization on moving from the current environment to the desired future environment. The implementation plan should address the following:\n\n- **Project Management Roles and Responsibilities**\u2014the implementation plan should identify the roles and responsibilities of individuals with project management roles and responsibilities for both the implementation and operations phases.\n\n- **Budget and Scope**\u2014IT security managers should identify the budgets and scope of the service arrangement.

The exit strategy should provide action plans for normal, planned exits, such as service agreement expiration; unexpected terminations, such as service provider bankruptcy; and potentially tension-filled exits, such as poor service provider performance.\n\n## Transition Management\nTransition management plans should document the organization's efforts to manage the transition from the current to the desired future environment.

These costs should be considered when transition plans are developed.\n\n## Phase 4: Implementation\nSelecting the service arrangement and service provider may actually be the easy part of the IT security life cycle. Creating metrics and gathering data may require considerable work, especially if a metrics program is not already in place. Although the multitude of service arrangements may seem overwhelming, the objective data and methodical analysis will likely make clear the best path. Implementing those decisions requires preparation and care. Managers should develop explicit service agreements and ensure careful execution of the implementation plan. Careful planning and execution will increase the chance of success, but as the service moves to the operations phase, the leadership should manage expectations. No service arrangement will fix a problem overnight and no service provider can be expected to debut perfectly.\n\n### Identify Service Provider and Develop Service Agreement\nDuring the solution phase, the security decision makers select the service arrangement. In this phase, they need to identify the service provider. How they do this will vary by organization, service arrangement, and type of service agreement.

For hybrid and external service arrangements, organizations may wish to identify.# Several Potential Service Providers\n\nand elicit proposals.

Large government organizations may release an RFP and accept formal proposals for external service arrangements. Regardless of what specific agreement methods an organization chooses to use, some basic steps apply to most situations:\n\n## Performance-Based Acquisition\n\nPerformance-based acquisition has emerged as a preferred method for engaging external service providers for many arrangements. Performance-based acquisition provides greater flexibility to service providers in suggesting an appropriate solution. Rather than requiring that a service provider to answer an RFP that specifies job positions, employee requirements, and methodologies, the organization asks the service provider to provide a cost-efficient method. The metrics identified in early phases, for example, could be turned into a statement of objectives to which the competing service providers answer with their own SOW and the cost of meeting the objectives. This is in contrast to more traditional acquisition methods where the organization would write a SOW, and the service provider would respond by indicating how much it would cost to perform that work. By placing more responsibility on the service provider, the organization is able to assess a much broader and deeper set of solutions, increasing the likelihood of finding a suitable service provider.\n\n### Establish Service Provider Service Level Targets\n\nHaving identified and captured the relevant data in the baseline phase, and developed the direction of the desired future environment, the IT security managers should determine the performance targets they want the service provider to meet. These service levels will be further negotiated with the service provider and formally documented in the service agreement.\n\n### Elicit Service Provider Proposals\n\nThe organization may identify potential service providers in numerous ways. If the service area has few providers or exists in a new market, the organization may solicit all of the service providers in the field for quotes and their service offering. The organization may also announce an RFP and direct interested parties to provide cost proposals. Regardless of the method, the organization should try to consider as many service providers as possible to encourage competition. The organization may want to ask service providers to answer some of the questions from section 3.5 of this guide.\n\n### Assess the Proposals and Service Providers",

Although the cost of the proposal may well be a leading factor, managers need to balance cost with value, reputation of the service provider, past performance of the service provider, and ability of the service provider to support the mission of the acquiring organization. The organization also needs to ensure that the methodologies, service levels, and costs are in line with its expectations and that they are feasible.

The data collected during the assessment phase should be used to capture the performance level of this new service provider. During the operations phase, the desired future arrangement becomes the current arrangement.\n\nThe targets set forth in the service agreement should be compared with the metrics gathered. Although metrics will provide service-level targets, the organization may also want to use end user evaluations or customer satisfaction level surveys to evaluate performance. The IT security managers will have to work with other operational managers (such as customer service managers) to ensure that the service provider is meeting service targets. The IT security managers also need to ensure service providers are complying with IT security policy and processes, as well as applicable laws and regulations. IT security managers must ensure during the operations phase that the service provider does not compromise private, confidential, personal, or mission-sensitive data. Compliance reports will help with this effort. The service agreement should have included clauses that specify penalties and/or remedies for noncompliance and management should employ these when the service provider does not perform as the contract dictates.\n\n#### 4.5.2 Monitor and Measure Organization Performance\n\nWhile the service provider should meet the targets set forth in the service agreements, the IT security managers must look beyond the service and service provider to the entire IT.# Security Function and Organization\n\nThe IT security function should have a mix of several IT services at various levels (management, operational, and technical) and a service arrangement has technical, policy, cultural, personnel, and other impacts.

The monitoring and measures of the service provider and organization will allow IT security stakeholders to evaluate the organization's performance and seek ways to improve, even when meeting the targets. The world of IT security services is ever changing and security arrangements and agreements also need to change.\n\n## 4.6 Phase 6: Closeout\n\nAs mentioned during the initiation phase, life cycles may overlap. As one IT security service, service arrangement, or agreement ends, another may begin. Depending on the reason for ending a service, a difficult management situation could exist. Exiting service providers may not always have the best interests of the organization in mind and may not make it easy for those replacing them. Therefore, IT security managers need to be sure to select the appropriate exit strategy and implement it well.\n\nFigure 4-7 illustrates Phase 6, Closeout, of the IT security services life cycle.\n\n### 4.6.1 Select Appropriate Exit Strategy\n\nAs mentioned during the development of the exit strategy, an organization should have several exit strategies prepared and ready for implementation (section 4.3.3). Often, an organization will be able to plan in advance for the exit: the service provider and the organization have an agreed-on contract that expires in 6 months, for example. However, this will not always be the case. The service arrangement may not succeed as managers hoped, the service provider may not meet the targets, a new technology may debut, or the service provider may even have suddenly filed for bankruptcy.

The exit strategy will best assure a careful ending and provide lessons-learned for desired future IT security service implementations.\n\n# 5. Types of Services\n\nAn effective IT security program should encompass multiple layers of protection. An organization should evaluate the value and criticality of its information systems and determine the security controls that are appropriate to the level of risk. A security program, whether at the organizational or individual system level, should include an appropriate mixture of security controls: management, operational, and technical. Reliance on technical resources alone will be insufficient without complementary management or operational controls.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nThis section presents examples of management, operational, and technical services that are discussed in this document.

In many cases, the issues and considerations provided for the services presented in this guide may be used or modified for other security services.\n\n## 5.1 Management Security Services\n\n### 5.1.1 IT Security Program Development\n\nAn IT security program is a set of security controls, which can be grouped under the terms management, operational, and technical. Federal law and regulations, such as the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, OMB Circular A-130, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources, and other government-wide policies, standards, and procedures issued by the OMB, NIST, and other agencies establish the policies, standards, and procedures for federal organizations.\n\nBecause policy is typically written at a broad level, organizations must also develop standards, guidelines, and procedures that provide employees with a clear approach to implementing policy. Standards and guidelines specify technologies and methodologies that will be used to secure systems; procedures are detailed steps to be followed to accomplish particular security-related tasks. Standards, guidelines, and procedures may be distributed throughout an organization via handbooks, regulations, or manuals.\n\nTogether, these documents will ensure that employees are aware of their role in IT security and comply with the IT security program.\n\n#### IT Security Program Services\n\nService providers can assist organization decision makers in developing and maintaining an organization-wide security program, helping to ensure effective implementation of the program, evaluate the performance of major organization components, and provide appropriate security training of organization employees with significant security responsibilities. The service providers can also perform independent evaluations and audits of an organization IT security program.\n\nA comprehensive IT security program service can consist of many elements that will depend on the specific needs of the organization and the relative maturity of its IT security program. The elements of an IT security program service may include the following:",

NIST SP 800-12 categorizes IT Security Policy into three basic types:\n\n- **Program Policy**\u2014high-level policy used to create an organization's IT security program, define its scope within the organization, assign implementation responsibilities, establish strategic direction, and assign resources for implementation.\n- **Issue-Specific Policies**\u2014address specific issues of concern to the organization, such as contingency planning, the use of a particular methodology for systems risk management, and implementation of new regulations or law. These policies are likely to require more frequent revision as changes in technology and related factors take place.\n- **System-Specific Policies**\u2014address individual systems, such as establishing an access control list or in training users as to what system actions are permitted. These policies may vary from system to system within the same organization. In addition, policy may refer to entirely different matters, such as the specific managerial decisions setting an organization's electronic mail (e-mail) policy or fax security policy.\n\n## IT Security Policy Services\n\nService providers can assist organizations in analyzing existing and developing new security policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures. The authority for approving policy is inherently a core function of an organization and therefore final approval of policies should be performed by the organization. Given this constraint, organizations should limit service providers, either internal or external, to assistance and support.

NIST SP 800-30 notes that the primary goal of risk management is to \"balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by protecting IT systems and data.\"\n\n### Risk Management Services\n\nService providers offer various combinations of service packages for supporting risk management activities. The service provider may develop risk management guidance for supporting an organization's risk management program. The service provider may manage the risk management program as a whole but the organization should always retain the responsibility for the program. The service provider may also perform a risk assessment and/or develop a risk mitigation plan. If the organization already has a mature and operational risk management program, the service provider may audit the program for effectiveness.\n\n## 5.1.4 IT Security Architecture\n\nSecurity architecture refers to the strategic planning and development of an IT infrastructure that supports the mission and the security objectives. It is a process that is developed during the security design phase after a security requirements analysis has been conducted to support it.\n\n### IT Security Architecture Services",

It is a process that is developed during the security design phase after a security requirements analysis has been conducted to support it.\n\n### IT Security Architecture Services\n\nIf the organization asks a service provider to design a new security architecture, the service provider must have access to the technology and security baseline of the organization's current architecture. The service provider can conduct baselining if it has not already been done by the organization. Baselining services include identifying its business needs, functional requirements, security requirements, and risk assessments, as well as the security controls in place. A service provider can identify security controls and identify and assess technologies that will enforce the organization's security policies. A service provider can develop a methodology for selecting the security solutions that best serve the organization's needs and design a technical architecture. Finally, the service provider should document the security architecture.\n\n## 5.1.5 Certification and Accreditation\n\nAccreditation is the formal declaration by an authorizing official that a system is approved to operate at an acceptable level of risk and in a particular environment using a prescribed set of technical, managerial, and operational safeguards to an acceptable level of risk. Accreditation is usually supported by a technical security evaluation, a risk assessment, a contingency plan, and signed rules of behavior.

When products cannot be found on existing validated product lists, it may be possible that other parties have evaluated a particular product.\n\nIn many cases, it is not cost effective to conduct comprehensive security evaluations for the one-time use of an IT security product unless that product will be used extensively throughout an organization and therefore, products on the validated product list should be considered as an alternative. Additional information regarding security assurance can be obtained from NIST SP 800-23, Guidelines to Federal Organizations on Security Assurance and Acquisition/Use of Tested/Evaluated Products.\n\n### IT Security Product Evaluation Services\n\nThe NIAP CCEVS employs a network of private sector, accredited testing laboratories to independently evaluate commercial security products in a variety of key technology areas against a set of security requirements and specifications from the international standard, International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 15408, Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation.

Networked computing has changed the scope and focus of what# Contingency Planning\n\nContingency planning has traditionally been a local issue. Contingency planning is designed to reduce the consequences of any loss of data or infrastructure. Contingency planning enables organization personnel to restore critical IT functions and connectivity rapidly, effectively, and safely. The contingency plan defines the procedures, resources, tasking, and information required for performing recovery actions in response to a broad range of events.\n\nA well-executed and tested contingency plan also gives confidence that critical resources will be available when needed and facilitates an organization's continuity of operations in an emergency situation. The plan is a living document that must be updated regularly to reflect changes to the system's configuration and operations. Additional information on contingency planning is provided in NIST SP 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems. This guide discusses various contingency plans that will help sustain and recover critical IT services following an emergency.\n\n## Main Components of a Contingency Plan\n\nThe contingency plan should address, at a minimum, the following five main components: supporting information, notification/activation, recovery, reconstitution, and supporting appendixes.",

In considering whether to contract out contingency planning services, the organization could conduct a cost-benefit analysis for each breakdown of the service offering (e.g., develop, update and test, and execute the contingency plan).\n\n- **Develop**\u2014service providers can develop the organization's contingency plan. This service requires gathering information from many functional areas. The vendor's first step should be to perform a business impact assessment (BIA) to determine the system's internal and external dependencies, allowable outage times, and recovery priorities. The BIA provides a basis for developing the specific recovery strategy and procedures that comprise the heart of the contingency plan.\n\n- **Update and Test**\u2014updating the plan as needed is critical to its success because the contingency plan is a living document. It is very common to retain the same service provider that developed the plan to update and test it.

Results of the testing exercise would be documented in the contingency plan and discussed with management. The results will determine the effectiveness of the contingency procedures and present any flaws. Staff must be trained in their contingency-related duties so that when an unexpected event interrupts operations, recovery will be easier and people will know what to expect.\n\n- **Execute**\u2014the responsibility for the execution phase of contingency planning lies with the organization, but service providers may support certain aspects of the execution phase. For example, an organization may outsource data recovery because service providers can provide hot or mobile sites for system and data recovery. They may provide periodic training to organization personnel on the plan and their roles in the plan.\n\n## 5.2.2 Incident Handling\n\nAn IT security incident is an adverse event in a computer system or network caused by the failure of a security mechanism or an attempted or threatened breach of these mechanisms. An incident-handling capability can provide the ability to react quickly and efficiently to disruptions in normal processing. Effective incident handling can be achieved by developing and instituting effective processes and procedures for the six phases of incident response: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and follow-up. The incident handling process should be consistent and compatible with any forensic services that the organization may require to ensure that critical evidence is handled properly.\n\n### Incident-Handling Services",

A complete and exhaustive discussion of testing is beyond the scope of this document. Testing is the only way to validate that the security measures and procedures are working as intended. Testing can also assist in identifying previously unknown weaknesses or vulnerabilities. All test activities, whether manual or automatic, require human involvement and thus could be provided as a service.\n\nThe results of testing can be used in the following ways:\n- As a reference point for any corrective action\n- As a benchmarking tool to enable the organization to track its progress\n- To assess implementation of system security requirements\n- For cost-benefit analysis\n- As an input into the larger life-cycle activities, such as risk assessments, functional requirements analysis, C&A, and performance improvement efforts.\n\nCategories of testing can include the following:\n- Network mapping\n- Log review\n- Vulnerability scanning\n- Integrity checkers\n- Penetration testing\n- Virus detection\n- ST&E\n- War dialing\n- Password cracking",

However, because it is a highly invasive measure, it is important that service providers be capable and trusted by the organization. Testing can be conducted as a separate activity or as part of the risk management program, under risk assessment. The service provider will need clear and unambiguous direction from management (a written \"rules of engagement\"), a set of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and clearly defined scope for testing as well as input on what is required for planning and assessment, requirements analysis, test execution, and analysis results and documentation.\n\n### 5.2.4 Training\nTraining is one of the most critical components in maintaining the security posture of operational systems. Securing any organization's IT systems cannot be achieved without skilled, knowledgeable, and trained personnel at all levels. Security training and education must be considered an ongoing effort that is an integral part of conducting business. With constantly evolving technology, education\u2014especially in the security arena\u2014must keep pace with the perpetual changes and advances. Managers must understand the current status of their security programs and controls to make informed judgments and investments to appropriately mitigate risks to an acceptable level. All users of IT systems must be aware of their responsibilities for protecting information and IT resources.\n\nThe IT Security Learning Continuum from NIST SP 800-16, Information Technology Security Training# Requirements\n\nRequirements, and shown in Figure 5-1, represents instructional guidance for IT security awareness, training, and education programs.

An IDS performs a variety of functions:\n\n- Monitor user and system activity\n- Audit system configuration and vulnerabilities\n- Assess integrity of critical system and data files\n- Recognize activity patterns reflecting known attacks\n- Perform statistical analyses for abnormal activity patterns\n- Provide operating system audit trail management, with recognition of user activity reflecting policy violations\n- Provide customized reports.\n\nThis ongoing monitoring and assessment is a necessary part of an overall security architecture. IDSs generally improve the integrity of other parts of the information security infrastructure by identifying specific indications of a possible attack and causing a reexamination of defenses. They can often trace user activity from the point of entry into the network to point of exit. IDSs can recognize specific types of attacks and alert appropriate staff (if configured to do so).\n\n## Intrusion Detection Services\n\nTo be effective, intrusion detection requires a robust knowledge base of attack signatures against which the IDS can tally its findings. Threats and vulnerabilities are not static in nature and are continuously changing and evolving. The attack signatures database should be updated frequently for the IDS to be able to detect the most recent threats. Service providers may have greater leverage to accomplish this at less cost because several customers can share the overhead of maintaining the database for a single IDS product. IDSs require a high level of expertise to operate and manage. If the nature of the intrusion is such that the IDS or the service provider is incapable of resolving the matter or the contract does not require the service provider to resolve the problem, the service provider can contact the organization, which in turn escalates the case for resolution.\n\n## 5.3.3 Public Key Infrastructure",

PKI is an approach (consisting of products, services, facilities, policies, procedures, agreements, and people) that addresses these security needs and makes use of the scalable and distributed characteristics of PKI. PKI allows organizations to conduct business electronically with the confidence that:\n\n- The person or process identified as sending the transaction is actually the originator (nonrepudiation)\n- The person or process receiving the transaction is the intended recipient (identification and authentication)\n- Data integrity has not been compromised (integrity).\n\nIn addition to the three services mentioned above, a PKI can also provide two additional services: key recovery and privilege/authorization.\n\n- Key Recovery\u2014organizations must be able to recover data that the employee has.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nEncrypted, which can only be done by recovering the encryption key when the key is unavailable.\n\n## Privilege/Authorization\n\nCertificates can be used to vouch for a user's identity and also specify privileges the user has been granted.\n\nFunctional elements of a public key infrastructure include certification authorities (CA), registration authorities (RA), repositories, and archives. The nature of PKI is that it is a very technical security control. Several detailed NIST publications exist that further describe PKI:",
