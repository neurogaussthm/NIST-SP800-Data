  "# Executive Summary\n\nLike any information technology (IT), radio frequency identification (RFID) presents security and privacy risks that must be carefully mitigated through management, operational, and technical controls in order to realize the numerous benefits the technology has to offer. When practitioners adhere to sound security engineering principles, RFID technology can help a wide range of organizations and individuals realize substantial productivity gains and efficiencies. These organizations and individuals include hospitals and patients, retailers and customers, and manufacturers and distributors throughout the supply chain. This document provides an overview of RFID technology, the associated security and privacy risks, and recommended practices that will enable organizations to realize productivity improvements while safeguarding sensitive information and protecting the privacy of individuals. While RFID security is a rapidly evolving field with a number of promising innovations expected in the coming years, these guidelines focus on controls that are commercially available today.\n\nRFID is a form of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technology that uses electric or magnetic fields at radio frequencies to transmit information. An RFID system can be used to identify many types of objects, such as manufactured goods, animals, and people. Each object that needs to be identified has a small object known as an RFID tag affixed to it or embedded within it. The tag has a unique identifier and may optionally hold additional information about the object. Devices known as RFID readers wirelessly communicate with the tags to identify the item connected to each tag and possibly read or update additional information stored on the tag. This communication can occur without optical line of sight and over greater distances than other AIDC technologies. RFID technologies support a wide range of applications\u2014everything from asset management and tracking to access control and automated payment.\n\nEvery RFID system includes a radio frequency (RF) subsystem, which is composed of tags and readers. In many RFID systems, the RF subsystem is supported by an enterprise subsystem that is composed of middleware, analytic systems, and networking services. RFID systems that share information across organizational boundaries, such as supply chain applications, also have an inter-enterprise subsystem. Each RFID system has different components and customizations so that it can support a particular business process for an organization; as a result, the security risks for RFID systems and the controls available to address them are highly varied. The enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems involve common IT components such as servers, databases, and networks and therefore can benefit from typical IT security controls for those components.",

For example, protecting the information used to conduct financial transactions in an automated payment system requires different security controls than those used for protecting the information needed to track livestock. Factors to consider include:\n\n## Factors to Consider\n\n- The general functional objective of the RFID technology. For example, does the system need to determine the location of an object or the presence of an object, authenticate a person, perform a financial transaction, or ensure that certain items are not separated?\n- The nature of the information that the RFID system processes or generates. One application may only need to have a unique, static identifier value for each tagged object, while another application may need to store additional information about each tagged object over time. The sensitivity of the information is also an important consideration.\n- The physical and technical environment at the time RFID transactions occur. This includes the distance between the readers and the tags, and the amount of time in which each transaction must be performed.\n- The physical and technical environment before and after RFID transactions take place. For example, human and environmental threats may pose risks to tags' integrity while the tagged objects are in storage or in transit. Some applications require the use of tags with sensors that can track environmental conditions over time, such as temperature and humidity.\n- The economics of the business process and RFID system. The economic factors for RFID systems are different than those for traditional IT systems. For example, many RFID tags offer few or no security features; selecting tags that incorporate basic security functionality significantly increases the cost of tags, especially if encryption features are needed. Also, the operational cost of some basic IT security controls, such as setting unique passwords and changing them regularly, may be higher for RFID systems because of the logistical challenges in managing security for thousands or millions of tags.\n\n## Managing Risk in RFID Implementations",
  "## Managing Risk in RFID Implementations\n\nFor RFID implementations to be successful, organizations should effectively manage their risk. Like other technologies, RFID technology enables organizations to significantly change their business processes to increase efficiency and effectiveness. This technology is complex and combines a number of different computing and communications technologies. Both the changes to business process and the complexity of the technology generate risk. The major risks associated with RFID systems are as follows:\n\n- **Business process risk.** Direct attacks on RFID system components potentially could undermine the business processes the RFID system was designed to enable. For example, a warehouse that relies solely on RFID to track items in its inventory may not be able to process orders in a timely fashion if the RFID system fails.# Business Intelligence Risks\n\n- **Business intelligence risk.** An adversary or competitor potentially could gain unauthorized access to RFID-generated information and use it to harm the interests of the organization implementing the RFID system. For example, an adversary might use an RFID reader to determine whether a shipping container holds expensive electronic equipment, and then target the container for theft when it gets a positive reading.\n\n- **Privacy risk.** Personal privacy rights or expectations may be compromised if an RFID system uses what is considered personally identifiable information for a purpose other than originally intended or understood. As people possess more tagged items and networked RFID readers become ever more prevalent, organizations may have the ability to combine and correlate data across applications to infer personal identity and location and build personal profiles in ways that increase the privacy risk.\n\n- **Externality risk.** RFID technology potentially could represent a threat to non-RFID networked or collocated systems, assets, and people. For example, an adversary could gain unauthorized access to computers on an enterprise network through Internet Protocol (IP) enabled RFID readers if the readers are not designed and configured properly.\n\nOrganizations need to assess the risks they face and choose an appropriate mix of management, operational, and technical security controls for their environments. These organizational assessments should take into account many factors, such as regulatory requirements, the magnitude of each threat, and cost and performance implications of the technology or operational practice. Privacy regulations and guidance are often complex and change over time. Organizations planning, implementing, or managing an RFID system should always consult with the organization's privacy officer, legal counsel, and chief information officer.",

Privacy regulations and guidance are often complex and change over time. Organizations planning, implementing, or managing an RFID system should always consult with the organization's privacy officer, legal counsel, and chief information officer.\n\nWhen securing an RFID system, organizations should select security controls that are compatible with the RFID technologies they currently deploy or purchase new RFID technologies that support the necessary controls. To be most effective, RFID security controls should be incorporated throughout the entire life cycle of RFID systems\u2014from policy development and design to operations and retirement. However, many RFID products support only a fraction of the possible protection mechanisms. Tags, in particular, have very limited computing capabilities. Most tags supporting asset management applications do not support authentication, access control, or encryption techniques commonly found in other business IT systems.\n\nRFID standards specify security features including passwords to protect access to certain tag commands and memory, but the level of security offered differs across these standards. Vendors also offer proprietary security features, including proprietary extensions to standards-based technologies, but they are not always compatible with other components of the system. Careful planning and procurement is necessary to ensure an organization's RFID system meets its security objectives.\n\n## 1.

Readers who already have a strong understanding of RFID technology and...# Applications can skip this section and the discussion in Section 3 about RFID applications.\n\n## 2.1 Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) Technology\n\nIdentification processes that rely on AIDC technologies are significantly more reliable and less expensive than those that are not automated. The most common AIDC technology is bar code technology, which uses optical scanners to read labels. Most people have direct experience with bar codes because they have seen cashiers scan items at supermarkets and retail stores. Bar codes are an enormous improvement over ordinary text labels because personnel are no longer required to read numbers or letters on each label or manually enter data into an IT system; they just have to scan the label.\n\nThe innovation of bar codes greatly improved the speed and accuracy of the identification process and facilitated better management of inventory and pricing when coupled with information systems. RFID represents a technological advancement in AIDC because it offers advantages that are not available in other AIDC systems such as bar codes. RFID offers these advantages because it relies on radio frequencies to transmit information rather than light, which is required for optical AIDC technologies.\n\nThe use of radio frequencies means that RFID communication can occur:\n- Without optical line of sight, because radio waves can penetrate many materials,\n- At greater speeds, because many tags can be read quickly, whereas optical technology often requires time to manually reposition objects to make their bar codes visible, and\n- Over greater distances, because many radio technologies can transmit and receive signals more effectively than optical technology under most operating conditions.",

For example, several retail firms have pilot RFID programs to determine the contents of a shopping cart without removing each item and placing it near a scanner, as is typical at most stores today. In this case, the ability to scan a cart without removing its contents could speed up the checkout process, thereby decreasing transaction costs for the retailers. This application of RFID also has the potential to significantly decrease checkout time for consumers.\n\nRFID products often support other features that bar codes and other AIDC technologies do not have, such as rewritable memory, security features, and environmental sensors that enable the RFID technology to record a history of events. The types of events that can be recorded include temperature changes, sudden shocks, or high humidity. Today, people typically perceive the label identifying a particular object of interest as static, but RFID technology can make this label dynamic or even \"smart\" by enabling the label to acquire data about the object even when people are not present to handle it.\n\n## 2.2 RFID System Components\n\nRFID systems can be very complex, and implementations vary greatly across industries and sectors.

An RFID system supporting a supply chain application is a common example of an RFID system with an inter-enterprise subsystem. In a supply chain application, a tagged product is tracked throughout its life cycle, from manufacture to final purchase, and sometimes even afterwards (e.g., to support targeted product recalls).\n\nThe characteristics of RFID enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems are very similar to those of any networked IT system in terms of the types of computers that reside on them, the protocols they support, and the security issues they encounter.\n\nSections 2.3 through 2.5 review each of the subsystems in more detail.\n\n## 2.3 RF Subsystem\n\nTo enable wireless identification, the RF subsystem consists of two components:\n\n- RFID tags (sometimes referred to as transponders), which are small electronic devices that are affixed to objects or embedded in them. Each tag has a unique identifier and may also have other features such as memory to store additional data, environmental sensors, and security mechanisms.\n- RFID readers, which are devices that wirelessly communicate with tags to identify the item connected to each tag and possibly associate the tagged item with related data.",

Figure 2-1 shows a simple RF subsystem configuration.\n\nSections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 discuss tag and reader characteristics in more detail. Section 2.3.3 explains the fundamentals of tag-reader communication.\n\n### 2.3.1 Tag Characteristics\n\nThe market for RFID tags includes numerous different types of tags, which differ greatly in their cost, size, performance, and security mechanisms. Even when tags are designed to comply with a particular standard, they are often further customized to meet the requirements of specific applications.\n\nUnderstanding the major tag characteristics can help those responsible for RFID systems identify the tag characteristics required in their environments and applications.

There are a number of data formats available for encoding identifiers on tags. System designers often want to use# Identifiers\n\nIdentifiers that have a standard structure, with certain groups of bits representing particular fields. A tag identifier format that is used across many industry sectors is the Electronic Product Code (EPC). This format was developed by the industry group EPCglobal. EPCglobal is a joint venture between Global Standards One (GS1), which was formerly known as European Article Numbering (EAN) International, and GS1 US, which was formerly known as the Uniform Code Council (UCC). The tag identifier format consists of four data fields:\n\n- The Header, which specifies the EPC type,\n- The EPC Manager ID, which uniquely identifies the organization that is responsible for assigning the object class and serial number bits (often the manufacturer of the item),\n- The Object Class, which identifies a class of objects, such as a certain model of television set, and\n- The Serial Number, which uniquely describes the instance of that class of objects (e.g., a particular television set).\n\nUsing a standard identifier format makes it easier for organizations to decode identifiers. When a machine reads a standard identifier, it can parse the identifier and decode its fields. The machine may need to request information from a remote computer to look up an identifier. When the database is distributed across several organizations and many servers, a standard identifier format with specified fields greatly facilitates the lookup process. Therefore, standard identifier formats should be used whenever an RFID system will be used across multiple organizations.",

When the database is distributed across several organizations and many servers, a standard identifier format with specified fields greatly facilitates the lookup process. Therefore, standard identifier formats should be used whenever an RFID system will be used across multiple organizations.\n\nIf an organization does not expect its tag identifiers to be read by external parties or is concerned that the association of a tag with the organization or specific classes of objects is a business or privacy risk, then it may choose to develop and implement its own identifier format that does not reveal this information. Options include random or serialized identifiers that do not reveal information about the tagged item (e.g., its object class). Such identifiers can be encoded on many standards-based tags. These tags reserve memory for standard identifier formats but the memory does not have to be used for that purpose.\n\nThe data format chosen for an RFID system should be adequate for the entire life cycle of the system. Certain data formats may not have enough bits to uniquely encode all the tags that will be used in a particular application. For example, a supply chain RFID system may need longer identifiers to identify the large number of items that it will manage. The identifier data format also has security implications. For example, standard formats such as EPC allow an adversary to quickly obtain intelligence about a business activity by decoding the manager and object class fields.\n\n## 2.3.1.2 Power Source\n\nTags need power to perform functions such as sending radio signals to a reader, storing and retrieving data, and performing other computations (e.g., those needed for security mechanisms). Tags can obtain this power from a battery or from electromagnetic waves emitted by readers that induce an electric current in the tags. The power requirements of a tag depend on several factors, including the operating distance.# RFID Tag Types and Operating Frequencies",

The power requirements of a tag depend on several factors, including the operating distance.# RFID Tag Types and Operating Frequencies\n\n## Tag Types\n\nBetween the tag and the reader, the radio frequency being used, and the functionality of the tag. In general, the more complex the functions the tag supports, the greater its power requirements. For example, tags that support cryptography or authentication require more energy than tags that are limited to transmitting an identifier.\n\nTags are categorized into four types based on the power source for communication and other functionality:\n\n- Passive\n- Active\n- Semi-active\n- Semi-passive\n\n### Passive Tags\n\nA passive tag uses the electromagnetic energy it receives from a reader's transmission to reply to the reader. The reply signal from a passive tag, which is also known as the backscattered signal, has only a fraction of the power of the reader's signal. This limited power significantly restricts the operating range of the tag. It also means that passive tags can only support data processing of limited complexity. On the other hand, passive tags typically are cheaper, smaller, and lighter than other types of tags, which are compelling advantages for many RFID applications.\n\n### Active Tags\n\nAn active tag relies on an internal battery for power. The battery is used to communicate to the reader, to power on-board circuitry, and to perform other functions. Active tags can communicate over greater distance than other types of tags, but they have a finite battery life and are generally larger and more expensive. Since these tags have an internal power supply, they can respond to lower power signals than passive tags.",

The tag can then use its battery to communicate with the reader. Like active tags, semi-active tags can communicate over a longer distance than passive tags. Their main advantage relative to active tags is that they have a longer battery life. The waking process, however, sometimes causes an unacceptable time delay when tags pass readers very quickly or when many tags need to be read within a very short period of time.\n\n### Semi-passive Tags\n\nA semi-passive tag is a passive tag that uses a battery to power on-board circuitry, but not to produce return signals. When the battery is used to power a sensor, they are often called sensor tags. They typically are smaller and cheaper than active tags, but have greater functionality than passive tags because more power is available for other purposes.

  "### Semi-passive Tags\n\nA semi-passive tag is a passive tag that uses a battery to power on-board circuitry, but not to produce return signals. When the battery is used to power a sensor, they are often called sensor tags. They typically are smaller and cheaper than active tags, but have greater functionality than passive tags because more power is available for other purposes. Some literature uses the terms \"semi-passive\" and \"semi-active\" interchangeably.\n\n## Operating Frequencies\n\nThe radio frequencies at which a tag transmits and receives signals have implications for:\n\n- Tag performance characteristics, including operating range, speed of tag reads, and RFID data transfer rate. In general, as a tag's operating frequency increases, its signals are able to carry more data. As a result, higher frequency readers are also able to read more tags in a given period of time. In addition, RFID systems that operate at ultra high frequency (UHF) and microwave frequencies are...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nTypically designed to have a longer operating range than LF and high frequency (HF) systems. For most applications, the increased speed and operating range are considered advantages. One exception is applications for which security or privacy is a significant concern, such as those that involve financial transactions or personal data. In these cases, the ability of an adversary to read the data more quickly and from a longer distance typically is considered a risk that requires mitigation.\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n- **The ability of the tag's signal to penetrate materials.** As a general rule, higher frequencies are less able to penetrate substances such as metals or liquids than lower frequencies. Depending on the application, the penetration capabilities of a particular frequency can be either a benefit or a shortcoming. For example, LF communication typically is a requirement when tags are placed inside an animal (or humans, in some emerging medical applications) because RF attenuation in living tissue, which is mostly water, increases significantly as frequency increases. In applications in which security is a significant concern, an organization may want to use a frequency range that can be blocked by a particular material because this enables effective security shielding that might not otherwise be available. Table 2-1 summarizes the ability of RF signals to penetrate various substances.",

In applications in which security is a significant concern, an organization may want to use a frequency range that can be blocked by a particular material because this enables effective security shielding that might not otherwise be available. Table 2-1 summarizes the ability of RF signals to penetrate various substances.\n\n- **The likelihood of radio interference.** Radio interference is another reason why transmitted signals may not be properly received. Determining the potential sources of radio interference for a particular RFID implementation requires a site survey. RFID systems may experience radio interference from other systems that operate in the same or nearby frequency band. Interference often is exacerbated when using high power readers or when many readers are collocated. Table 2-2 lists potential sources of interference for RFID systems.\n\n- **The international portability of tags.** The types of systems that use various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum can differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction because not all regulators assign the same frequencies for the same purposes. If an RFID application requires transporting tags across multiple regulatory jurisdictions, then the system needs to use a frequency range permitted in all of the jurisdictions. Regulations impacting RFID often change, so organizations that use or plan to use RFID technology internationally should monitor relevant developments. Currently, there are frequencies within the LF, HF, and UHF bands that are permitted in most jurisdictions. Also, some tags are frequency-agile, so they can respond to one frequency in one jurisdiction and another in a different jurisdiction.\n\n### 2.3.1.4 Functionality\n\nThe primary function of a tag is to provide an identifier to a reader, but many types of tags support additional capabilities that are valuable for certain business processes. These include:\n\n- **Memory.** Memory that is nonvolatile enables data to be stored on tags and retrieved at a later time.# Memory Types in RFID Systems",

These include:\n\n- **Memory.** Memory that is nonvolatile enables data to be stored on tags and retrieved at a later time.# Memory Types in RFID Systems\n\nThis memory is either write once, read many (WORM) memory or re-writeable memory, which can be modified after initialization. Non-volatile memory enables more flexibility in the design of RFID systems because RFID data transactions can occur without concurrent access to data stored in an enterprise subsystem. However, adding memory to a tag increases its cost and power requirements.\n\n## RFID Application Requirements\n\nSection 3 discusses RFID application requirements and provides additional information about the circumstances under which the use of re-writable memory would be a desirable approach. In general, when this document refers to memory, it is referring to non-volatile memory. In contrast, volatile memory, which is also used in tags, supports tag computations and does not retain data after it is powered down.\n\n### Environmental Sensors\n\n- The integration of environmental sensors with tags is an example of the benefit of local memory. The sensors can record temperature, humidity, vibration, or other phenomena to the tag's memory, which can later be retrieved by a reader. The integration of sensors significantly increases the cost and complexity of the tags. Moreover, while many tag operations can be powered using the electromagnetic energy from a reader, this approach is not workable for sensors, which must rely on battery power. Tags integrated with sensors typically are only used with high-value, environmentally sensitive, or perishable objects worthy of the additional expense.\n\n### Security Functionality",

Tags integrated with sensors typically are only used with high-value, environmentally sensitive, or perishable objects worthy of the additional expense.\n\n### Security Functionality\n\n- Security functionality, such as password protection and cryptography. Tags with on-board memory are often coupled with security mechanisms to protect the data stored in that memory. For example, some tags support a lock command that, depending on its implementation, can prevent further modification of data in the tag's memory or can prevent access to data in the tag's memory. In some cases, the lock command is permanent and in other cases, a reader can \"unlock\" the memory. EPCglobal standards, standards developed jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and many proprietary tag designs support this feature. Some RFID systems support advanced cryptographic algorithms that enable authentication mechanisms and data confidentiality features, although these functions are most commonly found on RFID-based contactless smart cards and not tags used for item management. Some tags offer tamper protection as a physical security feature.\n\n### Privacy Protection Mechanisms\n\n- EPCglobal tags support a feature called the kill command that permanently disables the tag from responding to subsequent commands. The primary objective of the kill command is to protect personal privacy. Unlike the lock command, the kill command is irreversible. The kill command also prevents wireless access to a tag's identifier, in addition to any memory that may be on the tag. While the lock command provides security, the primary objective of the kill command is personal privacy. RFID tags could potentially be used to track individuals that.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## carry tagged items or wear tagged articles of clothing when the tags are no longer required for their intended use, such as to expedite checkout or inventory.\n\nThe ability to disable a tag with the kill command provides a mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to and illegitimate use of product information stored in the tag.\n\n### 2.3.1.5 Form Factor",

To a large extent, a tag's form factor is determined by the characteristics previously discussed, such as power source and functionality. Some important aspects regarding a tag's form factor include the size of the tag, the weight of the tag, and the method by which the tag is affixed to and removed from its associated object. Tags typically vary in size from smaller than a postage stamp to about the size of a common document stapler. Active tags typically are significantly larger and heavier than passive tags because they have an onboard power supply. Tags that integrate environmental sensors are also larger and heavier than those without this functionality. While increasing the computing functionality of a tag increases its cost and power requirements, it may not have an impact on its form factor because the microchip on a passive tag is one of the tag's smallest components. On most passive tags, the largest component on the tag is its antenna. Tags can be attached to items using an adhesive or can be embedded within the item. The primary concern when a tag is attached to an item is how easily it might be detached, whether accidentally or maliciously. Tags attached to items also are more vulnerable to harsh environmental conditions such as dust, debris, humidity, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. However, the vulnerability is intentional in some cases. For example, RFID tags known as frangible tags allow users to deactivate tags by tearing the tag's antenna from its circuitry. Organizations can create frangible tags on-site using a printer similar to the one shown in Figure 2-2. Tags that are embedded in objects (e.g., smart cards, animal tissue, plastic housing) are less vulnerable to tampering and environmental conditions.\n\n### 2.3.2 Reader Characteristics",
  "### 2.3.2 Reader Characteristics\n\nThe tag and the reader must comply with the same standard in order to communicate. If a tag is based on a proprietary design, a reader must support the same communication protocol to communicate with that tag. In many cases, if proprietary tags are used, only proprietary RFID readers from the same vendor can be used. Reader characteristics that are independent of tag characteristics include:\n\n- Power output and duty cycle,\n- Enterprise subsystem interface,\n- Mobility, and\n- Antenna design and placement.\n\nThese reader characteristics are discussed in Sections 2.3.2.1 through 2.3.2.4.\n\n#### 2.3.2.1 Power Output and Duty Cycle\n\nIn most cases, standards and regulations will determine the permitted power output and duty cycle of the readers. A reader's duty cycle is the percentage of time that the device is emitting energy over a specified period. For example, a reader that communicates for 30 seconds every minute has a 50% duty cycle.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Readers and Tags\n\nReaders that communicate with passive tags need greater power output than those that communicate with active tags because the signal must be strong enough to reach the tag and enable the backscatter to return to the reader. In general, readers with greater power output and duty cycles can read tags more accurately, more quickly, and from longer distances, but the greater power output also increases the risk of eavesdropping.\n\n## 2.3.2.2 Enterprise Subsystem Interface\n\nAll readers have an RF subsystem interface to communicate with tags. Most also have a second interface to communicate with the enterprise subsystem. The enterprise subsystem interface supports transfer of RFID data from the reader to enterprise subsystem's computers for processing and analysis. In most cases, the enterprise subsystem interface is used for remote management of the readers. The interface may be a wired (e.g., Ethernet) or wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi or satellite) link. Many systems use Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to monitor the readers and alert administrators of conditions that warrant attention.\n\n## 2.3.2.3 Mobility",

Many systems use Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to monitor the readers and alert administrators of conditions that warrant attention.\n\n## 2.3.2.3 Mobility\n\nA reader's interface with an enterprise subsystem may be wired or wireless. Most wired readers are in fixed locations and support applications in which the tags approach the reader. Some wired readers offer limited mobility using cables. Figure 2-3 shows a reader portal that reads tags on a pallet of boxes moving through the portal. Figure 2-4 shows reader antennas mounted above each toll lane in a series of toll booths. As vehicles pass through one of the toll lanes, the reader reads a transponder that is attached to that vehicle's windshield.\n\nIn contrast, wireless readers support applications in which personnel must move around to read tags. Figure 2-5 shows an example of a mobile handheld reader. A mobile reader usually uses different communications protocols on its RF and enterprise subsystem interfaces, even though both interfaces are wireless. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11, also known as Wi-Fi, is a common protocol for the enterprise subsystem interface, although it is also used for the RF interface on some active tag implementations. The most common RF interface protocols are defined in ISO/IEC standards, which include ISO/IEC 14443, ISO/IEC 15693, and the ISO/IEC 18000-series.\n\n## 2.3.2.4 Antenna Design and Placement\n\nReaders use a wide variety of antenna types. Each type has a different coverage pattern. To reduce the likelihood of eavesdropping and minimize interference with other radios, the coverage should only encompass a range sufficient to communicate with the intended tags. Antennas may be integrated into the device or may be detachable. Readers that support detachable antennas are better suited for applications that require specific coverage areas because an antenna can be selected or customized to meet those requirements.",

Figures 2-3 and 2-4 in Section 2.3.2.3 show examples of item tracking and automatic toll payment applications. Antennas can# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nalso be mounted on forklifts to identify items when they are moved from one location to another. In industrial applications, antennas are often placed in tunnels around a production line's conveyor belt.\n\n## 2.3.3 Tag-Reader Communication\n\nTag-reader communication is achieved by using a common communications protocol between the tag and the reader. Tag-reader communication protocols are often specified in RFID standards. Prominent international standards include the ISO/IEC 18000 series for item management and the ISO/IEC 14443 and ISO/IEC 15693 standards for contactless smart cards. The most recent EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard is essentially equivalent to the ISO/IEC 18000-6C standard. A more detailed explanation of RFID standards can be found in Appendix A on RFID Standards and Security Mechanisms.\n\nTag-reader communication characteristics that affect performance and security include:\n\n- How tag-reader communication is initiated,\n- How a reader identifies particular tags, and\n- How far away a tag or reader's signal can be reliably detected or interpreted.\n\nThese are discussed in detail in Sections 2.3.3.1 through 2.3.3.3.\n\n### 2.3.3.1 Communication Initiation\n\nTags and readers can initiate RF transactions in two general ways:",
  "Tag-reader communication characteristics that affect performance and security include:\n\n- How tag-reader communication is initiated,\n- How a reader identifies particular tags, and\n- How far away a tag or reader's signal can be reliably detected or interpreted.\n\nThese are discussed in detail in Sections 2.3.3.1 through 2.3.3.3.\n\n### 2.3.3.1 Communication Initiation\n\nTags and readers can initiate RF transactions in two general ways:\n\n- **Reader Talks First (RTF)**. In an RTF transaction, the reader broadcasts a signal that is received by tags in the reader's vicinity. Those tags may then be commanded to respond to the reader and to continue transactions with the reader.\n- **Tag Talks First (TTF)**. In a TTF transaction, a tag communicates its presence to a reader when the tag is within the reader's RF field. If the tag is passive, then it transmits as soon as it gets power from the reader's signal to do so. If the tag is active, then it transmits periodically as long as its power supply lasts. This type of transaction might be used when it is necessary to identify objects that pass by a reader, such as objects on a conveyer belt.\n\nReaders and tags in an RFID system typically operate using only RTF or only TTF transactions, not both types. Active tag TTF operation may be easier for an adversary to detect or intercept, because active tags send beaconing signals even when they are not in the presence of a reader. The adversary could eavesdrop on this communication without risking detection because in TTF transactions the adversary never has to send a signal to ascertain the tag's presence.\n\n### 2.3.3.2 Singulation\n\nSingulation is the process by which a reader identifies a particular tag. This capability is critical whenever multiple tags are in close proximity. For instance, when a reader issues a command to modify a tag's memory, neighboring tags should not accidentally execute the same command. Similarly, when a reader sends a query to a tag, the reader should not receive a response from multiple tags.",

Similarly, when a reader sends a query to a tag, the reader should not receive a response from multiple tags.\n\nIn the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard, the singulation protocol requires the reader to broadcast commands to all tags within its operating range. By issuing additional commands, the reader may limit interrogation to tags with specific memory contents. Tags respond with a random number. Once the# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nReader acknowledges this number, verifying that no tag collision has occurred, the tag will transmit its unique ID to the reader. The reader may then request another random number that it uses to address the tag in subsequent communication. The random number has significantly fewer bits than the tag's identifier, which simplifies the processing of later transactions and prevents transmission of the unique identifier by the reader.\n\nSome RFID technologies do not support singulation. For example, ISO 11784/11785 animal tracking tags have no collision detection or avoidance mechanism because multiple tags are not usually read in close proximity for this type of application.\n\n## 2.3.3.3 Signal Propagation Distance",

The reader transmits a signal to a tag over the forward channel. The tag responds on the back channel, which is also called the reverse channel or backscatter channel. When RFID systems use passive tags, signals on the forward channel typically are much more powerful than those on the back channel.

This difference has important implications for RFID communications security, including both the vulnerability of RF subsystem traffic and the mechanisms used to protect it.

For example, ISO/IEC 14443 tags have a typical operating range that is usually between 7 and 15 centimeters. However, security researchers have used a portable, low-power device to demonstrate that the rogue scanning range of an ISO/IEC 14443 contactless smart card is at least 25 centimeters (cm). Researchers have also successfully eavesdropped on ISO/IEC 14443 communications from distances up to 15 meters using fixed antennas and receivers that were tuned to the frequency of interest.\n\nIf the potential adversary does not need a reply from a passive tag to achieve...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## its objective, then the\nadversary can be much farther away. For instance, for many tags, a reader does not need to receive a message from the tag before writing to the tag's memory. This attack is not possible for certain commands in EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 tags, because mandatory cover-coding requires the reader to receive a key from the tag before issuing a command. Cover-coding is a technique used to obscure the content of messages from readers to tags and is described in more detail in Section 5.3.2.1.",

The presence of a signal indicates that RFID activity is occurring, which an adversary could use to infer that a shipment has arrived. An adversary may also be able to determine the number of transactions taking place even if that adversary cannot identify the nature of those transactions, but this nonetheless could be used to infer the level of business activity. This type of intelligence gathering is called traffic analysis, and it can be performed over much greater distances than eavesdropping.\n\n## 2.4 Enterprise Subsystem\nThe enterprise subsystem connects readers to computers running software that can store, process, and analyze data acquired from RF subsystem transactions to make the data useful to a supported business process. For example, an RFID system in a retail clothing store has an RF subsystem that can read the identifier associated with each tagged garment. The enterprise subsystem matches the identifier to the garment's record in a database to determine its price and the number of other items of a similar type that remain in inventory. Some simple RFID systems consist of an RF subsystem only (e.g., RFID-base systems in which a reader can make an access control decision without access to other computers). However, most RFID systems have both an RF subsystem and an enterprise subsystem.\n\nThe enterprise subsystem consists of three major components, which are shown in Figure 2-6, and described in Sections 2.4.1 through 2.4.3:\n- Middleware,\n- Analytic systems, and\n- Network infrastructure.",

Middleware hides the complexity and implementation details of the RF subsystem from the analytic systems. This allows the developers and users of the analytic systems to focus on the business implications of RFID data rather than the intricacies of wireless communication. For example, middleware filters duplicate, incomplete, and erroneous information it receives from readers. Middleware filtering is especially useful for applications in which large numbers of tags are in close proximity and for challenging RF environments, such as those containing reflective materials. The middleware can immediately transfer the filtered data to the analytic.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Systems or Aggregate and Store It for Later Retrieval\n\nSystem administrators also use middleware to monitor and manage readers. For example, system administrators use middleware to adjust the power output and duty cycle to reduce the number of transaction errors. Many middleware products also support event-based triggers that perform actions automatically under certain conditions. Middleware transaction logs help with the identification of anomalous behavior, which could help an organization detect unauthorized use of the RFID system. Many middleware products also provide additional features, such as support for printing RFID labels that provide benefits beyond data and device management.\n\n### 2.4.2 Analytic Systems\n\nAnalytic systems are composed of databases, data processing applications, and Web servers that process the data outputs of middleware based on business requirements and user instructions. They contain customized business logic for each business process they support.

For example, some RFID systems are designed to co-exist with or complement existing AIDC systems (e.g., bar code technology). Analytic systems also correlate RFID data with non-RFID business records imported from other databases, such as records from business partners, customers, logistics service providers, and suppliers. Therefore, analytic systems are often based on commercial database software or legacy applications that support processing of data other than RFID data. Analytic systems that are a part of the EPCglobal Network and process data based on tags that comply with EPCglobal standards are called EPC Information Services (EPCIS).\n\n### 2.4.3 Network Infrastructure\n\nNetwork infrastructure enables communication between the RF and enterprise subsystems, as well as among components of the enterprise subsystem.

Physical topology describes the network's cable plant or air interfaces. Logical topology describes how the communications links between devices are arranged. Network communications devices often are configured so that the logical topology is different than the physical topology. For example, communications equipment can be configured to create virtual private networks (VPN) that logically combine and segment physical networks to achieve performance and security objectives.\n\nThe physical topology of a network infrastructure supporting an RFID system depends on the physical location of the components in its enterprise subsystem. For example, the RF to# Enterprise Subsystem\n\nConnections are physically located near readers. The appropriate physical location of middleware servers depends on the level of traffic generated by the readers. If RFID transactions are relatively infrequent (e.g., an access control system with relatively small numbers of users), then the location of middleware is not critical. In this context, the middleware can be placed in a central location to serve multiple readers. If the business process requires large numbers of tags to be read quickly (e.g., multiple checkout stations in a busy store), then middleware is located near the readers to avoid latency problems and data throughput restrictions associated with many wide area networks. In some cases, middleware capabilities are incorporated into the communication switches to which the readers connect, so RFID-related traffic does not need to traverse even a single device before it is filtered and processed. This configuration is often termed an edge processing network because the switches are considered at the network's edges.",

In some cases, middleware capabilities are incorporated into the communication switches to which the readers connect, so RFID-related traffic does not need to traverse even a single device before it is filtered and processed. This configuration is often termed an edge processing network because the switches are considered at the network's edges.\n\nThe physical location of analytic systems usually depends on how an organization manages its enterprise applications. If the analytic systems are dedicated to the RFID application, then organizations often place these systems near readers and middleware. On the other hand, some organizations locate their analytic systems in remote data centers to take advantage of the centers' physical security, on-site technical personnel, and business continuity infrastructure (e.g., electric generators, enterprise data backup, high-availability communications equipment). If the analytic systems integrate both RFID and non-RFID information systems, then it is unlikely that the location of the RF subsystem will significantly influence the location of the analytic systems.\n\nWhen the enterprise subsystem components are distributed across an organization's network, the resulting physical topology can be complex, but depending on the network's configuration, the logical topology might be relatively simple. Many organizations create virtual local area networks (VLAN) for the distributed enterprise subsystem devices that make them appear to each other as if they were on the same network segment. VLANs reduce latency that causes performance problems on networks with large numbers of time-sensitive transactions. They also isolate traffic from other systems, which improves security.\n\n## 2.4.3.2 Data Communications Protocols",

VLANs reduce latency that causes performance problems on networks with large numbers of time-sensitive transactions. They also isolate traffic from other systems, which improves security.\n\n## 2.4.3.2 Data Communications Protocols\n\nData communications protocols are a critical component of a network's performance, reliability, and security. A complete discussion of data communications protocols is beyond the scope of this guide, but readers should be able to distinguish between link-layer and network-layer protocols to understand how RFID enterprise subsystem network infrastructures work and are secured. Link-layer protocols specify how devices communicate with each other over a common medium, or link. Network-layer protocols (sometimes called internetwork protocols) describe how data traffic is routed across multiple network links, possibly over many types of media.\n\nThe most common link-layer protocol connecting RFID enterprise subsystem components is Ethernet.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n(IEEE 802.3), which is the same link-layer protocol used to connect most office computers to local wired networks. Ethernet has no built-in security functionality, which means other complementary data communications protocols must provide any required protection.\n\nIn most RFID implementations, data communication within the enterprise subsystem is wired communication. The exception is mobile readers, which connect to the enterprise subsystem using a wireless link-layer protocol, such as Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11). Wi-Fi's characteristics are significantly different than the link-layer protocols supporting communication between tags and readers. In particular, Wi-Fi equipment supporting Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) includes numerous security features, such as strong authentication and encryption.\n\nThe most common network-layer protocol for enterprise subsystem communication is the IP. Since most modern computers are IP-enabled, enterprise subsystem components, such as middleware and analytic systems, can easily communicate across the enterprise and over external networks, including the Internet. The ability to communicate with a diverse range of computers and their application services also represents a security risk. IP-enabled enterprise subsystem components are subject to the same protocol attacks as any other IP-enabled computer.\n\n## 2.5 Inter-Enterprise Subsystem",

The ability to communicate with a diverse range of computers and their application services also represents a security risk. IP-enabled enterprise subsystem components are subject to the same protocol attacks as any other IP-enabled computer.\n\n## 2.5 Inter-Enterprise Subsystem\n\nThe inter-enterprise subsystem connects enterprise subsystems together when information needs to be shared across geographic or organizational boundaries, such as in a supply chain application. Not all RFID systems contain inter-enterprise subsystems. The largest government inter-enterprise subsystem is currently the US Department of Defense's (DoD) Global Transportation Network. The DoD improves its logistics and operational efficiency by tracking DoD assets and personnel from their origin to their destination.\n\nWhile many potential methods for building inter-enterprise subsystems exist, EPCglobal's inter-enterprise approach is a standards-based architecture that has broad industry support and publicly available documentation for review. This section focuses on EPCglobal's approach to the inter-enterprise subsystem for illustrative purposes, but the basic functional requirements described in the discussion of the EPCglobal standards would also apply to any alternative inter-enterprise subsystem architecture.\n\n### 2.5.1 Open System Networks\n\nRFID systems with inter-enterprise subsystems are called open or online systems because multiple entities have the ability to access tag-related information. In contrast, RFID systems that operate entirely within an enterprise, and thus have no inter-enterprise subsystem, are called closed or offline systems. EPCglobal is developing standards for an open infrastructure that will share data associated with EPCs over the Internet among participating organizations that agree to share such data.",

Both dedicated networks and VPNs are sometimes called extranets, to denote that information is shared outside the enterprise, as opposed to intranets, which are restricted to internal users. To enable extranet access, the implementing organization likely modifies its network firewall to permit RFID-related traffic to traverse the enterprise network boundary and also creates access privileges for external users on the analytic systems themselves. Companies typically sign agreements or memoranda of understanding that describe the roles and responsibilities associated with the access before enabling it.\n\nFigure 2-7 shows how various EPCIS might be connected in an open system network.\n\n## 2.5.2 Object Naming Service (ONS)",

To solve this problem, EPCglobal created the Object Naming Service (ONS), which is a global distributed database of EPC tag identifiers. Users query the ONS with a particular EPC, and the ONS returns the address information from the EPCIS that contains information associated with that EPC. The user then queries the EPCIS directly to obtain the desired data. The ONS is a resolution mechanism that directs an EPC query to where information associated with that EPC can be found on the network. In order to do that, the ONS utilizes two tiers of resolution services coordinated with the segments on the EPC string: the Root ONS and the Local ONS.\n\n- The Root ONS is a community service administered by EPCglobal that provides an authoritative lookup service indexing all EPC Managers with the addresses of their Local ONS.\n- The Local ONS is a software component maintained and operated locally by EPCglobal Network members. The Local ONS provides the authoritative database in which all EPCs issued by a specific EPC Manager are indexed with the addresses of their EPCIS location.",
  "- The Root ONS is a community service administered by EPCglobal that provides an authoritative lookup service indexing all EPC Managers with the addresses of their Local ONS.\n- The Local ONS is a software component maintained and operated locally by EPCglobal Network members. The Local ONS provides the authoritative database in which all EPCs issued by a specific EPC Manager are indexed with the addresses of their EPCIS location.\n\nWhen a member of the EPCglobal Network queries the network for information about an EPC, the Root ONS utilizes the EPC Manager Number segment to direct the EPC query to the EPC's data owner (i.e. the EPC Manager). From there, the EPC Manager's Local ONS utilizes the object class segment to direct the query to the EPCIS that stores information for that EPC.\n\nThe ONS extends the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) to support resolution of an EPC with its corresponding EPCIS. ONS EPC resolution works similarly to the name resolution that Internet users employ whenever visiting Web sites or sending e-mail messages, but with some significant differences, which are presented in Table 2-3.\n\nMuch like the DNS, the Root ONS is accessible by any Internet user. Some organizations may choose to implement their own Local ONS that is not connected to the EPCglobal Root ONS. Using an independent ONS limits the applications and users that can access it. This characteristic is a beneficial feature for organizations that require their EPCs to remain confidential, but is overly restrictive for organizations that expect large numbers of external users or that cannot anticipate a priori who will have access.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## a legitimate need for the EPC records\n(e.g., individual retail consumers seeking support after purchase of a tagged object).",

The concept of the EPCglobal Discovery Services is similar to ONS in that it is envisioned to return network addresses where data related to an EPC can be found. However, the Root ONS only provides information regarding where a particular tag was commissioned. It does not provide information regarding the history of a particular tag's transactions. Multiple entities along the supply chain would benefit from having quick access to this information that ONS does not offer. Discovery services offer a potential mechanism to make this information available over an inter-enterprise subsystem.",

For instance, it is envisioned that the EPCglobal Discovery Services will ultimately return multiple pointers from the multiple organizations that have collected information about the tagged object at some point in the object's life cycle. In addition, the EPCglobal Discovery Services may provide a cache for selected EPCIS data and may enforce authorization policies with respect to access of the aforementioned data. It is envisioned that more than one EPCglobal Discovery Service may operate in parallel, and may compete against each other and/or cater to particular audiences with specific information requirements.\n\n### 2.6 Summary\nRFID is an innovation in AIDC technology that provides significant advantages over earlier technology, such as optical scanning of bar codes.

The components of an RFID system can be categorized into three subsystems:\n- The RF subsystem,\n- The enterprise subsystem, and\n- The inter-enterprise subsystem.\n\nEvery RFID system includes an RF subsystem, which is composed of (1) tags attached to or embedded in objects and (2) readers that query the tags. Important characteristics of tags include their identifier format, the source of their power, the radio frequencies over which they operate, their size and shape, and additional functionality they support, such as security features and connections to environmental sensors. Important characteristics of readers include their power output, duty cycle, antenna design, and interface to the enterprise subsystem, which can be either wireless or wired. A wireless enterprise interface enables the reader to be mobile. Important aspects of tag-reader communication include the singulation protocol, the encoding scheme, and the distance over which tag and reader signals can be reliably received. In many RFID systems, the tags and readers are supported by an enterprise system.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nthat is composed of middleware, analytic systems, and networking services.

Analytic systems process and store this information to support business processes. Lastly, the networking services are used to provide the connections among the components of enterprise subsystem and between the enterprise subsystem and the RF subsystem.\n\nRFID systems that share information across organizational boundaries, such as supply chain applications, also have an inter-enterprise subsystem. The RF, enterprise, and inter-enterprise subsystems together allow an RFID system to support business processes. The versatile components of these subsystems allow an RFID system to be tailored to the needs of a particular application. If an inter-enterprise subsystem is constructed to EPCglobal specifications, then it will have a local ONS and an EPCIS, and may utilize the EPCglobal Root ONS and Discovery Services. The Root ONS provides an authoritative lookup for an EPC identifier that returns pointers to the resources from the organization that created that identifier. Finally, EPCglobal Discovery Services are envisioned to serve as a type of search engine for an EPC identifier that can return pointers to multiple organizations that have information related to that EPC identifier (e.g., companies in the supply chain that have completed a transaction with a particular tag and registered information related to its EPC in their EPCIS).\n\n## 3. RFID Applications and Application Requirements\n\nRFID technologies are being deployed by many organizations because they have the potential to improve mission performance and reduce operational costs. To achieve these goals, RFID systems must be engineered to support the specific business processes that the organization is automating. Applications for RFID technologies are diverse because of the wide range of business processes that exist. RFID security risks and the controls available to mitigate them are also highly varied. Typically, only a subset of the full range of technologies, risks, and controls is applicable to any given RFID implementation. Important business drivers that shape RFID application requirements and the resulting characteristics of RFID systems include:\n\n- The general functional objective of the RFID technology (i.e., the application type),\n- The nature of the information that the RFID system processes or generates,\n- The physical and technical environment at the time RFID transactions occur,\n- The physical and technical environment before and after RFID transactions take place, and\n- The economics of the business process and RFID system.\n\nThis section discusses each of these characteristics in greater detail and provides an overview of common types of RFID applications.",

The key characteristic differentiating one RFID application from another is the purpose of identifying the tagged items. Table 3-1 lists reasons why an organization might want to identify an item and the general application.# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n## Type that best corresponds to those reasons.\n\nApplication types are not mutually exclusive; an implementation can combine elements of several application types. For example, both access control systems and sophisticated asset management systems include tracking features. Supply chain management is a tracking application that spans organizational boundaries and often includes process control and payment transactions. Personnel responsible for designing and implementing RFID systems should understand what application types apply to their implementation so that they can select appropriate security controls. For example, the security controls needed to protect financial transactions in automated payment systems are different than those needed for tracking applications. The personnel should also understand that an adversary may leverage RFID technology for an unintended purpose. For example, a warehouse may use RFID technology to determine what items it has in its current inventory, but an adversary may use the same system to track an item's whereabouts after it leaves the warehouse. In this case, an asset management system is later used to enable an unauthorized tracking application, perhaps used by an adversary to locate high value targets.\n\nThe remainder of Section 3.1 examines each of the application types mentioned in Table 3-1, as well as supply chain management. The section uses hypothetical examples to illustrate the key characteristics of each application type and highlights how they differ from one another. The section also incorporates other examples of each application to provide additional information on current and potential applications of the technology.\n\n### 3.1.1 Asset Management",
  "The remainder of Section 3.1 examines each of the application types mentioned in Table 3-1, as well as supply chain management. The section uses hypothetical examples to illustrate the key characteristics of each application type and highlights how they differ from one another. The section also incorporates other examples of each application to provide additional information on current and potential applications of the technology.\n\n### 3.1.1 Asset Management\n\nRFID-based asset management systems are used to manage inventory of any item that can be tagged. Asset management systems using RFID technology offer significant advantages over paper-based or bar code systems, including the ability to read the identifiers of multiple items nearly simultaneously without optical line of sight or physical contact. These features increase the speed of common asset management tasks, which improves operational efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nPerhaps the simplest form of asset management is Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS), which accounts for items in retail stores. For example, EAS tags are placed on electronic equipment, clothing, books, and many other consumer goods at major retailers. After a customer purchases an item, the sales clerk deactivates the tag. If a person attempts to leave the shop with unpurchased goods, readers at the doors will detect the activated tag and trigger an alarm. In this case, the RFID technology determines only one thing: whether or not the EAS tag is still operating, indicating that the item has not been properly checked out.\n\nMost RFID-based asset management systems provide additional functionality. For example, at a doctor's office, the medical records clerk can quickly scan the filing system on a monthly or quarterly basis to determine how many medical records are present or missing. The records clerk can also instantly...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Compare the List of Missing Records\n\nCompare the list of missing records with a list of those known to be checked out of the filing system. Without RFID technology, this task could take hours or days to complete by hand. Bar code technology, such as that found at a supermarket, would require physical handling of each medical record, which is labor-intensive.\n\nRFID is also an enabling technology for smart shelves and smart cabinets, which automatically maintain continuous inventories of the items they hold by tracking items entering and leaving. Items are reordered automatically when inventory is low. The smart shelves and cabinets can also be used for theft prevention, alerting personnel when many high-value items are taken at the same time, and perhaps activating a camera to record the event.",

The smart shelves and cabinets can also be used for theft prevention, alerting personnel when many high-value items are taken at the same time, and perhaps activating a camera to record the event.\n\n### 3.1.2 Tracking\n\nTracking applications are used to identify the location of an item, or more accurately, the location of the last reader that detected the presence of the tag associated with the item. Many tracking applications are part of an asset management system. One difference between relatively simple asset management systems and tracking systems is that an asset management system can detect the presence of an item with readers at a single location. In contrast, tracking systems require more than one reader, as well as a network, so that a central system can aggregate and correlate information received from each of the readers.\n\nAt transportation hubs (such as ports or train stations), readers are placed throughout the facility. The security staff can track the location of its employees wearing RFID-equipped identification badges as they pass through doors or gates. In addition to restricting access to specific areas of the facility, these RFID-enabled identification badges help the security department locate specific staff members during emergency situations and to monitor building evacuations during fire alarms.\n\nTracking applications can also be used to measure sports performance. Some companies sell systems to track athletes during races. This application requires each racer to wear a unique tag that is registered with the tracking system. Such systems can be used for any mass start event, including bicycling, running, or triathlons. Different events may require the athletes to wear the tags in a certain way to be detected by the system. For example, runners may be required to put the tag in one of their shoes or cyclists may be required to mount the tag on their bicycles.\n\n### 3.1.3 Authenticity Verification",

For example, runners may be required to put the tag in one of their shoes or cyclists may be required to mount the tag on their bicycles.\n\n### 3.1.3 Authenticity Verification\n\nIn authenticity verification applications, the tag provides evidence of the source of a tagged item. Authenticity verification often is incorporated into a tracking application. The originating source of the tag creates a record of the initialization transaction, either on the tag or in an enterprise subsystem database. When readers subsequently query the tag, they can determine if it originated from a proper source. For authenticity verification systems to provide appropriate levels of assurance, they typically need to incorporate cryptography and mechanisms to prevent cloning. Digital signatures use cryptography to provide the property of non-repudiation, which means the signatory cannot later deny.# Creating the Signature\n\nAuthenticity verification applications can use digital signatures to establish evidence of authenticity and enable later verification. The pharmaceutical industry is using RFID for authenticity verification to reduce the prevalence of counterfeit drugs.\n\n## 3.1.4 Matching\n\nIn a matching application, two tagged items are matched with each other and a signal (e.g., a light or tone) is triggered if one of the items is later matched with an incorrect tagged item. The most common matching application today occurs in hospitals and involves placing bracelets with tags on mothers and their newborn babies. If a new mother is accidentally given another woman's infant, the system issues an alert. Similar technology allows day care centers to match children to parents or guardians, and hospital patients to their medicines and designated visitors. In the future, RFID tags might match airline passengers with their checked luggage to prevent theft and inadvertent mistakes.\n\n## 3.1.5 Process Control",

In the future, RFID tags might match airline passengers with their checked luggage to prevent theft and inadvertent mistakes.\n\n## 3.1.5 Process Control\n\nProcess control applications allow business processes to use information associated with a tag (or the item attached to the tag) to take a customized action. A common process control application is the facilitation of product design variations in manufacturing processes. For example, a tag might be affixed to the frame of a product on an assembly line in a manufacturing plant. The tag's identifier would be associated with desired features of the finished product. At each station in the assembly process, a reader would read the tag and take an appropriate action, such as adding a specialized component or using a particular color of paint. In another typical application, sensors are attached to tags to measure factors such as temperature, humidity, or shock. Information from the sensors can be used to make decisions regarding the tagged items. For example, a perishable product may be discarded if it has been exposed to room temperature for more than a threshold period of time.",

For example, a perishable product may be discarded if it has been exposed to room temperature for more than a threshold period of time.\n\nIn asset management, tracking, and matching applications, each reader only needed to capture the tag's identifier (a number permanently assigned to the tag) and apply a timestamp to the transaction. In process control applications, additional information beyond the tag's identifier is normally associated with each tag. That information could reside on the tag itself or in a networked database. In either case, the additional information introduces a level of complexity not found in the previously discussed applications. Implementing organizations have additional design issues to consider, such as exactly what information needs to be recorded, where it should be stored, how it should be protected, and their customers' expectation of privacy for that information.\n\n## 3.1.6 Access Control\n\nAccess control systems use RFID to automatically check if an individual is authorized to physically access a facility (e.g., a gated campus or a specific building) or logically access an information technology system. Some systems are implemented using contactless RFID smart cards instead of mechanical keys. Every individual that is given access to specific areas must carry one of these cards. Locked doors or turnstiles typically protect the areas. To unlock them, authorized personnel...# Access Control Systems",

The door or turnstile will unlock once the reader has authenticated the smart card. The system can be configured such that only certain cards can be used to unlock certain doors or turnstiles. The possession of the cards may also be combined with a password, personal identification number (PIN), or biometric (e.g., fingerprint or retina scan) for additional security.\n\n## Types of Access Control Systems\nThere are two general types of access control systems: online and offline.\n\n### Online Systems\nOnline systems have readers that are networked to a central computer. In an online system, each card is linked to a specific person. Each reader is supplied by the central computer with a list of individuals that can access the corresponding area. Since this system is networked, the central computer can provide updated access lists to the readers.\n\n### Offline Systems\nIn contrast, offline systems are not networked. In offline systems, the card lists the rooms that the holder can access, perhaps also listing an expiration date. When someone attempts to access a room using the card, the reader checks that the card contains one of the permitted identifiers before allowing entry.\n\n## RFID Technology in Automobile Keys\nRFID technology is also used in automobile key applications, which is effectively a type of access control. There are two basic types: immobilizers and push-button keyless start.\n\n### Immobilizers\nWith immobilizers, a tag is embedded into a key similar to a traditional vehicle key; the tag in the key is read by a reader in the dashboard or steering column. For the key to start the vehicle, it must both have the right shape for the ignition system and contain the tag. Duplication of these keys is significantly more difficult and costly than traditional keys, which has helped to reduce vehicle thefts.",

Instead, each driver simply carries a key fob into the vehicle. Once the key fob is detected, the vehicle is started by pushing a start button on the dashboard.\n\n## Automated Payment\n### RFID Technology in Financial Transactions\nRFID technology automates a variety of financial transactions, including fare collection on public transit systems, toll collection on roads, fuel charges at gas station pumps, and retail payment using credit cards with embedded RFID tags. The US General Services Administration (GSA) Smart Card Program provides RFID-based cards that support financial transactions. The main advantages over other payment forms are speed and convenience; RFID-based automated payment systems do not require users to physically exchange cash or cards with clerks or machines.\n\n### Security in Automated Payment Systems\nAutomated payment systems are a specialized form of access control in which access is granted to credit or debit a financial account. Like other access control systems, they require additional security protections to prevent fraud and abuse. In the case of automated payment, integrity and confidentiality controls are needed as well as protection against duplicating or modifying tags; users should not be able to alter debit and credit amounts, and bystanders should not be able to record account numbers or other transaction details. For these reasons, the protocols and cryptography that...# Support Automated Payment Systems",

For these reasons, the protocols and cryptography that...# Support Automated Payment Systems\n\nAutomated payment systems typically are considerably more complex than those that support physical access control systems.\n\nAutomated payment systems can be online or offline. Online systems, which are the most common, store and process the financial data in a central system networked with the readers. Offline systems require the smart card to store \"electronic cash\" and handle debit and credit transactions, which involve more sophisticated computing and increase the cost of each card. One advantage of offline systems is that they can support the same user anonymity achieved with cash, while centralized systems must link users to their accounts. However, because most users do not demand complete anonymity, the additional complexity and expense of offline systems make them relatively uncommon.\n\nOne example of an automated payment system is currently being used by large resorts and cruise ships. Guests are issued RFID-enabled identification cards upon check-in. These cards are linked to credit card accounts and enable passengers to pay for meals and gift shop items. They are also used for identification when guests disembark the ship or leave the resort grounds.\n\n## 3.1.8 Supply Chain Management\n\nSupply chain management involves the monitoring and control of products from manufacture to distribution to retail sale. Supply chain management typically bundles several application types, including asset management, tracking, process control, and payment systems. An important distinguishing feature of supply chain management systems is that they span multiple organizations, each of which uses RFID technology that interoperates with the others. When a system is not under one organization's control, it is referred to as an open system. The previously discussed systems are closed systems because a single organization manages them. Open systems are inherently more vulnerable than closed systems because the network, application and operational interfaces between organizations provide an adversary with more potential avenues to attack the system.",

Open systems are inherently more vulnerable than closed systems because the network, application and operational interfaces between organizations provide an adversary with more potential avenues to attack the system.\n\nSupply chain systems can record information about products at every stage in the supply chain. Ideally, tags are affixed to products during the manufacturing process or soon afterward. As a product moves through the supply chain, to the end customer, and later to post-sale service, the tag's identifier can be used by all supply chain participants to refer to a specific item. In addition, supply chain systems that use active tags can track larger objects such as cargo containers. Tags on these containers can store a manifest of the items shipped in each container. This manifest can be automatically updated when items are removed from the container.\n\nThe information collected by a supply chain RFID system offers many benefits. By more accurately tracking products throughout their life cycle, participants can realize improved speed and accuracy of ordering, automated invoicing and payment, fewer supply shortages with lower inventory levels, and reduced shrinkage (product loss or theft). Furthermore, RFID-based supply chain systems give management programs better visibility into the supply chain, which enables identification of bottlenecks.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Targeted Recalls and Market Research\nTargeted recalls, and new forms of market research. Such systems also generate an electronic pedigree for each item. This feature gives buyers evidence of the item's freshness, so they can identify if its useful life has expired. It also provides buyers evidence of a product's authenticity, so buyers can determine if it is an unauthorized clone.\n\n## 3.2 RFID Information Characteristics\nOnce an organization determines the general application type that corresponds to the business process it wants to enhance or enable with RFID technology, it should characterize the information that will be processed by the system.",

In EAS systems, the necessary information is conveyed in a single bit: either the tag is functioning (the item has not yet been sold), or it has been deactivated (the product has been sold). For this reason, EAS is referred to as a one-bit or single-bit application.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of relatively simple asset management systems, the only data required is the identifier on the tag. The RFID system merely records which items are present or have been read by the reader. Matching applications also have relatively simple data requirements because they just link one identifier with another.\n\nData storage requirements increase in tracking applications. The system needs to record which of multiple readers last read the tag and at what time. As the tracking systems get more complex, more data is collected, such as changes in the possession of the item (e.g., someone signing for a package) or the particular contents of a container. Process control applications further increase data requirements because they use the recorded specifications of an item to customize actions in the business process.\n\nSupply chain management systems are the most data-intensive RFID application. They not only process data, but they must also maintain information about the data, such as the formats the various organizations in the supply chain use to store and transmit data and the network addresses of database servers that contain data about tagged items.\n\n## Questions Regarding RFID Data Elements\nWhen determining the appropriate RFID technology and security controls for a given RFID application, the personnel responsible should ask three questions regarding each data element in the RFID system:\n- Is it considered sensitive or confidential?\n- Could the data element be easily correlated or combined with other data to allow someone to infer sensitive or confidential information through indirect means?\n- Does it change, and if so, how frequently?",

Organizations need to examine and invest in security controls to protect RFID data depending on the sensitivity level of that data. They also need to consider how data elements might be combined with other data to make inferences or build profiles, particularly if data elements are shared across organizations or stored for long periods of time.\n\nAnother important characteristic of the data is whether it changes over time. In general, tag identifiers never change, but the data associated with the identifier can change. For example, in asset management applications, the RFID system may maintain information about product features.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nsuch as make, model, size, color, and serial number. These product features typically will be written once and then will not change while the item remains in the system. However, if the asset management application's primary focus is tracking containers rather than specific items, then the data changes frequently as the container is reused to store and transport new items. In access control applications, if a tag acts as a key for a particular item, such as an automobile, then nothing should change once the tag is linked with that item. If the access control application allows a security administrator to change someone's access to different areas and rooms based on changing business roles, then the system must store data related to the access rules.",

If the access control application allows a security administrator to change someone's access to different areas and rooms based on changing business roles, then the system must store data related to the access rules.\n\nIn general, the implementation specifics rather than the application type determine the extent to which data must be modified. When data elements change, the supporting technology must support write transactions and must have an access control mechanism to protect the integrity of the data. Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.3.1 provide information on authentication and access control methods. When an element does not change, it does not require this support. Organizations planning RFID implementations should analyze what data is required to support the business process and which elements must be modifiable. One important factor is whether tags and their identifiers will be used once and discarded, or reused. The results of this exercise will help organizations identify appropriate RFID technology and security mechanisms to meet their requirements.\n\n## 3.3 RFID Transaction Environment\n\nThe conditions under which readers query tags are a significant determinant of an RFID system's technology requirements. The most important parameters regarding the RFID transaction environment include:\n\n- The distance between the reader and the tag,\n- The amount of time in which a transaction must be completed, and\n- Whether or not the reader has access to a network and can use the network to store related data.\n\nSections 3.3.1 through 3.3.3 discuss these parameters.\n\n### 3.3.1 Distance between Reader and Tag\n\nDistance requirements often determine the type of tag that can be deployed. The distance between the reader and the tag also has security implications. In general, longer distances between the reader and the tag could make it easier for an adversary to eavesdrop on their communications. Longer distances also allow an adversary to use their own reader to perform unauthorized transactions more easily (as discussed in Section 2.3.3.3).",

In general, longer distances between the reader and the tag could make it easier for an adversary to eavesdrop on their communications. Longer distances also allow an adversary to use their own reader to perform unauthorized transactions more easily (as discussed in Section 2.3.3.3).\n\nIn some cases, the RFID system designer has considerable latitude in setting the distance between reader and tag. For example, an application controlling access to a garage might require drivers to place an RFID-enabled badge within inches of a reader or it might require a general proximity of several feet to a RFID-enabled transponder within the vehicle. The choice is essentially an application design decision that may include such factors as cost and convenience.\n\nIn other cases, the distance between reader and tag is dictated by the\n```# Environment in which the RFID system will be deployed\n\nFor example, a toll payment application that identifies vehicles on a highway may require that readers query tags from a distance of several meters. In this case, the minimum read distance is a requirement for the design of the RFID system.\n\n## 3.3.2 Transaction Speed\n\nTransaction speed can be measured in a variety of ways. A common metric is the number of tags read per second. The main reasons why an application has requirements related to the speed of transactions are:\n\n- Readers are expected to communicate with multiple tags nearly simultaneously and cannot do so if each transaction takes longer than a certain period of time.\n- Tagged items are in motion and only reside in a reader's operating range for a limited period of time.\n- The system's users may perceive the application as a nuisance if transactions take longer than a short period of time to complete.",

In this case, each transaction must be completed within a small fraction of a second or the process may take too long to finish. Similar issues may arise when trying to read the tags of athletes in a tracking system designed to measure race times. In this case, if the transactions take too long, there is a chance that some participants in the race may go out of range before the reader identifies them.\n\nMany security mechanisms introduce latency into RFID transactions. Additional steps are needed to perform authentication, encryption, cover-coding, and other security-related procedures. Each additional step takes time. When considering security controls, organizations need to balance the business impact of each security control's effect on transaction speed with the protection it provides.\n\n## 3.3.3 Network Connectivity and Data Storage\n\nWhether or not an RFID system's readers are networked with database applications has major implications for the architecture of the RFID system and its security. When an application needs to link data with tags, the data needs to be stored somewhere. If the readers are networked with databases, then the data can be stored in the databases.

When an application needs to link data with tags, the data needs to be stored somewhere. If the readers are networked with databases, then the data can be stored in the databases. Otherwise, the data must be stored on the tags.\n\nWhen data is stored centrally on database servers, the tag only needs to contain an identifier, which links the tag to its associated information. In this architecture, the vast majority of the data processing occurs on the supporting systems to which the reader is connected. On the other hand, when data is stored on tags, the tags must have some form of memory and support both write and read transactions.\n\nRegardless of where data is stored, the data's integrity must be protected. If the data is sensitive, its confidentiality must also be protected. The methods for achieving this include authentication, access control, encryption, and physical security. However, database servers and tags implement these methods in different ways. Nearly all commercial database servers support a wide variety of configurable security.```markdown\n# RFID Systems and Data Storage\n\nControls, but most tags do not.

However, a system may require local storage of data on tags for several reasons, including:\n\n- Extending the network to a remote RFID reader is not feasible or is more expensive than using tags that support the required functionality.\n- Accessing the data from the network introduces unacceptable latency.\n- Network availability is inherently poor, perhaps as a result of harsh operating conditions, which makes accessing data on tags a more reliable approach.\n- The participants in an open system have determined that the risk of storing data on tags is less than the risk of opening their networks to external entities.\n- Each tag must collect and store information from a sensor or other data source before it can communicate with a networked reader.\n- Users want control over when personal data is shared and therefore prefer that it remain on the tag and not in an enterprise database.\n\n## 3.4 The Tag Environment between Transactions\n\nRFID system requirements depend on what happens between transactions, as well as during transactions. Relevant factors before and after reader communication include:\n\n- Whether or not the business process requires that the tag collect data about its environment, and\n- The human, technical, and environmental threats that pose risks to the tag's integrity.\n\nThese factors are discussed in Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2.\n\n### 3.4.1 Data Collection Requirements\n\nIn some applications, each tag is attached to a sensor that stores data in memory that is accessible to the tag. The memory may belong to the sensor, to the tag, or to a combined device. In some cases, the application's core purpose is to capture this data, and RFID technology merely provides a vehicle to access it remotely. In other cases, the sensor data supports an asset management or tracking application, and the objective is to take measurements to ensure that storage or transport conditions are as expected.",

Selecting appropriate RFID technology and security controls depends on the level of the threat in the environments in which the tags are expected to reside. Some human threats to tags include the ability of an adversary to:\n\n- Damage or destroy a tag,\n- Remove the tag from the item to which it was attached,\n- Replace a tag with another one, or\n- Clone a tag and use the clone for an unintended purpose.\n\nFor example, in an EAS application, someone might remove or disable a tag to steal an item from a store without triggering an alarm. Alternatively, someone could replace a tag with one from a lower-priced item before purchasing the tagged item. In an access control application, someone might replace a tag with one that has greater access. If the replaced tag were attached to a picture identification badge, an adversary might be able to effectively gain the privileges of another person while appearing legitimate to personnel who visually check the badge.\n```# Environmental Threats to Tags",

If the replaced tag were attached to a picture identification badge, an adversary might be able to effectively gain the privileges of another person while appearing legitimate to personnel who visually check the badge.\n```# Environmental Threats to Tags\n\nEnvironmental threats to tags include extreme heat, cold, moisture, vibration, shock, and radiation (including sunlight). Any risk assessment of environmental threats should also consider the impact of these conditions to the material to which the tag is attached and the glue or other mechanism that attaches the tag to the item. Impacts of harsh environmental conditions include degradation of tag performance, destruction of the tag, and separation of the tag from its associated item. Organizations need to assess the likelihood of these threats in their environment and set requirements for their RFID technology accordingly. In general, human threats are more likely to be realized if outsiders (e.g., customers or members of the general public) have physical access to the tags and therefore the means to engage in malicious behavior. Human threats are also more likely if people have an incentive to perform the attack, such as some form of financial gain or access to a restricted resource.\n\n## 3.5 RFID Economics\n\nCost-benefit tests can be applied to any technology project, but the RF subsystem of an RFID system has differentiating characteristics, especially regarding security.

RFID Risks\n\nRFID technology enables an organization to significantly change its business processes to:\n\n- Increase its efficiency, which results in lower costs,\n- Increase its effectiveness, which improves mission performance and makes the implementing organization more resilient and better able to assign accountability, and\n- Respond to customer requirements to use RFID technology to support supply chains and other applications.\n\nThe RFID technology itself is complex, combining a number of different computing and communications technologies to achieve the desired objectives. Unfortunately, both change and complexity generate risk. For RFID implementations to be successful, organizations need to effectively manage that risk, which requires an understanding of its sources and its potential characteristics. This section reviews the major high-level business risks associated with RFID systems so that organizations planning or operating these systems can better identify,# Characterizing and Managing Risks in RFID Systems\n\nThe risks are as follows:\n\n## Business Process Risk\nDirect attacks on RFID system components potentially could undermine the business processes the RFID system was designed to enable.\n\n## Business Intelligence Risk\nAn adversary or competitor potentially could gain unauthorized access to RFID-generated information and use it to harm the interests of the organization implementing the RFID system.\n\n## Privacy Risk\nPersonal privacy rights or expectations may be compromised if an RFID system uses what is considered personally identifiable information for a purpose other than originally intended or understood.

The personal possession of functioning tags also is a privacy risk because it could enable tracking of those holding tagged items.\n\n## Externality Risk\nRFID technology potentially could represent a threat to non-RFID networked or collocated systems, assets, and people.\n\nAn important characteristic of RFID that impacts all of these risks is that RF communication is invisible to operators and users. In other AIDC and IT systems, it often is easier to identify when unauthorized behavior is occurring. This section characterizes the risks listed above in more detail. The security controls that mitigate these risks are discussed in Section 5.\n\n### 4.1 Business Process Risk\nRFID systems typically are implemented to replace or enhance a paper or partially automated process. Organizations implementing RFID systems could become reliant on those systems, which if not implemented properly with business continuity planning might be less resilient to disruptions than the systems they replace.\n\nFor example, suppose that a warehouse replaces its paper-based inventory management system with an RFID-enabled system. The paper system involves storing completed forms at the warehouse and sending form duplicates to a central office, while the new RFID system locates its backend database servers at a single computing center. In this environment, the paper system might be more resilient to a local disaster than the RFID system, despite the increased efficiency, accuracy, or effectiveness of the RFID-enabled business process.",

This risk is distinct\nfrom the business process risk because it can be realized even when business\nprocesses are functioning as\nintended.\n\nA competitor or adversary can gain information from the RFID system in a number\nof ways, including\neavesdropping on RF links between readers and tags, performing independent\nqueries on tags to obtain\nrelevant data, and obtaining unauthorized access to a back-end database storing\ninformation about tagged\nitems. Supply chain applications may be particularly vulnerable to this risk\nbecause a variety of external\nentities may have read access to the tags or related databases. The risk of\nunauthorized access is realized\nwhen the entity engaging in the unauthorized behavior does something harmful\nwith that information.\n\nIn some cases, the information may trigger an immediate response.

One concern is that organizations may collect personal information for a particular purpose, such as to complete a financial transaction or grant an individual access to a facility, and then later use that information for a different purpose that the individual finds undesirable, such as to conduct a direct marketing campaign. Another concern is that organizations that are implementing RFID systems to serve a particular business process might not be aware of how the RFID information could be used for unintended purposes, such as the targeting or tracking of individuals, or the potential disclosure of personal practices or preferences to unauthorized third parties.\n\nThere are privacy risks from the perspective of the individual and from the perspective of the organization implementing RFID technology. The privacy risk from the perspective of the individual is the unauthorized revelation of personal information and the personal consequences of that breach. The privacy risk from the perspective of the implementing organization might include:\n\n- Penalties if the organization does not comply with privacy laws and regulations,\n- Customer avoidance or boycott of the organization because of real or perceived privacy concerns about RFID technology,\n- Being held legally liable for any consequences of the weak privacy protections, and\n- Employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders might disassociate with the organization due to concerns about corporate social responsibility.",

Organizations can benefit from the analysis and sharing of personal information obtained with RFID technology. At the same time, these activities may potentially violate the privacy rights or expectations of citizens and consumers. Similarly, methods to protect personal privacy may pose a business process risk. For example, consumers may want tags to be disabled at point-of-sale so that they cannot be used for tracking purposes afterwards. However, if it is easy to disable a tag at point-of-sale, then it may also be easier for adversaries to disable tags prior to point-of-sale, thereby disrupting the business process. Moreover, organizations may want to use tags after point-of-sale for post-sale support, recalls, and other purposes.\n\nPrivacy risk may increase when an individual possesses tags from multiple organizations because someone reading the tags can now combine and correlate information to profile.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## individuals in ways that\nnone of the organizations alone might have anticipated.

Every connection\npoint between the RFID system and something outside the RFID system represents a\npotential\nvulnerability for the entity on the other side of the connection, whether that\nis an application process, a\nvalued asset, or a person. Externality risks are present for both the RF and\nenterprise subsystems of an\nRFID system. The main externality risk for the RF subsystem is hazards resulting\nfrom electromagnetic\nradiation, which could possibly range from adverse human health effects to\nignition of combustible\nmaterial, such as fuel or ordnance. The main externality risk for the enterprise\nsubsystem is successful\ncomputer network attacks on networked devices and applications. Computer network\nattacks can involve\nmalware (e.g., worms and viruses) or attack tools that exploit software\nvulnerabilities and configuration\nweaknesses to gain access to systems, perform a denial of service, or cause\nother damage. The impact of\ncomputer network attacks can range from performance degradation to complete\ncompromise of a mission-critical application.\n\nBecause the externality risk by definition involves risks outside of the RFID\nsystem, it is distinct from\nboth the business process and business intelligence risks; externality risks can\nbe realized without having\nany effect on RFID-supported business processes or without revealing any\ninformation to adversaries.",

The potential risk of electromagnetic radiation includes:\n\n- Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to people (HERP),\n- Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance (HERO),\n- Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to fuel (HERF), and\n- Hazards of electromagnetic radiation to other materials, including medical supplies such as blood products, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nAs of the publication of this document, no documented examples have been identified that any of these hazards have been realized with respect to RFID technology, which typically operates at power levels below those that would cause a concern. Moreover, no research has suggested the realization of these risks with respect to RFID technology is likely, although interaction with some medical devices has been the subject of research studies. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) promulgates regulations to protect citizens against unsafe radio transmissions by requiring equipment testing and certification. The FCC limits for general population/uncontrolled exposure are tabulated in Appendix E.\n\nIn addition, DoD regulations require HERO and HERF evaluation of RF systems. It is important to note that RFID systems may be within exposure limits when initially installed, but later exceed limit operators increase the emitted power of readers, perhaps to improve the performance and reliability of the system.\n\nNevertheless, the critical consequences that would result from any realization of the risk suggest that organizations exercise prudence when fielding RFID technology, especially in complex electromagnetic environments. Electromagnetic signals and waves can reflect, interfere, and resonate in unintended ways in complex electromagnetic environments that include metal objects such as metal doors, window frames, and metal enclosures. This can result in unexpected or unintended signal and field cancellation, interference, summation, or resonance. This makes it difficult to accurately predict specific localized field levels from radiated power alone. Some factors that may warrant additional examination of electromagnetic radiation hazards include:",

Some factors that may warrant additional examination of electromagnetic radiation hazards include:\n\n- The use of RFID equipment that has not been certified by the FCC or that has been modified to operate outside of FCC mandated limits (both of which are illegal in the US but may be legal in other countries), and\n- Operating RFID equipment in environments in which signal reflections and other electromagnetic effects can focus radiation in unintended ways.\n\n## 4.4.2 Computer Network Attacks\n\nRFID technology represents a new attack vector on an enterprise network. Once RFID systems are implemented, a possibility exists that attackers could reach non-RFID and enterprise subsystem computers through a reader, although no such attack is known to have successfully occurred to date. If the system involves wireless handheld readers, then the wireless link between the reader and the networked middleware servers is another point of entry. Once RFID servers are compromised, they can...```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nbe used to launch attacks on other networked systems. Attack possibilities include the introduction of malware (e.g., a worm or virus) or the exploits of a single adversary compromising one computer at a time.

Once additional systems are compromised, all types of adverse consequences to the IT infrastructure are possible, including loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\nWhile the risk of network compromise through an RFID interface is considered low, it is possible, especially as the number of RFID reader, middleware, and enterprise applications increases. RFID air-interface protocols do not support the execution of remote commands on the RFID interface, but if the reader accepts data formats outside those expected by the protocol, then conceivably an adversary could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability on a reader by sending it non-compliant data. If the system is poorly designed, the adversary may be able to insert code or commands in memory buffers read by processes that can execute administrative functions such as disabling security controls. The potential consequence is that the adversary could gain full control of the device and use that control to attack other systems.\n\nAlthough no known instance of this type of attack has occurred in a real-world application, RFID security specialists have demonstrated RFID viruses in a controlled laboratory environment. An RFID virus is a small program encoded on a tag that becomes active once it has been read and is then passed to the middleware or database of an IT system. If the system is poorly designed, the virus could possibly take advantage of internal software weaknesses in middleware or database products to replicate itself to other tags. This distinguishes the risk from AIDC technologies such as bar codes that cannot be changed after manufacture because they do not contain modifiable memory.\n\nSome factors influencing the magnitude of the risk to the IT infrastructure and the applications they support are presented in Table 4-3.\n\n## 4.5 Summary",

The major categories of risk are as follows:\n\n- **Business Process Risk.** This encompasses threats and vulnerabilities that could cause part or all of the RFID system to fail. Potential impacts range from a deceleration of the business process to the loss of critical business or operational records. Business process risk can occur for many reasons, including human action (either benign or malicious) and natural causes. Factors influencing business process risk include the importance of the RFID-supported business processes to the mission of the organization, the robustness of business continuity planning, and the environment in which the RFID technology is located. The cloning of tags and attacks on enterprise subsystem networks are examples of threats to business processes.\n\n- **Business Intelligence Risk.** This involves threats and vulnerabilities that could permit unauthorized parties to gain access to sensitive or proprietary information. A competitor or adversary can gain\n```# Information from the RFID System\n\nInformation from the RFID system in a number of ways, including eavesdropping on RFID transactions, reading tags, and gaining access to RFID-related databases. The risk of unauthorized access is realized when the entity engaging in the unauthorized behavior does something harmful with that information. In some cases, the information may trigger an immediate response, such as breaking into a container holding valuable goods. In other cases, data may also be aggregated over time to provide intelligence related to an organization's customers, operations, business strategy, or proprietary methods.\n\n## Privacy Risk",

In the case of the latter, the primary privacy risk is likely borne by the consumer, not the organization that implemented the RFID system. Nevertheless, the RFID implementing organization still has privacy-related risks, including penalties from non-compliance with existing privacy regulations, legal liability, and the reaction of consumers, employees, public interest groups, and other stakeholders.\n\n## Externality Risk\n\nEvery connection point between an RFID system and other systems represents a potential vulnerability. One externality risk for an RF subsystem is hazards resulting from electromagnetic radiation, which could possibly range from adverse human health effects to ignition of combustible material, such as fuel or ordnance. The main externality risk for an enterprise subsystem is successful attacks on networked hosts and applications. Computer network attacks can involve malware or attack tools that exploit software vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses to gain access to systems, perform a denial of service, or cause other damage. The impact of computer network attacks can range from performance degradation to complete compromise of a mission-critical application.\n\n# RFID Security Controls\n\nThis section discusses security controls that can potentially mitigate the business risks associated with RFID systems. As previously discussed, RFID implementations are highly customized. As a result, the security controls listed are not all applicable or effective for all RFID applications. Organizations need to assess the risks they face and choose an appropriate mix of controls for their environments, taking into account factors such as regulatory requirements, the magnitude of the threat, cost, and performance.",
  "# RFID Security Controls\n\nThis section discusses security controls that can potentially mitigate the business risks associated with RFID systems.

Organizations need to assess the risks they face and choose an appropriate mix of controls for their environments, taking into account factors such as regulatory requirements, the magnitude of the threat, cost, and performance.\n\nFederal agencies should refer to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems and NIST Special Publication 800-53 (as amended), Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, when developing or revising policies related to an RFID system. NIST Special Publication 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers may also be helpful as it provides a broad overview of information security program elements to assist managers in.# Understanding How to Establish and Implement an Information Security Program\n\nThis section covers security controls applicable to most RFID implementations. It does not address the security of RFID-enabled smart cards and payment systems. This section also does not discuss security controls related to general IT systems, such as network infrastructure, databases, and Web servers because these are already covered by other security requirements and guidelines. For example, EPCIS servers, which can be accessed by trading partners through the Internet, should be protected by the same types of controls that would be used for any other Internet-facing system (e.g., encryption of sensitive communications, access control to prevent unauthorized access to data and systems) to ensure the security of the data collected by the RFID system. Guidelines on topics such as IT server, application, database, and network security are available from many sources, including NIST's Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC).\n\nRFID security is a rapidly evolving discipline. Although promising research is noted when applicable, this section focuses on controls that are presently commercially available. The RFID security controls discussed in this section are divided into three groups:\n\n- **Management.** A management control involves oversight of the security of the RFID system. For example, the management of an organization might need to update existing policies to address RFID implementations, such as security controls needed for an RF subsystem.",

For example, the management of an organization might need to update existing policies to address RFID implementations, such as security controls needed for an RF subsystem.\n\n- **Operational.** An operational control involves the actions performed on a daily basis by the system's administrators and users. For example, RFID systems need operational controls that ensure the physical security of the systems and their correct use.\n\n- **Technical.** A technical control uses technology to monitor or restrict the actions that can be performed within the system. RFID systems need technical controls for several reasons such as protecting data on tags, causing tags to self-destruct, and protecting wireless communications.\n\nThe information provided for each control includes:\n\n- A description of the control and how it works,\n- The types of implementations or applications where the control might be helpful,\n- The benefits that the control provides, such as which risks it mitigates, and\n- The weaknesses of the control, including why it might not be effective in some environments, and what residual risks and other concerns remain even if the control is implemented.\n\nThe summary at the end of Section 5 summarizes the controls and maps them to the risk categories discussed in Section 4.\n\n## 5.1 Management Controls\n\nManagement controls are typically involved in risk assessment, system planning, and system acquisition, as well as security certifications, accreditations, and assessments. The sub-sections below discuss management controls for RFID systems in more detail.\n\n### 5.1.1 RFID Usage Policy\n\n**Control:** An RFID usage policy describes the authorized and unauthorized uses of RFID technology in an organization and the personnel roles assigned to particular RFID system.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",

The usage policy also should be consistent or integrated with the organization's privacy policy, which addresses topics such as how personal information is stored and shared. The RFID usage policy should also address privacy issues associated with the tag identifier formats and the potential disclosure of information based solely on the tag identifier format selected. Additional information resources are found in the privacy guidelines in Section 6.\n\n### Applicability\nAll organizations that use RFID technologies or are considering using them.\n\n### Benefits\nThe policy establishes the framework for many other security controls.

A policy needs to be coupled with the implementation and enforcement of appropriate operational and technical controls to be effective.\n\n## 5.1.3 Agreements with External Organizations\n**Control:** When data associated with an RFID system needs to be shared across organizational boundaries, formal agreements among the participating organizations can codify the roles and responsibilities, and in some cases the legal liability, of each organization. These formal agreements are usually documented as a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).\n\nThe MOU or MOA specifies the network connections and authentication mechanisms to be used, the data to be shared, and the manner in which data should be protected both in transit and at rest. It may also address controls on vendors, subcontractors, and other third parties to the extent they have access to the system.\n\nIf the inter-enterprise application requires tag passwords to be shared across organizations, then the MOU or MOA should specify how these passwords will be generated, stored, and shared. The memorandum may specify IT security controls such as methods of authentication, access control, or encryption that participating organizations shall implement to protect the passwords.\n\n**Applicability:** Any RFID system involving more than one organization, which is most common in supply chain applications.\n\n**Benefits:** Having an MOA or MOU significantly reduces the potential for subsequent misunderstandings and security breaches. They enable signatories to communicate their respective security requirements while also realizing the benefits of the business partnership that led them to collaborate in the development and use of the RFID system.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Monitoring an external organization's enforcement of an agreement is difficult without full access to its systems and personnel, which is unlikely. As a result, violations may occur without detection. This risk can be mitigated with independent audits if signatories agree to hire third-parties to conduct such audits.",

For example, knowledge of the EPC manager ID and object class bits in certain EPC formats may reveal the make and model.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nof a tagged object concealed in a container. An adversary might target containers based on the perceived worth of their contents.\n\n- Placing data in the enterprise subsystem makes the availability of that data contingent on the availability of the network. Retrieving data over a network also introduces a small delay, which could be unacceptable for some applications. Section 3.3.3 discusses why organizations might choose to store data on tags even after taking into consideration the risks of doing so.\n\n## 5.2 Operational Controls\n\nThere are several types of operational controls:",

When the objective is to limit radio communication over a short distance, room walls or partitioned stalls might provide adequate protection if they are opaque to the relevant radio frequencies that the RF subsystem uses.\n\n**Applicability:** All RFID implementations except those in which RFID tags or other system components are in public areas.\n\n**Benefits:** Physical access controls limit the ability of an adversary to get close enough to RFID system components to compromise RFID data security or to modify, damage, or steal RFID system components. Physical security applies to all RFID subsystems. In the RF subsystem, the primary objective of the control is to prevent unauthorized radio communications. In the enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems, the primary objective is to prevent physical access to system components.\n\nExamples of risks that are mitigated by physical access controls include:",

Tags and readers can be kept away from:\n\n- Fuel, ordnance, and other materials that could cause harm if exposed to electromagnetic radiation.\n- Humans and sensitive products (e.g., blood, medicine) that might be harmed by sustained exposure to RF subsystem radiation.\n- Metal and reflective objects that can modify and amplify signals in unintended and potentially harmful ways.\n- Legitimate radios with which the RF subsystem communication will cause interference.\n\n**Applicability:** All environments in which the organization deploying RFID systems determines the location of the RF equipment (which excludes many consumer and supply chain applications).\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- Reduced risk of interference with legitimate radios.\n- Reduced risk of eavesdropping and unauthorized RF subsystem transactions.\n- Mitigation of HERF/HERO/HERP.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- Tag location cannot always be controlled, such as when tags are used to track mobile items (e.g., hospital cart) or items in transit (e.g., pallet on a truck).\n- Radio interference may persist even if the tags or readers are placed in a new location that is still sufficiently close to other radios.\n\n## 5.2.3 Secure Disposal of Tags",

Physical destruction may involve manual tearing or shredding using a paper shredder. Electronic destruction can be accomplished by using a tag's kill feature or using a strong electromagnetic field to render a tag's circuitry permanently inoperable. When a tag supports an electronic disabling mechanism, it usually is the preferred way to disable a tag before it is disposed because it can be accomplished without touching each tag, thereby reducing the cost of the effort. The kill feature is also discussed in Section 5.3.3.3.\n\n**Applicability:** RFID applications in which the continued operating presence of a tag after it has performed its intended function poses a business intelligence or privacy risk (e.g., an adversary can subsequently use the presence of the tag to track items or people).\n\n**Benefits:** Destroying or disabling tags:\n\n- Eliminates the possibility that they could be used later for tracking or targeting.\n- Prevents access to sensitive data stored on tags.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nThese benefits apply to both business intelligence and privacy risks.\n\n## Weaknesses:\n- Even if minimal, the effort it takes to destroy a tag increases the tag's life cycle cost, which is a concern if very low costs are required to justify an RFID-enabled business process.\n- Destruction of a tag precludes the ability to use it for future value-added applications such as post-sale product support, targeted recalls, receipt-free returns, expiration date monitoring, and sorting assistance for recycling.",

In most RFID implementations, personnel will perform various roles, which might require different training materials for each role. For example, an administrator of middleware might need different information than an operator of a mobile reader. Appropriate security and privacy training addresses at least three points:\n- What constitutes unauthorized use,\n- How to detect that unauthorized use might be occurring, and\n- To whom to report violations.\n\nIf HERF/HERO/HERP risks are present, appropriate security training covers mitigation techniques, such as safe handling distances. If tags are destroyed or recycled, training should cover how to perform these functions. For example, operators might be trained how to clear tag memory before reuse.\n\n**Applicability:** All RFID implementations.\n\n**Benefits:** Operator training helps ensure that the system is used and maintained properly. Training also helps operators identify security violations and take appropriate actions to prevent their reoccurrence.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Training alone cannot ensure proper operation of the system or compliance with policy.",

The notice may inform users of the purposes of the RFID system or advise users on how to minimize privacy or other risks (e.g., place an RFID-enabled access card or transponder in metal foil or a sleeve that shields RF radiation when the card or transponder is not in use).\n\n**Applicability:** All applications in which there is a risk that could be mitigated with simple informational messages. The control is particularly relevant to consumer applications in which privacy is a concern.\n\n**Benefits:** Information labels or notices can communicate basic information about risks that might otherwise be left unknown by users that are able to take simple steps to mitigate the risk (e.g., remove a tag or place it in a shielded sleeve).\n\n**Weaknesses:** Distributing a notice is no guarantee that it will be read or understood. Notice is not an appropriate communications medium for complex concepts or instructions that may require formal training.\n\n## 5.2.6 Separation of Duties\n**Control:** RFID system duties are distributed among various personnel roles to minimize the damage resulting from an inadvertent or malicious activity of a single person. The# General Principle of the Control\n\nThe general principle of the control is that malicious collusion between two or more authorized users is much less likely than one person engaging alone in inappropriate behavior.\n\n## Example of Separation of Duties",

The# General Principle of the Control\n\nThe general principle of the control is that malicious collusion between two or more authorized users is much less likely than one person engaging alone in inappropriate behavior.\n\n## Example of Separation of Duties\n\nOne example of separation of duties is having different personnel (1) attach tags to objects and (2) read the tags. If an individual performed both functions, the individual could intentionally put the wrong tag on an object to circumvent the objectives of the business process. For example, a store clerk could affix tags intended for low-priced items on high-priced items, and then later work the checkout scanner while the clerk's accomplice purchased the items. The system would not know that the tags had been switched, but if another person performed the checkout, he or she might be suspicious of the checkout total, which could uncover the plot.\n\n### Applicability\n\nRFID applications in which an insider might have a motive to perform unauthorized RFID transactions. This scenario is most likely to occur when tags support commercial transactions, especially those related to high-value objects.\n\n### Benefits\n\nSeparation of duties helps to reduce fraud and malicious damage, because any user attempting to engage in such activities would be forced to collude with at least one other user. Separation of duties also reduces errors, because a second operator will often catch mistakes made or missed by the first.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nMultiple employees still could collude to commit fraud or violate the RFID usage policy. Also, organizations with a limited staff may not be able to perform complete separation of duties.\n\n## 5.2.7 Non-revealing Identifier Formats\n\n### Control",

Also, organizations with a limited staff may not be able to perform complete separation of duties.\n\n## 5.2.7 Non-revealing Identifier Formats\n\n### Control\n\nRFID tags are assigned identifiers using identifier formats that do not reveal any information about tagged items or the organization operating the RFID system. Non-revealing identifier format options include serially assigning identifiers and randomly assigning identifiers.\n\nIn contrast, if an adversary reads an identifier that is encoded with a standardized format, such as the EPC format, that adversary may be able to discern the manufacturer or issuer of the item, as well as the type of item. For example, all cans of a soft drink from a certain manufacturer will have the same EPC manager ID and object class bits if their identifiers are encoded in an EPC identifier format. Figure 5-1 shows an example 96-bit EPC and how it can be parsed into the four aforementioned individual fields.\n\nTags must have programmable identifiers to support the control. Even tags that are designed to support standard tag formats can still be assigned non-standard identifiers in the field. However, some tags have factory-initialized identifiers that cannot be modified after manufacture.\n\n### Applicability\n\nAny applications in which the implementing organization determines that the revelation of a tag's identifier is a business intelligence risk.\n\n### Benefits\n\nAdversaries cannot obtain information about tagged items from the identifier alone.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- The use of non-revealing identifier precludes an organization from realizing benefits that come from standard identifier formats that reveal organization and item type information. For example, standard# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Identifier Formats",

For example, standard# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Identifier Formats\n\nIdentifier formats are particularly advantageous when designing and maintaining distributed databases in inter-enterprise systems. Lookup and query functions are much easier in such databases when the identifiers provide information on where item data is located.\n\n- If identifiers are assigned randomly, then a potential exists that two tags may be assigned the same identifier. The likelihood of such an event is very small, but it could lead to errors in the supported business process.\n- If there is logic in how the identifiers are assigned, an adversary may uncover the method that is used, which would defeat the control. For example, an adversary knows that an identifier was assigned to a certain item and that all items of that type were assigned sequentially, then the adversary may be able to deduce the approximate range of identifiers that correspond to items of that type. Similarly, when identifiers are serialized, the adversary may be able to deduce the approximate time of the assignment based on the identifier.\n\n## 5.2.8 Fallback Identification System\n\n**Control:** A fallback identification system provides an alternative means to identify, authenticate, or verify an object when the RFID system is unavailable or an individual tag is inoperable. Options include text labels and AIDC technology such as bar codes. The fallback may consist of just an identifier, or it may also include additional data about the tagged object. The fallback system is accompanied by standard operating procedures and operator training to ensure that personnel know when and how to use it.\n\n**Applicability:** All RFID applications.\n\n**Benefits:** Duplicating tag identifiers and data on a label provides a fallback in case of malicious or accidental tag damage, reader malfunction, or enterprise subsystem network outage. The redundant data can also be used to verify that tag data has not been altered improperly.",

Similarly, many enterprise subsystem outages that would affect the RFID system would also affect its fallback alternative.\n- The data stored on the label is visible, so it may be easier for unauthorized parties to gain access to it than it would be to read the data from the tag.\n- The text label or bar code might not provide the same data capacity as RFID memory, although two-dimensional bar codes can encode at least as many bits as standards-based tag identifiers.\n- Text labels and AIDC technologies are static, so they do not provide a complete fallback solution for applications in which tag data changes over time. However, some identification information is still likely to be better than none in most applications.\n\n## 5.3 Technical Controls\n\nThere are a number of technical controls currently available for RFID systems, and many others are under development in industrial and university research labs.

This section focuses on technical controls that are commercially available as of the publication date of this document. Supplementary information on selected emerging security technologies is provided in footnotes. Many of the# Technical Controls in RFID Systems\n\nThe technical controls listed are specified in standards, while others are available only in proprietary systems. Many technical controls related to a tag require the tag to perform additional computations and to have additional volatile memory. Accordingly, a tag that uses such technical controls requires a more sophisticated microchip than those that do not use such controls. In the case of passive tags, the tags may also need to be closer to readers to obtain the required power to perform these computations. Alternatively, readers may need to operate at greater power levels, although this may not be feasible or permitted in many cases. These inherent characteristics of passive tags can limit the use of certain technical controls in some environments.\n\nTechnical controls exist for all components of RFID systems, including the RF, enterprise, and inter-enterprise subsystems. This section focuses on technical controls for the RF subsystem. Many controls also exist for the enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems, but these typically apply to IT systems in general rather than to RFID systems in particular. Readers are encouraged to read other NIST IT system and network security guidelines, many of which are listed in Appendix D.\n\n## General Types of RF Subsystem Controls\n\nThe general types of RF subsystem controls include controls to:\n\n- Provide authentication and integrity services to RFID components and transactions,\n- Protect RF communication between reader and tag, and\n- Protect the data stored on tags.\n\nExamples of each of these types of controls are discussed in depth in Sections 5.3.1 through 5.3.3, respectively.\n\n### 5.3.1 Authentication and Data Integrity",

In some cases, the primary objective of the authentication technology is to prevent unauthorized reading from or writing to tags. In other cases, the objective is to detect cloning of tags. Authentication techniques based on cryptography often provide integrity services for data included in the authentication transaction; in other words, an adversary cannot modify data in the transaction without the reader or tag detecting the change.\n\n#### 5.3.1.1 Password Authentication\n\nControl: A tag does not permit password-protected commands to be executed unless they are accompanied by the correct password. Protected commands may include those that support reading and writing of tag data, memory access control (Section 5.3.3.1), and the kill feature (Section 5.3.3.3). Organizations properly implementing this control will develop a password management system to support it. The password management system addresses all stages of the password, including generation, conveyance, and storage. From a security perspective, effective password generation involves random selection of each password. Whenever possible, the passwords are assigned to each tag in a physically secure environment to reduce the likelihood of eavesdropping.

In cases such as these, the compromise of a single password could compromise the integrity of the entire system.\n- RFID passwords can be obtained through brute force methods (i.e., cycling through all possible passwords) when the tag technology is limited to short passwords.\n- RFID passwords can be revealed through power analysis attacks on some types of passive tags.\n\n### 5.3.1.2 Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)\n**Control:** Both the reader and the tag share a common secret key that can be used in combination with a hash algorithm to provide one-way or mutual authentication between tag and reader. When HMAC is applied to messages, it also ensures the integrity of data in the messages. HMAC is specified in FIPS Publication 198. HMAC supports any cryptographic hash algorithm, but Federal agencies must use one of the secure hash algorithms (SHA) specified in FIPS Publication 180-2.

Applications that require evidence of a tag's authenticity.\n\n## Benefits\nThe advantages of HMAC relative to password authentication include that HMAC:\n- Provides evidence of tag's authenticity,\n- Provides integrity protection, and\n- Does not transmit secrets over-the-air, which eliminates the risk of eavesdropping inherent with clear text passwords.\n\n## Weaknesses\n- The management of HMAC keys provides similar challenges to those of password management.# Management and HMAC Key Management\n\n- May not be practical if mobile readers do not have reliable access to an HMAC key management system.\n- The authenticity claims associated with HMAC authentication only hold when the HMAC key remains secret. If an adversary has physical access to a tag and can obtain its HMAC key, then the adversary can clone the tag. This attack, however, assumes that the adversary has some level of expertise, both in reverse engineering the HMAC-capable tag and in producing a reasonable facsimile.\n- When HMAC keys are shared across organizations, authenticity claims rely on an implicit trust between the organizations that may not be present in practice.\n- HMAC requires greater computing power than password comparisons, and therefore requires more complex tag designs to support it.\n\n## 5.3.1.3 Digital Signatures\n\n**Control:** Readers digitally sign tag identifiers, time stamps, and related event data to provide for non-repudiation of tag transactions. The resulting signatures are stored on tags for subsequent verification, although recording signatures in enterprise subsystem databases provides additional assurance of the tag's chain of custody.",

The resulting signatures are stored on tags for subsequent verification, although recording signatures in enterprise subsystem databases provides additional assurance of the tag's chain of custody.\n\nDigital signatures are based on asymmetric cryptography, also commonly referred to as public key cryptography. Federal agencies implementing digital signature technology must comply with FIPS Publication 196, Entity Authentication Using Public Key Cryptography. The use of digital signature technology in the context of RFID systems is also referred to as authenticated RFID. It typically works as follows:\n\n1. The tag has a permanent unique identifier that cannot be modified after manufacture.\n2. The reader generates a public/private key pair and obtains a corresponding public key certificate.\n3. The reader uses a specified hash algorithm to compute a message digest of the tag's identifier and possibly other transaction-related data, encrypts the message digest with its private key to create a digital signature for the transaction, and stores the resulting signature on the tag.\n4. Other readers read the signature, decrypt it with the first reader's public key, and compute the identical message digest to determine if a match exists. If the message digests match, then the verification procedure provides assurance of the authenticity of the earlier transaction. If the message digests do not match, then either the transaction data has been altered or an unauthorized device created the digital signature.\n5. The other readers can store their own event transactions on the tag or record them in enterprise subsystem databases for later queries regarding the tag's chain of custody.\n\n**Applicability:** Applications that require more robust evidence of authenticity than provided by HMAC technology, including authentication of multiple chain of custody events. Applications that require verification of authenticity without network connectivity.\n\n**Benefits:** Digital signatures offer several advantages relative to HMAC authentication, including:# Digital Signature Systems",

Applications that require verification of authenticity without network connectivity.\n\n**Benefits:** Digital signatures offer several advantages relative to HMAC authentication, including:# Digital Signature Systems\n\n- Digital signature systems do not require tags to store cryptographic secrets. Instead, readers maintain private keys. In password and HMAC authentication, both the tag and the reader must share a secret for the system to function, but there are no shared secrets in the public key cryptosystems that support digital signatures. Tags are typically much more vulnerable to compromise than readers, so eliminating the need to store secrets on tags enhances overall system security. One private key and one or more public key certificates are on the reader. Integrity is needed for the certificates, but not confidentiality.\n\n- In many cases, digital signatures do not require network connectivity to successfully perform the authentication function. In password and HMAC authentication, a reader is unlikely to have the memory to store the passwords or keys for large numbers of tags. With digital signatures, a reader may only need to store the public key certificate of the entity that initialized the tags or perhaps a relatively small number of readers. In inter-enterprise systems, each participating organization only has to share the public keys of its readers rather than provide its partners reliable network access to a password or secret key database.\n\n- Digital signatures are compatible with existing RFID tag standards. HMAC requires tags to support hash algorithms and to implement a challenge-response protocol, neither of which are included in existing RFID standards. On the other hand, in authenticated RFID systems, tags can receive, store, and transmit digital signatures with existing read and write commands because the complexity resides in readers or middleware.\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\n- A system of digital signatures requires a public key infrastructure (PKI), including registration and certification authorities, revocation functions, and associated policies and practice statements. Successfully implementing and operating a PKI requires careful planning and considerable expertise. In addition, readers or middleware need to support digital signature and other PKI functionality that is not commonly found in current RFID technology.",

On the other hand, in authenticated RFID systems, tags can receive, store, and transmit digital signatures with existing read and write commands because the complexity resides in readers or middleware.\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\n- A system of digital signatures requires a public key infrastructure (PKI), including registration and certification authorities, revocation functions, and associated policies and practice statements. Successfully implementing and operating a PKI requires careful planning and considerable expertise. In addition, readers or middleware need to support digital signature and other PKI functionality that is not commonly found in current RFID technology.\n\n- Digital signatures systems require more memory than found on many current tags. For example, NIST recommends that RSA signatures have a length of 1024 bits, and a length of 2048 bits after 2010. Additional memory is required to store identifying information related to the transaction. Providing chain of custody evidence requires storing a digital signature and related identifying information for each transaction.\n\n- Digital signatures that are not generated by the tag are subject to replay attacks. An adversary could query a tag to obtain its evidence of authenticity (i.e., the digital signature created by a previous reader) and then replicate that data on a cloned tag.\n\n- The use of digital signatures to support authentication of readers to tags would require tags to support relatively complex cryptographic functions beyond the capacity of most common tag designs.

The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 cover-coding protocol works as follows:\n\n1. The reader sends a message to the tag requesting a key.\n2.

By itself, the XOR operation would be considered a trivial encryption algorithm in traditional cryptography, but it nonetheless mitigates risk to an acceptable level in many RFID environments.\n\nFigure 5-2 illustrates how cover-coding works. As shown in the figure, the passive tag's back channel signal is weaker than the reader's forward channel signal. This will always be the case for a passive tag, which must use the forward channel to power both its computations and the backscattered signal. In the figure, the adversary is able to eavesdrop on the forward channel but not the back channel. So long as this condition holds, the adversary will not be able to learn the random number sent from the tag and therefore will be unable to decipher cover coded information.# Applicability\nCover coding is useful when eavesdropping is a risk that requires mitigation, but adversaries are expected to be at a greater distance from the tags than readers. Intelligible reception of back channel signals from a passive tag requires proximity of less than four meters in most applications. In many applications, an adversary's reception equipment would be conspicuous if it were located within this range. In contrast, reader signals can be detected at distances of a kilometer or more under ideal conditions. Cover-coding is designed for RF subsystems in which the forward channel carries stronger signals than the back channel, which essentially limits the control to passive tags. EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 technologies support cover-coding. Proprietary technologies support similar features.\n\n## Benefits\nCover-coding helps prevent the execution of unauthorized commands that could disable a tag or modify the tag's data. Consequently, cover-coding mitigates business process, business intelligence, and privacy risks.",
  "## Benefits\nCover-coding helps prevent the execution of unauthorized commands that could disable a tag or modify the tag's data. Consequently, cover-coding mitigates business process, business intelligence, and privacy risks.\n\n## Weaknesses\n- If an adversary can intercept a key distributed on the back channel, the adversary could decrypt any ciphertext message generated with that key.\n- The effectiveness of cover-coding depends on the performance of the tag's random number generator. If the random number is predictable due to a flaw in the tag's design or cryptanalysis, then an adversary can learn the key and decrypt subsequent communication.\n\n# 5.3.2.2 Encryption of Data in Transit\n## Control\nData collected or processed by the tag is encrypted prior to over-the-air transmission.\n\n## Applicability\nApplications that require an effective countermeasure to the threat of eavesdropping and for which cover coding offers inadequate protections. Tags typically only require on-board encryption capabilities to protect the confidentiality of data in transit if they collect or process data from sensors or other directly connected sources. In these cases, no alternative exists to hide the content of the data over-the-air because the data originates on the tag. On-board cryptography for confidentiality is not required for applications in which readers are the only source of data. In these cases, the data can be encrypted in the enterprise subsystem or by a reader before it is written to the tag and then retrieved in its encrypted form from the tag when needed. If the tag never has to perform computations on the data, then it never has to decrypt it, but merely store it. Encryption of data at rest is also discussed in Section 5.3.3.2. Proprietary tag designs support encryption for over-the-air confidentiality, but EPCglobal and ISO/IEC 18000 standards do not as of the date of this publication.\n\n## Benefits\nEncryption of data in transit prevents successful eavesdropping of over-the-air RFID transactions.\n\n## Weaknesses\n- Data encryption requires a key management system, which can be complex to manage and operate.\n- Cryptographic functions may introduce an unacceptable delay in RFID systems that require very fast read or write transactions.\n- Cryptographic functions require additional power to complete, which could# Impact Applications that Use Passive Tags",

One reason for the increased cost is that onboard encryption requires additional logic gates to perform the necessary computations. Most low-cost passive tags do not have enough logic gates to perform complex encryption algorithms.\n\n## 5.3.2.3 Electromagnetic Shielding\n\n**Control:** RF shielding encloses an area with a conducting material that limits the propagation of RF signals outside of the shielded area. Shielding can vary in size and form depending on the application. For example, some RFID-enabled travel documents are protected by a metallic anti-skimming material. This material helps to prevent adversaries from reading the embedded tag when the passport cover is closed. Shipping containers are sometimes shielded to prevent the reading of tags during transit. Shielding is also placed in walls, partitions, or stalls to prevent RF emissions from leaving a confined area. When readers are placed in tunnels on industrial production conveyor belts, the tunnels may be shielded to reduce radio interference. Wrapping a tag in aluminum foil is also an effective means of shielding.\n\nFigure 5-3 shows how shielded partitions can separate collocated readers to prevent interference. The readers near forklift A can operate without inadvertently reading tags on boxes on forklift B due to the shielding in the partition that separates the portals. Shielding may be necessary when middleware is unable to correctly filter duplicate read events from the two portals.\n\n**Applicability:** Shielding is applicable for contexts in which eavesdropping or RF radiation is a concern, and the use of temporary shielding would not stop valid transactions.\n\n**Benefits:** Shielding can limit the ability of eavesdroppers or unauthorized readers to collect data from an RFID system.",

For example, shielded containers require objects to be physically removed from the shielding material. This prevents an implementing organization from realizing one of the key benefits of RFID technology, which is to read tags remotely without optical line of sight and additional handling.\n- It may still be possible for an adversary to place a radio inside the shielded area. The radio could be used for malicious purposes, such as eavesdropping on RFID transactions or causing interference.\n\n## 5.3.2.4 Radio Frequency Selection\n\n**Control:** RFID technology can communicate over various radio frequencies, including those in the LF, HF, UHF, and microwave bands. Particular fixed frequencies can be assigned to an RFID application to avoid or reduce the effects of radio interference. Some tag technologies can perform frequency hopping within a limited frequency range, but in these cases, the technique is used primarily to avoid collisions with other tag transactions, not radio interference with different types of radio systems. In some cases, the implementing organization may need to obtain a license to use a particular...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## desired frequency.\nTable 2-2 in Section 2.3.1.3 lists potential sources of interference on common RFID frequencies.\n\nIdeally, an RF site survey will be performed before an RFID system is installed to determine what frequencies are already in use.

  "## desired frequency.\nTable 2-2 in Section 2.3.1.3 lists potential sources of interference on common RFID frequencies.\n\nIdeally, an RF site survey will be performed before an RFID system is installed to determine what frequencies are already in use. After the RFID system is installed, site surveys can be conducted to determine if the RF characteristics of the site have changed (e.g., new sources of interference).\n\n### Applicability:\nAll implementations whose radio frequency is not determined by other application requirements. Organizations that implement a closed RFID system have more freedom to select an operating frequency because they do not have to interoperate with other organizations. However, if tags are based on a particular air interface standard, the range of potential frequencies will be limited to those supported by the standard.\n\n### Benefits:\nRadio frequency selection permits the avoidance of RF interference with other radio systems that could disrupt the RFID system or other technologies. A particular frequency might be desirable because of radio interference on other frequency bands. Some frequencies also have desirable propagation characteristics, such as the ability to penetrate certain materials.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n- It may be difficult to identify sources of interference. For example, bug zappers have been found to create interference in passive RFID trials. Interference can be caused by poorly grounded motors, noisy relays, old fluorescent light ballasts, and other devices that generate unintended RF noise in nearby environments. Each RFID technology deployment should be tested in its intended environment prior to production use to identify these sources of interference.\n- New sources of interference can be later introduced at the site.\n- When implementing an inter-enterprise RFID system, all organizations involved in the system will have to agree on a tag type that supports all the frequencies that the organizations collectively intend to use.\n\n## 5.3.2.5 Adjustment of Transmission Characteristics Other than Frequency Control:\nOperators adjust the level of transmitted RF energy from a reader or active tag. The use of particular antenna types and configurations can also determine the direction of transmitted RF energy. Additionally, the duty cycle of a reader can be controlled.\n\n### Applicability:\nAll applications for which eavesdropping, radio interference, or hazards of electromagnetic radiation are a concern.\n\n### Benefits:\nReducing transmitted power can:\n- Reduce the likelihood that an adversary can intercept communication,\n- Limit radio interference with other legitimate radios, and\n- Lessen hazards of electromagnetic radiation.",

Also, changes in the physical environment or the introduction of new radio equipment can impact the power levels required for consistently successful transactions. Consequently, the benefits of power adjustments based on a site survey can be negated by.```markdown\n# Changes to the Environment\n\n## 5.3.2.6 Temporary Deactivation of Tags\n\n**Control:** The RF interface on some proprietary tags can be turned off temporarily. Tag manufacturers have different methods of turning their tags on and off. For example, some tags are designed so that the tag is on or off depending upon which end is inserted into a mounting clip. Other tags have replaceable batteries that can be removed to deactivate them.\n\nIf the control is implemented, tags would be turned on inside a designated area where the RF subsystem operates. When the tags leave that area, they would be turned off. For example, in a supply chain application, tags may be turned off to prevent unauthorized transactions during shipment. When the tags arrive at their destination, they would be powered on again and managed. Conversely, tags used for in-transit visibility may be turned on for their trip and turned off when they reach their destination.\n\n**Applicability:** This control is most useful when communication between readers and a tag is infrequent and predictable. For example, a warehouse might store items for an annual event, such as a holiday celebration or parade. In this case, the RFID confers a benefit only for a short period each year, but could remain vulnerable to rogue transactions if left operational for the rest of the year.",

The potential increased labor required to operate the system could negatively affect the business case for RFID relative to other AIDC technologies.\n- Even if the activation and deactivation process is automated, it introduces a delay that might not be acceptable for many time-sensitive applications.\n\n## 5.3.2.7 Tag Press-to-Activate Switch\n\n**Control:** The tag remains deactivated by default unless a user or operator takes a positive action, such as holding a press-to-activate switch on the tag to turn it on. When the switch is on, the tag is capable of RF communication, but when pressure on the switch is released, the tag returns to its default deactivated status so that tag transactions can no longer occur.\n\n**Applicability:** Primarily access control or automated payment applications in which the holder of the tag desires or requires control over when tag transactions occur.",

Consequently, this control mitigates privacy and business intelligence risks by providing a countermeasure to the threat of eavesdropping and the execution of unauthorized tag commands. Eavesdropping would be limited to the immediate vicinity of authorized readers and tracking.\n```# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nbeyond the immediate vicinity of the authorized readers would not be possible.\nThis control also provides assurance that a person is knowingly in possession of the tag, and that it has not been intentionally or inadvertently separated from that person. For example, this control could be useful in ticketing or access control applications in which the objective is to get an accurate count of the number of individuals present, and to prevent spare tags in pockets or bags from interfering with the accuracy of the count.\n\n## Weaknesses:\n- Requiring the user to activate the tag would require some level of instruction, however minimal, which might add a cost or delay in the business process. For example, the user would need to know when and for how long they would need to activate the tag.\n- Some users may consider activating a switch to be an inconvenience, which could hinder user acceptance of the technology.\n- A press-to-activate switch could distract the user from other functions that the user is performing. For example, a press-to-activate switch is not an appropriate control for an automated toll-payment system because the user needs to have both hands available for driving the vehicle.",

Examples include medical facilities that require real-time inventory of certain medical supplies or systems that collect sensor data. Tag polling also is applicable for high-value business processes that require early indications of system failures or performance problems. This control is most effective in applications in which those with access to the tags are trusted or when detaching the tag is not feasible (e.g., when a tag is embedded in another item such as a poker chip).\n\n**Benefits:** Operators obtain timely information about system failures, item theft, or unusual environmental conditions that enables them to proactively address problems.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Tag polling:\n- Reduces the battery life of active and semi-active tags,\n- May not detect critical events in a timely manner if the polling frequency is too low,\n- Is a business intelligence risk if the tag polling enables an adversary to perform traffic analysis, or track or target tags that might have otherwise remained silent, and.\n- Could be circumvented in some cases by detaching the tag, taking the item, and leaving the tag behind so that it continues to signal its presence to readers.\n\n### 5.3.3 Tag Data Protection\nTechnical controls currently available for protecting tag data include:\n- Tag memory access control, which can restrict use of tag commands and protect data stored in a tag's memory,\n- Encrypting the data on tags,\n- The kill feature, which can prevent subsequent unauthorized use of a tag, and\n- Tamper protection.",

For example, the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 has five areas of memory, each of which can be protected using the lock command. The memory is either both read- and write-protected, or only write-protected, depending on the parameters issued with the command. The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 UHF standard also has a permalock feature. If engaged, permalock will make the lock status (locked or unlocked) permanent for all or part of a tag's memory. ISO/IEC 18000-3 Mode 2 supports both read and write protecting all areas of memory with a 48-bit memory access password. Finally, Mode 2 of the ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard describes a lock pointer, which is a memory address. All areas of memory with a lower address than the lock pointer are write-protected, while those areas of memory above the pointer address are not.\n\nThe effectiveness of tag memory access controls depend on proper management of passwords. Section 5.3.1.1 provides additional information on password authentication.",
  "The effectiveness of tag memory access controls depend on proper management of passwords. Section 5.3.1.1 provides additional information on password authentication.\n\n### Applicability:\nAll applications that store data on tags.\n\n### Benefits:\nA write-protect lock command will prevent the contents of a tag's memory from being altered. A read-protect lock command will prevent unauthorized users from reading or accessing the data on tags.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n- The password length on many tags is too short to provide meaningful memory access protection. Even when the technology supports longer passwords, password management is challenging (see Section 5.3.1.1 on password authentication for additional information).\n- Locking a tag's memory does not prevent data loss from electromagnetic interference or physical tag destruction.\n\n## 5.3.3.2 Encryption of Data at Rest\n\n### Control:\nData stored on a tag is encrypted before it is written to the tag. The control does not require that the tag encrypt or decrypt data. Instead, the encryption is performed by either the reader, middleware, or other enterprise subsystem components.\n\n### Applicability:\nAll applications that store additional data beyond an identifier on the tag that needs to be kept confidential on the tag. If the encryption and decryption functions are performed in the enterprise subsystem, then network access is required to read the content of data stored on the tag, which makes the control unsuitable for mobile readers that do not always have real-time network access.\n\n### Benefits:\nData encryption protects sensitive tag data from being read by individuals with unauthorized access to the tags.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n- Data encryption requires a key management system, which can be complex to manage and operate.\n- Sending tag data to network components for encryption or decryption is a source of network latency, when in conjunction with the time to complete cryptographic functions may introduce an unacceptable delay in RFID systems that require very fast read or write transactions.\n\n## 5.3.3.3 Kill Feature\n\n### Control:\nThe kill feature permanently disables a tag's functionality using a# Remote Command\n\nThe most common implementation of the kill feature is the EPCglobal kill command.

For example, discarded tags that have not been disabled may be read by adversaries to gain access to data, such as which products an organization or individual is purchasing or using.\n\n- The existence of a kill feature represents a significant business process threat to an RFID system. If an adversary who learns the kill password improperly disables tags that should remain in operation, the supported application will not function properly because it will not be able to perform transactions on the disabled tags. This risk is particularly salient for organizations that assign the same password to multiple tags because doing so could enable an adversary to disable large numbers of tags with a single compromised password.\n- Once killed, a tag cannot be used for any further application involving the asset (e.g., recalls, receiptless product returns).\n- If an organization assigns a weak (e.g., short or easily guessed) password for the kill command, unauthorized parties can kill the tag at will. Moreover, the longer a tag maintains the same password, the more likely it is that the password will be compromised.\n- Data stored on the tag is still present in the tag's memory after it is killed (although it can no longer be accessed wirelessly), and therefore still may be accessible to someone with physical access to the tag.\n- Although the kill command was added to tags as a potential solution for privacy concerns, consumers cannot easily detect whether a tag has been deactivated. Moreover, typical consumers cannot easily kill tags on their own because this action requires a reader and knowledge of the kill password.\n\n## 5.3.3.4 Tamper Resistance",
  "## 5.3.3.4 Tamper Resistance\n\n**Control:** Certain RFID tags have tamper resistant or tamper-evident features that help prevent an adversary from altering the tags or removing them from the objects to which they are attached. One simple type of tamper resistance is the use of a frangible, or easily broken, antenna; if a tag of this type is removed, the electric connection with the antenna is severed, rendering the tag inoperable. Other, more complex types of RFID systems monitor the integrity of objects associated with the tags to ensure that the objects have not been compromised, altered, or subjected to extreme conditions.\n\n**Applicability:** Applications in which tags are frequently outside of the direct.# Control of the Implementing Organization\n\nControl of the implementing organization and therefore vulnerable to tampering.

This is dependent upon the implementation of the tamper resistance feature. For example, a sophisticated adversary may be able to repair a frangible antenna. In addition, tamper-resistance / tamper-evidence technologies do not prevent the theft or destruction of the tag or its associated items.\n\n# 5.4 Summary\n\nOrganizations should use a combination of management, operational, and technical controls to mitigate the business risks of implementing RFID systems. Table 5-1 maps the presented controls to the categories of risks that they mitigate. Because each RFID implementation is highly customized and each organization's requirements are different, the security controls discussed in this section are not all applicable or effective for all RFID applications. Organizations need to assess the risks their RFID implementations face and choose the appropriate controls, taking into account factors such as regulatory requirements, the magnitude of threats, and cost and performance implications of the controls. For example, a remote warehouse may have little need to protect against eavesdropping, but it may require redundant processes in case of system failure. Traditional security controls are often preferable to RFID-specific controls. For example, if RFID data can be stored in an enterprise database rather than on tags, then physical and network security controls for the database server probably are more practical than using tags with cryptographic capabilities.\n\n# 6. RFID Privacy Considerations\n\nWhile this document is primarily about securing RFID systems, privacy issues are often interrelated with security considerations in a manner that one cannot be discussed without the other. For example, protecting privacy often requires technical security controls related to data confidentiality. This section explains what types of information are considered personal, reviews a number of privacy considerations that impact the life cycle of RFID systems, explains general privacy controls, and lists privacy guidance with which US Federal agencies are required to comply.",
  "# 6. RFID Privacy Considerations\n\nWhile this document is primarily about securing RFID systems, privacy issues are often interrelated with security considerations in a manner that one cannot be discussed without the other. For example, protecting privacy often requires technical security controls related to data confidentiality. This section explains what types of information are considered personal, reviews a number of privacy considerations that impact the life cycle of RFID systems, explains general privacy controls, and lists privacy guidance with which US Federal agencies are required to comply.\n\nPrivacy regulations and guidance are often complex and change over time. Organizations planning, implementing, or managing an RFID system should always consult with the organization's privacy officer, legal counsel, and chief information officer when developing and enforcing privacy policy related to the system.\n\n## 6.1 Types of Personal Information# Federal Privacy Laws and RFID Systems\n\nFederal privacy laws predominantly address the requirements for assessing, managing and safeguarding data defined as personal information. Figure 7-1 provides a taxonomy of personal information that is useful in describing privacy considerations for RFID systems.\n\n## Personal Information Distinctions\n\nFor the purposes of current privacy regulation, the most important distinction about the information being addressed is whether personal information is personally identifiable information (PII) or non-personally identifiable information. PII is information that can be used to uniquely identify, locate, or contact an individual. Examples of data elements that typically are considered PII include, but are not limited to, an individual's full name, social security number, passport number, financial account or credit card numbers, and biometric data such as fingerprints. Individual data elements associated with characteristics that many people share are generally not considered PII. Examples include age, gender, city of residence, religious affiliation, and medical conditions.\n\nSometimes multiple pieces of information, none of which alone is considered PII, might still uniquely identify a person when combined. For example, NIST may employ only one 39-year old female with a residence in Roanoke, Virginia. In this case, the employer, age, gender, and city of residence are not PII elements by themselves, but become PII when they are presented together. This scenario is an example of PII established through indirect inference, while data elements such as a driver's license number constitute PII through direct inference.\n\n## Privacy Laws and PII Management",
  "Sometimes multiple pieces of information, none of which alone is considered PII, might still uniquely identify a person when combined. For example, NIST may employ only one 39-year old female with a residence in Roanoke, Virginia. In this case, the employer, age, gender, and city of residence are not PII elements by themselves, but become PII when they are presented together. This scenario is an example of PII established through indirect inference, while data elements such as a driver's license number constitute PII through direct inference.\n\n## Privacy Laws and PII Management\n\nAs a general rule, privacy laws govern the management of PII inferred through both direct and indirect means. The same laws, however, usually do not address data elements that individuals perceive as personal information but do not meet the criteria of PII as defined by the E-Government Act of 2002. For example, people anonymously walking down the street may perceive a loss of privacy if someone with a reader can ascertain the books they are reading or the medicine they are taking, but not their identities, by remotely scanning various tagged items in a bag, purse or on one's person. In this case, the individuals remain anonymous but may perceive a compromise of privacy because they do not have control over the personal information they reveal to others. To address these concerns, organizations implementing RFID systems may choose to mitigate the risk associated with these scenarios. In these cases, the range of privacy considerations is not limited to those required by law.\n\n## 6.2 The Applicability of Privacy Considerations to RFID Systems\n\nRFID systems support a large variety of business processes, not all of which involve personal privacy. Examples of RFID systems that likely do not have privacy considerations include those supporting industrial processes, animal tracking, and asset management systems in which the assets are never associated with individuals during their life cycle. Privacy considerations exist when the system uses, collects, stores, or discloses personal information. An RFID system might use or disclose personal information in one of several ways:\n\n- Personal information such as a name or account number may be stored on the tag or in a database in# The Enterprise Subsystem",

An RFID system might use or disclose personal information in one of several ways:\n\n- Personal information such as a name or account number may be stored on the tag or in a database in# The Enterprise Subsystem\n\n- A tag may be associated with a personal item such as a blood sample, a bottle of prescription medicine, or a folder of legal documents that might be outside of the individual's possession.\n- A tag may be associated with an item that often travels with an individual, such as a tagged box or a vehicle part in an automobile or truck the individual often drives.\n\nThe RFID system does not have to store personal information to have privacy implications. For example, the tag on a bottle of prescription medicine may identify the drug in the bottle, but not the identity of the person for whom the prescription was written. Nonetheless, the individual taking the medicine may still perceive the possession of the drug as personal information if scanned and read by another, as it might reveal information about a medical condition that the individual considers private.\n\nSimilarly, the individual does not have to own a tagged item for the RFID system to have privacy implications. For example, if an employee carries an employer-tagged computer or tools, then RFID technology potentially could be used to track the employee's whereabouts. The employee may agree to be on-call after business hours but could consider his or her location during those times as personal information.",

For example, if an employee carries an employer-tagged computer or tools, then RFID technology potentially could be used to track the employee's whereabouts. The employee may agree to be on-call after business hours but could consider his or her location during those times as personal information.\n\nWhile the concepts of privacy and PII are not new, RFID technology is an example of a technology that introduces new complexity to the landscape of privacy considerations for several reasons. For example, RFID technology increases the likelihood that someone can create PII through indirect means. RFID technology creates opportunities to record, store, and process item-specific information related to business transactions more easily than ever before. In addition, the breadth of items in everyday life that will be incorporated into RFID systems is expected to increase in the coming years. The increase in the coverage of information systems in our daily life combined with the increase of the level of detail of information in those systems will likely create new opportunities for combining data elements to generate PII. Advances in Internet search and data mining software also will facilitate the ability to capture PII from large volumes of what previously might have been considered uncorrelated data. All of these trends can occur even if PII is not recorded on tags themselves.\n\nSeveral inherent features of RFID tags make enforcement of privacy controls more difficult than traditional information technology systems. Organizations may face challenges enforcing privacy policies when they cannot be coupled with effective security controls. RFID uses wireless communication, which is more vulnerable to eavesdropping and other attacks than the wired systems on which most traditional IT systems reside. In many applications, RFID tags will travel between organizations and often will be found in public areas, which means they cannot benefit from physical security commonly provided to most traditional IT systems. In general, RFID computing resources are limited and are not capable of implementing sophisticated technical controls. As this document describes,# Privacy Considerations in RFID Technology",

In general, RFID computing resources are limited and are not capable of implementing sophisticated technical controls. As this document describes,# Privacy Considerations in RFID Technology\n\nMany techniques exist to mitigate these security and privacy risks, and these are expected to improve over time. However, the economics of many RFID applications will require low cost tags with limited functionality, which has significant implications for privacy protections.\n\nFinally, in many applications, especially those involving passive tags, identifiers can live beyond the usefulness of the application for which they were intended, but still may store PII or be used to generate PII when combined with other data. While traditional IT systems have well-established policies and procedures for the retention and destruction of data, destroying or disabling tags may be infeasible once they are outside the control of the organization managing the RFID system.\n\nRFID technology may introduce new privacy considerations that are not fully understood today. Privacy regulation and principles evolve to meet the demands of new IT systems. For instance, technical advances such as the Internet, electronic databases, and analytic system software have made the collection and sharing of PII easier than it was in a world of paper files. RFID technology further extends the reach of IT systems and the collection and sharing of information that might be considered personal.\n\nWhile today RFID readers typically are located in designated locations to support a particular business process, in the future readers may be ubiquitous and capable of supporting multiple objectives. For example, today an RFID system might be implemented to provide access control to a facility using RFID-enabled badges. Badge holders are unlikely to possess other tagged items. In the future, badge holders may routinely carry a number of tagged items, and the badge reader may be used to scan them and create a profile as well as authenticate the badge. The data collected might be shared with third parties for justifiable business needs and with legitimate data sharing agreements.",

The data collected might be shared with third parties for justifiable business needs and with legitimate data sharing agreements.\n\nThe systems might be implemented with disclosure and consent, but may not be effective because individuals and organizations cannot reasonably understand all the potential uses of the data or predict what type of transactions might create PII through indirect inference. For these reasons, new privacy tools and concepts may need to be developed to address the complexity introduced by RFID technology.\n\n## 6.3 Privacy Principles\n\nAn organization's privacy policy is most effective when it is based on principles that reflect a thorough understanding of privacy-related risks. Well-formulated principles lead to a baseline set of privacy requirements that can be further tailored to address organization-specific or application-specific considerations.\n\nIn 1973, the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) (now the Department of Health and Human Services) issued a report entitled *Records, Computers, and the Rights of Citizens*. This report recommended that Congress enact legislation adopting a \"Code of Fair Information Practice\" for automated personal data systems and many of its ideas were eventually incorporated into the Privacy Act of 1974. The HEW Fair Information Practices listed five main privacy objectives:# Privacy Principles and Federal Requirements\n\n## Privacy Principles\n\n- There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret;\n- There must be a way for an individual to find out what information is in his or her file and how the information is being used;\n- There must be a way for an individual to correct information in his or her records;\n- Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of personally identifiable information must assure the reliability of the data for its intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuse; and\n- There must be a way for an individual to prevent personal information obtained for one purpose from being used for another purpose without his or her consent.",
  "## Privacy Principles\n\n- There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret;\n- There must be a way for an individual to find out what information is in his or her file and how the information is being used;\n- There must be a way for an individual to correct information in his or her records;\n- Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of personally identifiable information must assure the reliability of the data for its intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuse; and\n- There must be a way for an individual to prevent personal information obtained for one purpose from being used for another purpose without his or her consent.\n\nIn 1980, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) adopted Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, which provide a framework for privacy policy that has been referenced in US Federal guidance and internationally. Table 6-1 lists the OECD basic principles for privacy and data protection, their definitions, and discusses how each might be addressed in the context of an RFID system.\n\n## Privacy Requirements for Federal Agencies\n\nThis section provides an overview of the following Federal privacy statutes and guidance that pertain to Federal agencies and, in many cases, other organizations that handle, process, or share data with Federal agencies:\n\n- Privacy Act of 1974,\n- Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002,\n- Section 522 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005,\n- Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and\n- OMB memoranda on the implementation of privacy requirements.\n\nThis section is not intended as an interpretation of law, legal advice, or a mandate for any organization. Federal officials responsible for RFID systems should consult with the senior agency official for privacy, legal counsel, and other privacy compliance-related officials to appropriately identify and integrate privacy controls into RFID systems. RFID privacy stakeholders also may include the Office of the Chief Information Officer, the organizational components that the RFID system supports, and the office implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\nCollaboration among RFID project managers and privacy officials will help ensure greater understanding of privacy initiatives currently in place, provide for greater efficiencies in the use and sharing of agency resources, and lower the risk of RFID projects. Additionally, collaboration can better ensure privacy controls are considered early in the system development life cycle and avoid costly retrofitting of solutions.",

Additionally, collaboration can better ensure privacy controls are considered early in the system development life cycle and avoid costly retrofitting of solutions.\n\nWhile Federal agencies must meet certain privacy requirements as a matter of legal compliance, organizations not covered by the mandates may implement privacy controls for other purposes, such as to maintain the trust and confidence of their customers and business partners, or to protect or enhance their reputation. These organizations may still find it useful to review requirements for Federal agencies to determine what might be appropriate for their environment.# 6.4.1 Privacy Act of 1974\n\nFor over 30 years, the cornerstone of federal information privacy law has been the Privacy Act of 1974 (\"the Privacy Act\"), (5 USC \u00a7 552a), which was written before the widespread adoption of IT as the primary means of managing data. The Privacy Act regulates the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of personal information about US citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The Privacy Act applies only to records about individuals maintained by agencies in the executive branch of the government. It also only covers information filed within a system of records, which is a group of files that:\n\n- Contain an individual's name, Social Security Number (SSN), or some other unique personal identifier (such as employee number) AND at least one other element of personal information about the individual (such as date of birth); and\n- Are retrieved by an individual's name, SSN, or personal identifier.\n\n# 6.4.2 E-Government Act of 2002",

The Act contains several provisions likely to apply to RFID systems, including requirements to:\n\n- Perform a privacy impact assessment (PIA),\n- Ensure employees, business partners and contractors are informed and educated of their responsibility to protect PII (if the RFID system manages or generates PII),\n- Evaluate IT system and business model privacy risks for program activities and their information systems, and\n- If the RFID system contains an inter-enterprise subsystem that enables external parties to access RFID information through a Web site, then the RFID system manager may also be required to:\n- Ensure Web site privacy policies and notices adhere to Federal requirements,\n- Comply with Web site tracking technology requirements, and\n- Develop and implement a machine-readable privacy policy plan.\n\nThe Act also requires that agencies designate a point of contact for privacy compliance and related matters. This official should be consulted throughout the life cycle of the RFID system.\n\n# 6.4.3 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)",

The purpose of FISMA is to provide a comprehensive framework for the management of federal information security, including the establishment of a minimum level of controls to protect information and information systems, the improved oversight of agency information security programs, and the use of commercially developed information security products. For the past two years, OMB has required that in addition to the quarterly reporting on compliance with FISMA security requirements, agencies must now report on their privacy compliance posture with federal laws (for instance, the Privacy Act of 1974 and Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002). In Fiscal Year (FY) 2006, OMB's Instructions for Preparing the FISMA and Privacy Management Report prescribed that information and information systems must be categorized and have an appropriate number of security controls and privacy considerations.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\ngiven to each.

The covered entities include all health care providers, insurers, third-party administrators, and the business partners of these entities.\n\nThe privacy rule defines PHI as health information that can be associated with a specific individual. It describes the policies, procedures, and business service agreements required to control the access to and use of PHI. In all but a few circumstances, disclosure of PHI is only permitted if the organization has obtained the individual's consent in advance. The security rule addresses an organization's infrastructure requirements to assure secure and private communication, as well as the confidentiality of patient information.\n\nTo comply with HIPAA, organizations must identify how RFID-enabled business processes create, collect, store, monitor, transmit, or share PHI. In particular, organizations should explore how PHI may be established through indirect means, including scenarios in which information obtained from RFID tags may be combined with other data to infer someone's identity or link it with health information.

Perhaps the greatest HIPAA privacy compliance challenges occur when RFID-tagged medical services and products are delivered or purchased outside the boundaries of hospitals or doctor offices because it is more difficult to enforce controls in these circumstances.\n\n## 6.6 Federal CIO Council Privacy Control Families\nOrganizations may be required to implement privacy controls to comply with the laws and regulations discussed earlier in this section or they may do so voluntarily to protect and improve relationships with customers, business partners, and employees. To assist agencies with their privacy programs, the Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council (\"CIO Council\") developed a reference model that describes 17 privacy control families. Many of the privacy control families are closely related to the security controls discussed in detail in Section 5. How controls within these families will be implemented for RFID systems will vary depending on the characteristics of the business process the RFID system supports. For RFID technology supporting transportation initiatives will likely have a different set of privacy controls than those involving delivery of healthcare. However, both would likely involve privacy controls within the notice and consent family. The control families and related considerations for RFID systems are presented in Table 6-2.",

The Guidelines were created to provide a responsible basis for the use of EPC technology for consumer items. It is anticipated that these principles will continue to evolve with advances in EPCglobal technology and its applications. Additional information on the EPCglobal Guidelines on EPC for Consumer Products and a Frequently Asked Questions document is provided on the EPCglobal Inc Web site at http://www.epcglobalinc.org/public/ppsc_guide/. The Center for Democracy and Technology drafted Privacy Best Practices for Deployment of RFID Technology as a stakeholder response to privacy challenges posed when personally identifiable information is involved.\n\n## 6.8 Summary\nPrivacy considerations are interrelated with security considerations. A key objective of any RFID security program is to identify risks and controls for safeguarding PII. An organization implementing a security and privacy program for an RFID system should consult its privacy officer and legal counsel throughout the information system development life cycle. A privacy program may protect different types of personal information. Some information is personally identifiable, meaning that someone can use it to identify a particular individual. Other information may not be personally identifiable, but individuals may still consider it private even in settings where they are.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",

For example, an individual anonymously traveling on a public bus may not want other passengers to know what items are in her handbag. Information that is not PII typically is not subject to legal requirements, but many people may still consider this information personal and worthy of safeguards. Therefore, organizations may still choose to implement privacy controls voluntarily to safeguard information its customers, business partners, employees, and other stakeholders consider personal.\n\nFederal law governs Federal government agencies' collection and handling of PII. Relevant statutes include the Privacy Act of 1974, the E-Government Act of 2002, FISMA, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005. OMB memoranda provide policy guidance and instructions for agencies' implementation of these laws. The privacy of health information is covered by HIPAA, which applies to non-Federal as well as Federal entities.\n\nThe Federal CIO Council developed a list of privacy control families that provide a reference framework for those integrating privacy principles into RFID systems.

Nevertheless, organizations can benefit from following some general principles when using RFID technology. This section describes a set of recommended security practices that can help organizations manage RFID risks to an acceptable level.\n\nTo be most effective, RFID security controls should be incorporated throughout the entire life cycle \u2013 from policy development to operations. This section references a five-phase life cycle to help organizations determine the most appropriate actions to take at each point in the development of the RFID system. The life cycle is based on a model introduced in NIST Special Publication 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle. Organizations may follow a project management methodology or life cycle model that does not directly map to the phases presented here, but the types of tasks and their sequencing are probably similar. The phases of the life cycle are as follows:\n\n- **Phase 1: Initiation.** This phase covers the tasks that an organization should perform before it starts to design its RFID system. These tasks include conducting a risk assessment and developing policy and requirements with which the RFID system must comply.\n\n- **Phase 2: Acquisition/Development.** For the purposes of this guide, the acquisition/development phase is split into two sub-phases:\n- **Phase 2a: Planning and Design.** In this phase, RFID network architects specify the# RFID System Implementation Phases\n\n## Phase 1: Planning\nStandards with which the RFID system must comply, the network infrastructure that will support the system, and the technical characteristics of the RFID system, including the types of tag and readers that will be deployed.

These tasks include preserving information to meet legal requirements and disabling or destroying tags and other components when they are taken out of service.\n\n# Practices for RFID Security\n\nThe practices presented in this section are provided in tables corresponding to the life cycle phases. Each practice is accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for its inclusion and is rated as \"recommended\" or \"should consider.\" Organizations are strongly encouraged to adopt the \"recommended\" practices. Failure to implement them significantly increases the risk of an RFID security failure. Organizations should also examine each of the \"should consider\" practices to determine their applicability to the target environment.

A \"should consider\" practice should be rejected only if it is infeasible or if the reduction in risk from its implementation does not justify its cost.\n\nOrganizations should develop their RFID security controls based not only on the practices in the tables, but also using other guidelines on security controls. FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, establishes three security categories\u2014low, moderate, and high\u2014based on the potential impact of a security breach involving a particular system. NIST Special Publication 800-53 (as amended), Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, provides minimum management, operational, and technical security controls for information systems based on the FIPS Publication 199 impact categories. The information in NIST Special Publication 800-53 should be helpful to organizations in identifying controls that are needed to protect networks and systems, which should be used in addition to the specific practices for RFID systems listed in this document. Federal agencies should also use NIST Special.# Publication 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems\n\nto evaluate their RFID system and select appropriate security controls.

However, in some cases, the organization may need to modify the existing policies to accommodate the introduction of an RFID system.\n\nSome large organizations may divide RFID-related duties among various teams. For example, one group may be responsible for the RF subsystem, while another might focus on the enterprise subsystem. To assist with this division of labor, the tables in this section identify the affected subsystem or components (e.g., tag or reader) for each of the listed practices. The tables can also serve as checklists. In particular, the status column on the right is blank so that RFID support staff or auditors can use it to measure progress toward implementation of the practices.\n\n## 8. Case Studies\n\nThis section presents two hypothetical case studies to illustrate how RFID security might be implemented in practice. Although the case studies are fictional, they are intended to resemble real-world activities, including how decision makers address common and expected RFID security problems and their solutions. The case studies do not cover all of the aspects of RFID system engineering or operations that an organization may encounter in its RFID implementation, but rather a representative sample of salient issues. The two case studies are as follows:\n\n- Case Study #1: Personnel and asset tracking in a health care environment, and\n- Case Study #2: Supply chain management of hazardous materials.\n\nIn each case study, the fictional organization followed the information system development life cycle introduced in NIST Special Publication 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle, and the practices discussed in Section 7.\n\n### 8.1 Case Study #1: Personnel and Asset Tracking in a Health Care Environment\n\nThe Contagion Research Center (CRC) is a health care facility dedicated to the study of highly contagious diseases\u2014those transmitted through casual human contact. The Center has 40 beds for patient care, a radiology unit with two rooms of sophisticated imaging equipment, and four laboratories with various diagnostic and research capabilities. The Center confronts the same management issues as many hospitals, including locating portable diagnostic equipment when needed and accounting for missing assets. Another important concern is the ability to quickly locate patients and staff as they move about the facility. Poor asset management results in higher costs, reduced efficiency, and lower quality of care.",

Another important concern is the ability to quickly locate patients and staff as they move about the facility. Poor asset management results in higher costs, reduced efficiency, and lower quality of care.\n\nThe mission of the CRC also leads to specialized requirements. To prevent unnecessary outbreaks of disease and to understand how transmission occurs, CRC needs to track the interactions among its staff, patients, and visitors. These tracked interactions provide useful information to researchers about who came into contact with whom and at what time. Additionally, CRC must alert caregivers of disease-specific protocols when they are in close proximity to particular patients, including prohibiting staff contact in some cases. It must track blood, urine, and stool samples from# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nPatient to laboratory. Finally, CRC would like to track the history of in-house diagnostic equipment and trace how the equipment is used to support patients throughout each day. Currently, paper processes are used to achieve these objectives, but they are very labor-intensive and error-prone, sometimes with fatal consequences.\n\nCRC executives tasked the CRC's Chief Information Officer (CIO) to use RFID technology to improve the CRC's traditional asset management function, as well as meet its specialized requirements. Working with the CRC executives, the CIO commissioned a project to reengineer CRC business practices using RFID technology as a primary tool to improve organizational performance.\n\n## 8.1.1 Phase 1: Initiation\n\nThe first step in the project was to conduct a risk assessment to help shape the final scope of the project and identify the most appropriate uses of the RFID technology, as well as potential controls to mitigate the accompanying risk.

Some risks identified during the assessment were as follows:\n\n- RFID systems could open a \"backdoor\" to the CRC computer network, which could result in the compromise of mission-critical systems and research archives.\n- Anyone eavesdropping on RFID transactions could compromise the privacy of patient medical records.\n- The CRC could be held liable for violations of the privacy provisions of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n- The radio frequencies used by the RFID system could interfere with wireless patient sensors and medical telemetry devices, which could impact quality of care and research results.\n- Dermal contact with RFID tags might be a potential vector for the transmission of some highly contagious diseases.\n\nThe risk assessment also concluded that some RFID risks were minimal or nonexistent in the CRC environment. The worst case for expected patient and staff exposure to RF radiation was forecasted to be significantly below any level that might adversely affect their health. CRC already had a well-enforced policy that prohibits the storage of fuel or ordnance at the facility, and the use of potentially explosive material such as ether and oxygen tanks was tightly controlled. The likelihood that an adversary would attempt to use the CRC RFID system to gather intelligence or target personnel was deemed negligible.",

The likelihood that an adversary would attempt to use the CRC RFID system to gather intelligence or target personnel was deemed negligible.\n\nAs a result of the risk assessment, the CRC enhanced its network security policy to require that the RFID system be separated from other network systems using a firewall that permits only required data and management traffic to traverse the network boundary. The network security policy also was amended to require user authentication to all non-stationary RFID readers and encryption of wireless traffic between mobile readers and access points. Existing policy regarding secure server configurations and least privilege data access would extend to the RFID systems without requiring any modifications. The CRC also decided that it would not institute a new requirement for wireless intrusion detection, but it would revisit this decision during the following fiscal year.# The CRC Privacy Assessment and RFID Technology Implementation\n\nThe CRC also conducted a privacy assessment based on information collected during the risk assessment. As a result, the CRC privacy policy was revised to account for the introduction of RFID technology. The revision noted that any patient data collected by the RFID system would be subject to the CRC's internal procedures implementing HIPAA regulations. A final determination was made to update patient release forms to include a statement that inherent risks exist with wireless communications and that network security controls were implemented to help mitigate these risks.\n\nBased on the project charter and the updated security and privacy policies, the CIO led an interdisciplinary team of medical practitioners and information technology professionals to develop the business and functional requirements for the RFID system. These requirements formed the basis for the phases of the project that followed.\n\n## 8.1.2 Phase 2: Acquisition/Development",

These requirements formed the basis for the phases of the project that followed.\n\n## 8.1.2 Phase 2: Acquisition/Development\n\nThe acquisition and design phase of the project involved planning the RFID system. One design decision was to select the tag type for each application. Many of the items to be tracked, including laboratory samples and disposable supplies, were numerous and would be scanned at very close ranges (within 10 centimeters). For these items, passive tags made the most sense, given their low cost. People, high-value assets, and mobile equipment such as carts, gurneys, and wheelchairs needed to be tracked as they moved around the facility. The readable range for these applications needed to be at least a few meters. The team considered active tags, but worried that they could cause interference problems when located in the radiology unit. Accordingly, they selected semi-active tags, which are less likely to emit radiation inadvertently and which have a considerably longer battery life than active tags, but which still have effective operating ranges within CRC's requirements.\n\nThe next step was to plan the location of the stationary readers and the frequencies at which they would operate. In preparation for this exercise, CRC had qualified individuals perform a site survey, which recommended locations for the readers and identified existing spectrum utilization within the facility. They found that patient sensors and medical telemetry devices were operating at low frequencies (125 kHz) and at ultra high frequency ranges (915 MHz). Frequencies throughout and above the radio spectrum were identified in the radiology unit. Based on this information, the design team determined that the passive RFID system would operate in the high frequency range (13.56 MHz), and the semi-active RFID system would operate at microwave frequencies (2.45 GHz).",

Frequencies throughout and above the radio spectrum were identified in the radiology unit. Based on this information, the design team determined that the passive RFID system would operate in the high frequency range (13.56 MHz), and the semi-active RFID system would operate at microwave frequencies (2.45 GHz).\n\nWhile the risk of eavesdropping from locations outside the facility was considered to be very low, the design team still thought it would be of value to mitigate the risk to the greatest extent feasible. Therefore, they ensured that design drawings placed readers away from windows and exterior walls. Preferred locations were over doorways in rooms and on ceiling mounts in hallways. The devices would be prohibited in the radiology unit, but would be placed at entries to the unit. Previously installed shielding in the walls would prevent emissions from impacting the operation of the system.# The Imaging Equipment\n\nInside the unit. The design team determined that stationary readers would be connected to the RFID middleware infrastructure using Ethernet, which is also used to network the desktop computers and servers in the building. To accomplish this, the plan called for the installation of additional network cabling and drops, and use of the existing Ethernet switches, which had considerable excess capacity. Having the RFID systems, desktops, and servers all cabled into the same switches created a risk that the RFID system could be used as a platform to launch an attack on the rest of the network. To mitigate this risk, the design called for a dedicated VLAN to host the RFID-related network hosts. Traffic could only pass from the RFID VLAN to other network segments if it traversed the network firewall required by policy in the initiation phase.\n\nOnce the architecture was completed, the CIO assigned two members of the design team to the job of procuring the system with her review and approval. They paid particular attention to the products' audit and management capabilities. Four vendors provided demonstrations of their products and submitted bids.\n\n## 8.1.3 Phase 3: Implementation",
  "Once the architecture was completed, the CIO assigned two members of the design team to the job of procuring the system with her review and approval. They paid particular attention to the products' audit and management capabilities. Four vendors provided demonstrations of their products and submitted bids.\n\n## 8.1.3 Phase 3: Implementation\n\nThe various components of the system arrived over a three-week period following the procurement effort. The implementation team followed the CRC secure configuration guidelines when building all the servers hosting RFID enterprise software and databases. The implementation team configured all the audit events and alerts on the RFID systems to be directed to a CRC audit server cluster that supports all of the CRC IT infrastructure. They also ran a vulnerability scan on all hosts after the installation to identify remaining weaknesses. Approximately a dozen minor issues were discovered and quickly resolved, mostly through the application of software patches. The last step in preparing the infrastructure was to configure the firewall traffic filters and VLAN architecture specified during the acquisition/development phase.\n\nApplying tags to all the items within the scope of the project was a challenging and time-consuming task. When possible, tags were positioned on items in such a way as to minimize the probability of tampering, destruction, or removal. They were also placed where patients are unlikely to experience dermal or respiratory contact, therefore reducing the probability that a tag's surface could ever be a mechanism for the spread of disease. Tags on patients were embedded in hospital admission wrist bracelets. Tags for staff and hospital personnel were embedded in their hospital identification cards, which are typically worn around the neck on a lanyard or on a retractable leash attached to the belt.\n\n## 8.1.4 Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance\n\nThe operation of the new systems proceeded as expected. CRC experienced a reduction in asset losses resulting from better tracking and some personnel mentioned that the system significantly reduced paperwork. The system also provided benefits to CRC research. In one case, patients in separate rooms.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",

In one case, patients in separate rooms.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## under the supervision of different medical teams contracted a particular illness.\nThese facts initially led the CRC epidemiologists to believe that an airborne pathogen caused the disease. Subsequent analysis of the RFID data showed that a medicine cart handled by several nurses' aides was the likely infection vector by transferring the disease from patient to patient through dermal contact. The operations phase also included the management of the RFID system. Hospital IT personnel received pages when systems were malfunctioning and took corrective actions as necessary. Recently, audit records showing excessive numbers of malformed read transactions led to the detection of an unauthorized radio in the proximity of one of the readers.\n\n### 8.1.5 Phase 5: Disposition\nThe new RFID system has not been in operation long enough to encounter significant disposition issues, but the CRC has instituted procedures for the disposal of RFID tags. The passive tags on disposable items are discarded along with the item. In the case of tags on blood, urine, and stool samples, the tags are disposed as hazardous medical waste. Semi-active tags on patients are disposed of as medical waste upon death or discharge. Data did not need to be removed from the tags prior to disposal because the tags only stored an identifier. Semi-active tags on physical assets are reassigned when the asset is retired. If a tag is malfunctioning, it is physically disabled to ensure inoperability and discarded with office waste.\n\n### 8.1.6 Summary and Evaluation\nThe system involving read-only passive and semi-active tags is helping reduce costs and improve research. Security risks were identified early, and risks were managed to an acceptable level. Table 8-1 presents a summary of how each risk identified in the risk assessment was subsequently addressed.",

Security risks were identified early, and risks were managed to an acceptable level. Table 8-1 presents a summary of how each risk identified in the risk assessment was subsequently addressed.\n\n## 8.2 Case Study #2: Supply Chain Management of Hazardous Materials\nThe Radionuclide Transportation Agency (RTA) oversees the movement of radioactive research materials between production facilities, national laboratories, military installations, and other relevant locations. The RTA oversight of the supply chain for these materials involves many of the same issues as in most any other supply chain. The agency wants to know who is in possession of what quantity of materials at any given time. It also wants to locate materials at a site quickly, without having to search through numerous containers to find them. Bar code technology does not provide that capability.\n\nSome of RTA's requirements are more unique. For instance, much of the transported radionuclide material must be closely monitored because extreme temperatures or excessive vibration can make it useless for its intended applications. Consequently, RTA wants temperature and vibration sensors to continuously measure environmental conditions and record readings on the tag. Additionally, the handling of RTA-regulated materials is a homeland and national security issue. If the materials were to fall into unauthorized hands, they could endanger the public welfare.\n\n### 8.2.1 Phase 1: Initiation\nThe project team began with a risk assessment, which identified a number of concerns, the most# Significant Risks\n\nThe significant risks of which were as follows:\n\n- An adversary could identify and target a vehicle containing RTA-regulated material.\n- An adversary could eavesdrop on tag transactions to learn the characteristics of the material, which could help determine whether it is worth stealing.\n- An adversary could damage or disable a tag, making it easier to steal material without detection.\n- An adversary could alter sensor or manifest data stored on the tag in an effort to undermine the business processes for which the material is being used.\n- The radiation from readers could accidentally cause combustion of collocated volatile materials when several of them are operating concurrently in close proximity.",

The policy further stated that tag-reader communication should be authenticated whenever technically feasible with commercial-off-the-shelf systems. The RTA conducted a privacy assessment that identified that the system would handle PII due to the need to associate materials with particular individuals, although most such information was already contained in existing logs. The agency updated its privacy disclosure statement for employees and contractors to account for the new technology. Finally, it required that all personnel involved in handling of the tagged materials be provided RFID security and privacy awareness training. The agency already had a HERF policy, but everyone agreed the introduction of the RFID system would require the agency to revisit the efficacy of these HERF-related controls.\n\n## 8.2.2 Phase 2: Acquisition/Development\n\nThe acquisition/development phase focused on the planning and design of the RFID system. The nature of the supply chain was such that tagged items would be located at numerous facilities, including future facilities not yet known at the time the design was created. However, some general parameters were known. For instance, readers would need to read tags from distances up to 10 meters, and this capability is typically only found in active tags.",

However, some general parameters were known. For instance, readers would need to read tags from distances up to 10 meters, and this capability is typically only found in active tags.\n\nThe design team spent a significant amount of time on how to mitigate risks associated with the RF link between the readers and the tags. It determined that the risk of eavesdropping and rogue RFID transactions could be within acceptable levels if adversaries were located at least 100 meters from the storage area. The few facilities that could not maintain a perimeter of that distance would rely on bar code technology, which RTA understood would significantly increase labor costs at these sites relative to those using RFID because people would need to be hired to scan items and open containers to inventory their contents.\n\nTo address the requirement of preventing readings during transport, the design team specified mechanisms for shielding containers and vehicles. The shielding would prevent adversaries from determining that items inside a vehicle were tagged, thereby reducing the risk of targeting. In the case of shielded transport vehicles, tags could be read when they were removed from the vehicle at debarkation. Many vehicles were shielded prior to the RFID program to prevent harmful radiation from escaping the.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Vehicle\n\nWhen vehicles were not shielded, tarp-like shielding could be placed around containers within the vehicle and then easily removed when they leave the vehicle. While some users would benefit from the convenience of reading tags from outside the vehicle, the risk this introduced outweighed any potential advantage it offered. Indeed, the primary objectives of the RFID system were to identify the facility at which a radionuclide sample was located and to quickly find items once stored, neither of which necessitated readings when the item was in transport.",

Indeed, the primary objectives of the RFID system were to identify the facility at which a radionuclide sample was located and to quickly find items once stored, neither of which necessitated readings when the item was in transport.\n\nThe tags were also password-protected using a proprietary technology to prevent unauthorized parties from reading or writing to the tags. Because custody of the tags moved from one organization to another, the RTA decided to host a central password database that could be remotely accessed by the RFID middleware of each participating organization. To limit access to the central database to business partners, it was placed on a VPN called RTAnet to which each of the partner organizations connected. The VPN isolates the RFID activity from public networks, thereby making it difficult for an outside adversary to perform a successful attack.\n\nThe team also had to tackle the HERF risk. Although the probability was small that readers would cause combustion of volatile materials stored near radionuclide material, the devastating consequences of its realization still made it a significant concern. The primary mechanism was to use an HF system because it would be less likely to cause combustion than higher frequency UHF and microwave technology. New guidelines also required a separation of five meters between fuel and tagged items unless the volatile materials were shielded.\n\n## 8.2.3 Phase 3: Implementation\n\nThe implementation phase was straightforward, given the extensive planning in the previous phase. The first task was to conduct a pilot test of the system to identify potential problems before they adversely impacted the full supply chain. The test exercise uncovered several interoperability issues with RTAnet devices. In particular, some of the readers did not work properly with the middleware because an undocumented feature conflicted with the settings RTA selected for its equipment. The vendor issued a patch to its software that solved the problem.\n\n## 8.2.4 Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance",

Suppliers and consumers of the regulated materials also decreased their paperwork. They also were able to better match supply of materials with demand for them, since authorized organizations could retrieve information about the quantities present at each site.\n\nThe operations phase also included security monitoring. All participating organizations signed a MOU that covered sharing of information pertaining to possible intrusions or security exploits and proper management of PII. The MOU also included a provision that prohibited participating organizations from using PII for any purpose not explicitly stated in the MOU. This close\n```# Cooperation\n\nEnabled one of the suppliers and a national laboratory to recognize a recurring attack pattern across facilities that might otherwise have been ignored.\n\n## 8.2.5 Phase 5: Disposition\n\nAs a new program, RTA has not actively confronted disposition issues. It plans to instruct participating organizations to retire their RFID systems as they would any other system holding data that RTA deems sensitive. In most cases this involves using disk wiping utilities to delete sensitive files. With regard to tag disposition, RTA's position is that organizations are free to recycle tags so long as they clear sensor and manifest data before affixing a tag to a new item.\n\n## 8.2.6 Summary and Evaluation",

With regard to tag disposition, RTA's position is that organizations are free to recycle tags so long as they clear sensor and manifest data before affixing a tag to a new item.\n\n## 8.2.6 Summary and Evaluation\n\nThe RTA RFID initiative allowed the agency to exercise more effective oversight of the transportation of radionuclide material while also reducing the regulatory compliance cost of impacted organizations. Some important security concerns had been raised, particularly with regards to the possibility that an adversary might use the RFID tags as targeting devices. Early identification of these risks allowed them to be managed during each stage of the systems. A listing of the main risks and the corresponding mitigation approach is presented in Table 8-2."
