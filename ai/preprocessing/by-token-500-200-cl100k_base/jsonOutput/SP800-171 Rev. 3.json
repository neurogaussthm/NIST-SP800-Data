This publication provides federal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations. The requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations. This publication can be used in conjunction with its companion publication, NIST Special Publication 800-171A, which provides a comprehensive set of procedures to assess the security requirements.\n\n# 1. Introduction\nExecutive Order (EO) 13556 [1] established a government-wide program to standardize the way the executive branch handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). EO 13556 required that the CUI program emphasize openness, transparency, and uniformity of government-wide practices and that the program implementation take place in a manner consistent with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and guidelines. As the CUI program Executive Agent, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides information, guidance, policy, and requirements on handling CUI [4]. This includes approved CUI categories and descriptions, the basis for safeguarding and dissemination controls, and procedures for the use of CUI. The CUI federal regulation [5] provides guidance to federal agencies on the designation, safeguarding, marking, dissemination, decontrolling, and disposition of CUI; establishes self-inspection and oversight requirements; and delineates other facets of the program.",
  "The CUI regulation requires federal agencies that use federal information systems to process, store, or transmit CUI to comply with NIST standards and guidelines. The responsibility of federal agencies to protect CUI does not change when such information is shared with nonfederal organizations. Therefore, a similar level of protection is needed when CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted by nonfederal organizations using nonfederal systems. To maintain a consistent level of protection, the security requirements for safeguarding CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations must comply with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 199) publication [6] and FIPS 200 [7]. The requirements are derived from the controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 [8].\n\n## 1.1. Purpose and Applicability\n```# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nThis publication provides federal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI when such information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations and where there are no specific safeguarding requirements prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or government-wide policy for the CUI category listed in the CUI registry [4]. The requirements do not apply to nonfederal organizations that are collecting or maintaining information on behalf of a federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf of an agency. The security requirements in this publication are only applicable to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. The requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements that are established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations. Appropriately scoping requirements is an important factor in determining protection-related investment decisions and managing security risks for nonfederal organizations. If nonfederal organizations designate system components for the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI, those organizations may limit the scope of the security requirements by isolating the system components in a separate security domain. Isolation can be achieved by applying architectural and design concepts (e.g., implementing subnetworks with firewalls or other boundary protection devices and using information flow control mechanisms). Security domains may employ physical separation, logical separation, or a combination of both. This approach can provide adequate security for CUI and avoid increasing the organization's security posture beyond what it requires for protecting its missions, operations, and assets.\n\n## 1.2. Organization of This Publication",
  "## 1.2. Organization of This Publication\n\nThe remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:\n\n- Section 2 describes the assumptions and methodology used to develop the security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI, the format of the requirements, and the tailoring criteria applied to the NIST guidelines to obtain the requirements.\n- Section 3 lists the security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations.\n\nThe following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI:\n\n- References\n- Appendix A: Acronyms\n- Appendix B: Glossary\n- Appendix C: Tailoring Criteria\n- Appendix D: Organization-Defined Parameters\n- Appendix E: Change Log\n\n## 2. The Fundamentals\n\nThis section describes the assumptions and methodology used to develop the requirements to protect the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. It also includes the tailoring criteria applied to the controls in SP 800-53 [8].# 2.1. Security Requirement Assumptions\n\nThe security requirements in this publication are based on the following assumptions:\n\n- Federal information designated as CUI has the same value, whether such information resides in a federal or nonfederal system or organization.\n- Statutory and regulatory requirements for the protection of CUI are consistent in federal and nonfederal systems and organizations.\n- Safeguards implemented to protect CUI are consistent in federal and nonfederal systems and organizations.\n- The confidentiality impact value for CUI is no less than moderate.\n- Nonfederal organizations can directly implement a variety of potential security solutions or use external service providers to satisfy security requirements.\n\n# 2.2. Security Requirement Development Methodology\n\nStarting with the SP 800-53 controls in the SP 800-53B moderate baseline, the controls are tailored to eliminate selected controls or parts of controls that are:\n\n- Primarily the responsibility of the Federal Government,\n- Not directly related to protecting the confidentiality of CUI,\n- Adequately addressed by other related controls, or\n- Not applicable.",

The security requirements are organized into 17 families, as illustrated in Table 1. Each family contains the requirements related to the general security topic of the family. Certain families from SP 800-53 are not included due to the tailoring criteria. For example, the PII Processing and Transparency (PT) family is not included because personally identifiable information (PII) is a category of CUI, and therefore, no additional requirements are specified for confidentiality protection. The Program Management (PM) family is not included because it is not associated with any control baseline. Finally, the Contingency Planning (CP) family is not included because it addresses availability.\n\nOrganization-defined parameters (ODPs) are included in certain security requirements. ODPs provide flexibility through the use of assignment and selection operations to allow federal agencies and nonfederal organizations to specify values for the designated parameters in the requirements. Assignment and selection operations provide the capability to customize the security requirements based on specific protection needs. The determination of ODP values can be guided and informed by laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidance, or mission and business needs. Once specified, the values for the organization-defined parameters become part of the requirement.\n\n## ORGANIZATION-DEFINED PARAMETERS",

ODPs provide both the flexibility and specificity needed by organizations to clearly define their CUI security requirements, given the diverse nature of their missions, business functions, operational environments, and risk tolerance. In addition, ODPs support consistent security assessments in# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Determining Security Requirements\n\nDetermining whether specified security requirements have been satisfied. If a federal agency or a consortium of agencies do not specify a particular value or range of values for an ODP, nonfederal organizations must assign the value or values to complete the security requirement.\n\nA discussion section is included with each requirement. It is derived from the control discussion sections in SP 800-53 and provides additional information to facilitate the implementation and assessment of the requirements. The discussion section is informative, not normative. It is not intended to extend the scope of a requirement or influence the solutions that organizations may use to satisfy a requirement. The use of examples is notional, not exhaustive, and does not reflect the potential options available to organizations. A references section provides the source controls from SP 800-53 and a list of NIST Special Publications with additional information on the topic described in the security requirement. The structure and content of a typical security requirement is provided in the example below.\n\n## 03.13.11 Cryptographic Protection\n\nImplement the following types of cryptography when used to protect the confidentiality of CUI: [Assignment: organization-defined types of cryptography].\n\n### Discussion\n\nCryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.

  "## DISCUSSION\n\nThis requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in 03.01.02. System account types include individual, group, temporary, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, and service. Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by personnel responsible.\n```# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## for approving such accounts and privileged access.\nTypes of accounts that organizations may prohibit due to increased risk include group, emergency, guest, anonymous, and temporary. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on the time of day, day of the week, and point of origin. When defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance) and mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access to facilitate travel requirements).\n\nUsers who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among mission and business owners, system administrators, human resource managers, and legal staff is essential when disabling system accounts for high-risk individuals. Time periods for the notification of organizational personnel or roles may vary.\n\nInactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period.

Types of system access include remote access and access to systems that communicate through external networks, such as the internet. Access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service levels to provide increased protection for CUI. This recognizes that the system can host many applications and services in support of mission and business functions.

Flow control restrictions include keeping CUI from being transmitted in the clear to the internet, blocking external communications traffic that claims to be sourced from within the organization, restricting requests to the internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting CUI transfers between organizations based on data structures and content.\n\nTransferring CUI between organizations may require an agreement that specifies how the information flow is enforced (see 03.12.05). Transferring CUI between systems that represent different security domains with different security policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting CUI transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing information access only), employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.",

Flow control is based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g., encrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that use rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nSource Control: AC-04\nSupporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [11], SP 800-162 [22], SP 800-178 [23]\n\n## 03.01.04 Separation of Duties\n\na.

Non-privileged users do not possess the authorizations to execute privileged functions. Bypassing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users. This requirement represents a condition achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in 03.01.01 and privilege enforcement in 03.01.02. The misuse of privileged functions \u2013 whether intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts \u2013 is a serious and ongoing concern that can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and mitigate risks from advanced persistent threats and insider threats.\n\n## REFERENCES\nSource Controls: AC-06(09), AC-06(10)\nSupporting Publications: None\n\n### 03.01.08 Unsuccessful Logon Attempts\na.

A privileged command is a human-initiated command executed on a system that involves the control, monitoring, or administration of the system, including security functions and security-relevant information. Security-relevant information is information that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of code and data.

Establishing usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for wireless access to the system provides criteria to support access authorization decisions. These restrictions and requirements reduce susceptibility to unauthorized system access through wireless technologies. Wireless networks use authentication protocols that provide credential protection and mutual authentication. Organizations authenticate individuals and devices to protect wireless access to the system. Special attention is given to the variety of devices with potential wireless access to the system, including small form factor mobile devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets, smart watches). Wireless networking capabilities that are embedded within system components represent a potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. Strong authentication of users and devices, strong encryption, and disabling wireless capabilities that are not needed for essential mission or business functions can reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.\n\n### References\n\n- Source Controls: AC-18, AC-18(01), AC-18(03)\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-94 [29], SP 800-97 [30], SP 800-124 [28]\n\n## 03.01.17 Withdrawn\n\nIncorporated into 03.01.16.\n\n## 03.01.18 Access Control for Mobile Devices",

Mobile device functionality may include on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, voice communication capabilities, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, smart watches, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capabilities of mobile devices may be comparable to or a subset of notebook or desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Some organizations may consider notebook computers to be mobile devices. The protection and control of mobile devices are behavior- or policy-based and require users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which the organization provides physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting CUI. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementing mandatory protective software.# Scanning Devices for Malicious Code",
  "Updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting operating system and possibly other software integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.

These systems include personally owned systems, system components, or devices; privately owned computing and communication devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; and systems managed by contractors. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or specified types of external systems (e.g., prohibit the use of external systems that are not organizationally owned). Terms and conditions are consistent with the trust relationships established with the entities that own, operate, or maintain external systems and include descriptions of shared responsibilities. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to the organizational system and over whom organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals may vary depending on the trust relationships between organizations. Organizations need assurance that external systems satisfy the necessary security requirements so as not to compromise, damage, or harm the system.

Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined events].# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nAn event is any observable occurrence in a system, including unlawful or unauthorized system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed. This includes events that are relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can include password changes, the execution of privileged functions, failed logons or accesses related to systems, administrative privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging, organizations consider the system monitoring and auditing that are appropriate for each of the security requirements. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related events, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented or cloud-based architectures.\n\nMonitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file access \u2013 both successful and unsuccessful \u2013 but only activate that capability under specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. The event types that are logged by organizations may change over time. Reviewing and updating the set of logged event types are necessary to ensure that the current set of event types remains relevant.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nSource Control: AU-02\nSupporting Publications: SP 800-92 [35]\n\n## 03.03.02 Audit Record Content\n\na.

Implement an audit record reduction and report generation capability that supports audit record review, analysis, reporting requirements, and after-the-fact investigations of incidents.\nb. Preserve the original content and time ordering of audit records.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAudit records are generated in 03.03.03. Audit record reduction and report generation occur after audit record generation. Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes it in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit record reduction and report generation capabilities do not always come from the same system or organizational entities that conduct auditing activities. An audit record reduction capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the system can help generate customizable reports. The time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the time stamp in the record is insufficient.\n\n## References\n\n- Source Control: AU-07\n- Supporting Publications: None\n\n# 03.03.07 Time Stamps\n\na.

Time is often expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) \u2013 a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) \u2013 or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within hundreds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time granularities for system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities (e.g., access control and identification and authentication), depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.# REFERENCES\n\n## Source Control: AU-08\n### Supporting Publications: None\n\n### 03.03.08 Protection of Audit Information\na. Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.\nb. Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to only a subset of privileged users or roles.\n\n## DISCUSSION\nAudit information includes the information needed to successfully audit system activity, such as audit records, audit log settings, audit reports, and personally identifiable information. Audit logging tools are programs and devices used to conduct audit and logging activities. The protection of audit information focuses on technical protection and limits the ability to access and execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. The physical protection of audit information is addressed by media and physical protection requirements. Individuals or roles with privileged access to a system and who are also the subject of an audit by that system may affect the reliability of the audit information by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. Requiring privileged access to be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges limits the number of users or roles with audit-related privileges.\n\n## REFERENCES\n### Source Controls: AU-09, AU-09(04)\n### Supporting Publications: None\n\n### 03.03.09 Withdrawn\nIncorporated into 03.03.08.\n\n## 3.4.

Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon specifications for the system or configuration items within the system. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to the system and include information about system components, operational procedures, network topology, and the placement of components in the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as the system changes over time. Baseline configurations of the system reflect the current enterprise architecture.\n\n## REFERENCES\n### Source Control: CM-02\n### Supporting Publications: SP 800-124 [28], SP 800-128 [41], IR 8011-2 [42], IR 8011-3 [43]\n\n### 03.04.02 Configuration Settings\na.

Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for the system. The established settings become part of the system's configuration baseline.\n\nCommon secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, and security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations, including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- Source Control: CM-06\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-70 [44], SP 800-126 [45], SP 800-128 [41]\n\n## 03.04.03 Configuration Change Control\n\na.

Some functions and services that are routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. It may be convenient to provide multiple services from single system components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible,# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Organizations Limit Functionality\n\nOrganizations limit functionality to a single function per component. Organizations review the functions and services provided by the system or system components to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent the unauthorized connection of devices, the transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and endpoint protection systems (e.g., firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems) to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, system connections, and services. Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and peer-to-peer networking are examples of the types of protocols that organizations consider eliminating, restricting, or disabling.\n\n### References\n\n- Source Controls: CM-07, CM-07(01)\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [11], SP 800-167 [46]\n\n## 03.04.07 Withdrawn\n\nIncorporated into 03.04.06 and 03.04.08.\n\n## 03.04.08 Authorized Software \u2013 Allow by Exception",

Organizations can implement protective measures on the systems or system components used by individuals departing on and returning from travel. Actions include determining whether the locations are of concern, defining the required configurations for the components, ensuring that the components are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and taking additional actions after travel is completed. For example, systems going into high-risk areas can be configured with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and more stringent configuration settings. Actions applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include examining the device for signs of physical tampering and purging and reimaging the device storage.\n\n## References\n- Source Control: CM-02(07)\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-124 [28], SP 800-128 [41]\n\n# 3.5.

Since system processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require the unique identification of individuals in group accounts or the accountability of individual activity. The unique identification and authentication of users apply to all system accesses. Organizations use passwords, physical authenticators, biometrics, or some combination thereof to authenticate user identities. Organizations may reauthenticate individuals in certain situations, including when roles, authenticators, or credentials change; when the execution of privileged functions occurs; after a fixed time period; or periodically.\n\n### REFERENCES\n- Source Controls: IA-02, IA-11\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-63-3 [27]\n\n## 03.05.02 Device Identification and Authentication\nUniquely identify and authenticate [Assignment: organization-defined devices or types of devices] before establishing a system connection.\n\n### DISCUSSION\nDevices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication are defined by type, device, or a combination of type and device.

Enforce the following composition and complexity rules for passwords: [Assignment: organization-defined composition and complexity rules].# DISCUSSION\n\nPassword-based authentication applies to passwords used in single-factor or multifactor authentication. Long passwords or passphrases are preferable to shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However, organizations may choose to establish and enforce certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum character length) under certain circumstances. For example, account recovery can occur when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof. Changing temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon ensures that the necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the earliest opportunity and reduces susceptibility to authenticator compromises. Long passwords and passphrases can be used to increase the complexity of passwords.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- Source Control: IA-05(01)\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-63-3 [27]\n- 03.05.08 Withdrawn\n- Consistency with SP 800-53 [8].\n- 03.05.09 Withdrawn\n- Consistency with SP 800-53 [8].\n- 03.05.10 Withdrawn\n- Incorporated into 03.05.07.\n- 03.05.11 Authentication Feedback\n- Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process.",

For example, for desktop or notebook systems with relatively large monitors, the threat may be significant (commonly referred to as shoulder surfing). For mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood of input errors due to small keyboards. Therefore, the means of obscuring authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a limited time before fully obscuring it.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- Source Control: IA-06\n- Supporting Publications: None\n- 03.05.12 Authenticator Management\na.

  "# DISCUSSION# Authenticators\n\nAuthenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics, certificates, one-time password devices, and ID badges. The initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast, requirements for authenticator content contain specific characteristics.\n\nAuthenticator management is supported by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., password complexity and composition rules, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and the number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication). The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented by 03.15.03 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by 03.01.01, 03.01.02, 03.01.05, and 03.13.08 for authenticators stored in organizational systems. This includes passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats or files that contain hashed or encrypted passwords that are accessible with administrator privileges. Actions can be taken to protect authenticators, including maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators with others, and immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators.\n\nDevelopers may deliver system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well-known, easily discoverable, and present a significant risk. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking authenticators for temporary access when they are no longer needed. The use of long passwords or passphrases may obviate the need to periodically change authenticators.\n\n## References\n\n- Source Control: IA-05\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-63-3 [27]\n\n# 3.6.

Organizations can use technical and non-technical measures (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control the use of system media. For example, organizations may control the use of portable storage devices by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read, or write to.# Devices\n\nOrganizations may limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Organizations may also control the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device\u2014prohibiting the use of writable, portable devices\u2014and implement this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Limits on the use of organization-controlled system media in external systems include restrictions on how the media may be used and under what conditions. Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for removable system media reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to assign responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the media (e.g., insertion of malicious code).\n\n## References\n\n- Source Control: MP-07\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-111 [51]\n\n----\n\n## 03.08.08 Withdrawn\n\nIncorporated into 03.08.07.\n\n## 03.08.09 System Backup \u2014 Cryptographic Protection\n\na.

Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities. Examples of physical access monitoring include guards, video surveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor devices. Reviewing physical access logs can help to identify suspicious activities, anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be supported by audit logging controls if the access logs are part of an automated system. Incident response capabilities include investigations of physical security incidents and responses to those incidents. Incidents include security violations or suspicious physical access activities, such as access outside of normal work hours, repeated access to areas not normally accessed, access for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence access.\n\n### REFERENCES\nSource Control: PE-06\nSupporting Publications: None\n\n## 03.10.03 Withdrawn\nIncorporated into 03.10.07.\n\n## 03.10.04 Withdrawn\nIncorporated into 03.10.07.\n\n## 03.10.05 Withdrawn\nIncorporated into 03.10.07.\n\n## 03.10.06 Alternate Work Site\na.

Organizations determine the types of guards needed, including professional security staff or administrative staff. Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, biometric readers, and card readers. Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural, automated, or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include exterior access points, interior access points to systems that require supplemental access controls, or both. Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with permanent physical access authorizations are not considered visitors. Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing output devices in locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or card reader access controls and only allowing access to authorized individuals, placing output devices in locations that can be monitored by personnel, installing monitor or screen filters, and using headphones. Examples of output devices include monitors, printers, scanners, facsimile machines, audio devices, and copiers.\n\n## REFERENCES\nSource Controls: PE-03, PE-05\nSupporting Publications: None\n\n## 03.10.08 Access Control for Transmission\nControl physical access to system distribution and transmission lines within organizational facilities.",

Vulnerability analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, or binary analysis. Organizations can use these approaches in source code reviews and tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating flow control mechanisms. To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention. Sources for vulnerability information also include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).\n\n### References\n- Source Controls: RA-05, RA-05(02)\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-40 [56], SP 800-53A [57], SP 800-70 [44], SP 800-115 [58], SP 800-126 [45]\n\n## 03.11.03 Withdrawn\n\nIncorporated into 03.11.02.\n\n## 03.11.04 Risk Response\n\nRespond to findings from security assessments, monitoring, and audits.\n\n### Discussion",

Block malicious code, quarantine malicious code, or take other mitigation actions in response to malicious code detection.\n\n#### DISCUSSION\nMalicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Malicious code can be inserted into the system in a variety of ways, including email, the internet, and portable storage devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats, contained in compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software and custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions. Periodic scans of the system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed can detect malicious code. Malicious code protection mechanisms can also monitor systems for anomalous or unexpected behaviors and take appropriate actions. Malicious code protection mechanisms include signature- and non-signature-based technologies. Non-signature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective.\n\nMalicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates).

Pervasive configuration management, anti-exploitation software, and software integrity controls may also be effective in preventing unauthorized code execution.",

Non-signature-based mechanisms include reputation-based technologies. Pervasive configuration management, anti-exploitation software, and software integrity controls may also be effective in preventing unauthorized code execution.\n\nIf malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations can rely on secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that the software only performs intended functions. Organizations may determine that different actions are warranted in response to the detection of malicious code. For example, organizations can define actions to be taken in response to the detection of malicious code during scans, malicious downloads, or malicious activity when attempting to open or execute files.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- Source Control: SI-03\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-83 [76], SP 800-125B [65], SP 800-177 [70]\n\n## 03.14.03 Security Alerts, Advisories, and Directives\n\na.

The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) generate security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the Federal Government and in nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription services, and industry Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) may also provide security alerts and advisories.

Internal monitoring# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Monitoring\n\nIncludes the observation of events that occur within the system. External monitoring includes the observation of events that occur at the system boundary. Organizations can monitor the system by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects, such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events.\n\nA system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., audit record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms that support critical applications with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives.\n\nSystems connections can be network, remote, or local. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, the internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device that communicates through an external network (e.g., the internet). Network, remote, and local connections can be either wired or wireless.\n\nUnusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in the system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information, or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify a potentially compromised system. System monitoring requirements, including the need for types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements.\n\n### REFERENCES",

System security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and the subsequent determinations of risk if the plan is implemented as intended. System security plans can be a collection of documents, including documents that already exist. Effective system security plans reference policies, procedures, and documents (e.g., design specifications) that provide additional detailed information. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security information in other established management or operational areas related to enterprise architecture, the system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition.\n\n## REFERENCES\n**Source Control:** PL-02\n**Supporting Publications:** SP 800-18 [63]\n\n## 03.15.03 Rules of Behavior\na.

For legacy systems, organizations apply systems security engineering principles to system modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components. The application of systems security engineering principles helps to develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduce the susceptibility of organizations to disruptions, hazards, and threats.\n\nExamples include developing layered protections; establishing security policies, architectures, and controls as the foundation for system design; incorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build trustworthy secure software; and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk.

An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in opportunities for adversaries to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies in the installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business capabilities when newer technologies are unavailable or when the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.\n\nAlternative sources of support address the need to provide continued support for system components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors when such components remain essential to organizational missions and business functions. If necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for critical software components or obtain the services of external service providers who provide ongoing support for.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Unsupported Components\n\nUnsupported components through contractual relationships.

Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services remains with the organization charged with protecting CUI. Service-level agreements define expectations of performance, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies, mitigations, and response requirements for instances of noncompliance. Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions, ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when there is a need to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services or blocking certain ports and protocols. This requirement is related to 03.01.20.\n\n### References\n- Source Control: SA-09\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [11], SP 800-161 [33]\n\n## 3.17.

There are many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end use of a system or system component, using blind purchases, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, the insertion of counterfeits, the insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices throughout the system life cycle.\n\nOrganizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers to implement safeguards, promote transparency in their processes and security practices, provide contract language that addresses the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for personnel regarding supply chain risks, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation, and evidence are commensurate with the security requirements of the organization. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.\n\n## References\n- Source Control: SR-05\n- Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [55], SP 800-161 [33]",

Establish a process for identifying and addressing weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes.\nb. Enforce the following security requirements to protect against supply chain risks to the system, system components, or system services and to limit the harm or consequences from supply chain-related events: [Assignment: organization-defined]# SECURITY REQUIREMENTS\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nSupply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools that are employed for the research, development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes include hardware, software, firmware, and systems development processes; shipping and handling procedures; physical security programs; personnel security programs; configuration management tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain elements and processes are provided by organizations, system integrators, or external service providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to harm the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or business functions.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\nSource Control: SR-03\nSupporting Publications: SP 800-30 [55], SP 800-161 [33]"
