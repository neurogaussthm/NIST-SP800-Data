Configuration management concepts and principles described in this publication provide supporting information for NIST SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. NIST SP 800-128 assumes that information security is an integral part of an organization's overall configuration management. The focus of this document is on implementation of the information system security aspects of configuration management, and as such the term security-focused configuration management (SecCM) is used to emphasize the concentration on information security. In addition to the fundamental concepts associated with SecCM, the process of applying SecCM practices to information systems is described. The goal of SecCM activities is to manage and monitor the configurations of information systems to achieve adequate security and minimize organizational risk while supporting the desired business functionality and services.\n\n# CHAPTER ONE\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n### THE NEED FOR CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TO PROTECT INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS\n\nA system is composed of many components that can be interconnected in a multitude of arrangements to meet a variety of business, mission, and information security needs. How system components are networked, configured, and managed is critical in providing adequate information security and supporting an organization's risk management process. A system is typically in a constant state of change in response to new, enhanced, corrected, or updated hardware and software capabilities, patches for correcting software flaws and other errors to existing components, new security threats, changing business functions, etc. Implementing system changes almost always results in some adjustment to the system configuration. To ensure that the required adjustments to the system configuration do not adversely affect the security of the system or the organization from operation of the system, a well-defined configuration management process that integrates information security is needed.\n\nOrganizations apply configuration management (CM) for establishing baselines and for tracking, controlling, and managing many aspects of business development and operation (e.g., products, services, manufacturing, business processes, and information technology). Organizations with a robust and effective CM process need to consider information security implications with respect to the development and operation of systems including hardware, software, applications, and documentation. Effective CM of systems requires the integration of the management of secure configurations into the organizational CM process or processes. For this reason, this document assumes that information security is an integral part.\n```# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",

Though both IT business application functions and security-focused practices are expected to be integrated as a single process, SecCM in this context is defined as the management and control of configurations for systems to enable security and facilitate the management of information security risk.\n\n## 1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY\n\nFederal agencies are responsible for \"including policies and procedures that ensure compliance with minimally acceptable system configuration requirements, as determined by the agency\" within their information security program. Managing system configurations is also a minimum security requirement identified in [FIPS 200], and NIST [SP 800-53] defines controls that support this requirement.\n\nIn addition to general guidelines for ensuring that security considerations are integrated into the CM process, this publication provides guidelines for implementation of the Configuration Management family of controls defined in NIST [SP 800-53] (CM-1 through CM-9). This publication also includes guidelines for NIST [SP 800-53] controls related to managing the configuration of the system architecture and associated components for secure processing, storing, and transmitting of information. Configuration management is an important process for establishing and maintaining secure system configurations, and provides important support for managing security risks in systems.",

The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to complement similar guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems with the approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.\n\nThis publication is intended to provide guidelines for organizations responsible for managing and administrating the security of federal information systems and associated environments of operation.

Some basic terms associated with the configuration management discipline are briefly explained below.# Configuration Management (CM)\n\nConfiguration Management (CM) comprises a collection of activities focused on establishing and maintaining the integrity of products and systems, through control of the processes for initializing, changing, and monitoring the configurations of those products and systems.\n\n## Configuration Item (CI)\n\nA Configuration Item (CI) is an identifiable part of a system (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, documentation, or a combination thereof) that is a discrete target of configuration control processes.\n\n## Baseline Configuration\n\nA Baseline Configuration is a set of specifications for a system, or CI within a system, that has been formally reviewed and agreed on at a given point in time, and which can be changed only through change control procedures. The baseline configuration is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes.\n\n## Configuration Management Plan (CM Plan)\n\nA Configuration Management Plan (CM Plan) is a comprehensive description of the roles, responsibilities, policies, and procedures that apply when managing the configuration of products and systems. The basic parts of a CM Plan include:\n\n- **Configuration Control Board (CCB)** \u2013 Establishment of and charter for a group of qualified people with responsibility for the process of controlling and approving changes throughout the development and operational lifecycle of products and systems; may also be referred to as a change control board;\n\n- **Configuration Item Identification** \u2013 Methodology for selecting and naming configuration items that need to be placed under CM;",

The configuration of a system is a representation of the system's components, how each component is configured, and how the components are connected or arranged to implement the system. The possible conditions in which a system or system component can be arranged affect the security posture of the system. The activities involved in managing the configuration of a system include development of a configuration management plan, establishment of a configuration control board, development of a methodology for configuration item identification, establishment of the baseline configuration, development of a configuration change control process, and development of a process for configuration monitoring and reporting.\n\n## 2.1.2 The Challenge of Protecting Information and Managing Risk\n\nAs the ubiquity of information technology increases the dependence on systems, organizations are faced with an increase in the number and severity of threats that can have# Adverse Impacts on Operations, Assets, and Individuals",

The cornerstone of any effort to manage organizational risk related to systems is an effective security program.\n\nIt is incumbent upon the organization to implement its directives in a manner that provides adequate security for protecting information and systems. As threats continue to evolve in an environment where organizations have finite resources with which to protect themselves, security has become a risk-based activity where the operational and economic costs of ensuring that a particular threat does not exploit a vulnerability are balanced against the needs of the organization's mission and business processes. In a world of limited resources, the practice of risk management is fundamental to an information security program.\n\n## Risk-Based Mission Protection Strategies\n\nIn risk-based mission protection strategies, organizations explicitly identify and respond to risks associated with the use of systems in carrying out missions and business processes. Careful consideration is given to how a range of diverse threats can expose existing vulnerabilities and cause harm to the organization. In the management of risk, organizations often have very little control over threats. Organizations cannot control earthquakes, floods, disgruntled employees, hackers, and other threats; however, organizations can control vulnerabilities and reduce threats via implementation of a robust SecCM process that is part of the overall risk management process.",

In the management of risk, organizations often have very little control over threats. Organizations cannot control earthquakes, floods, disgruntled employees, hackers, and other threats; however, organizations can control vulnerabilities and reduce threats via implementation of a robust SecCM process that is part of the overall risk management process.\n\nVulnerabilities represent the various types of weaknesses that can be exploited by a threat. While an analysis of system vulnerabilities reveals a variety of potential causes, many vulnerabilities can be traced to software flaws and misconfigurations of system components. The management of configurations has traditionally been viewed as an IT management best practice. Using SecCM to gain greater control over and ensure the integrity of IT resources facilitates asset management, improves incident response, help desk, disaster recovery and problem solving, aids in software development and release management, enables greater automation of processes, and supports compliance with policies and preparation for audits.\n\n### Role of Security-Focused Configuration Management\n\nThe configuration of a system and its components has a direct impact on the security posture of the system. How the configurations are established and maintained requires a disciplined approach for providing adequate security. Changes to the configuration of a system are often needed to stay up to date with changing business functions and services, and information security needs. However, changes can adversely impact the previously established security posture.# Security-Focused Configuration Management\n\nTherefore, effective configuration management is vital to the establishment and maintenance of security of information and systems. The security-focused configuration management process is critical to maintaining a secure state under normal operations, contingency recovery operations, and reconstitution to normal operations.\n\n## What is Security-Focused Configuration Management (SecCM)?\n\nSecurity-Focused Configuration Management (SecCM) is the management and control of secure configurations for a system to enable security and facilitate the management of risk. SecCM builds on the general concepts, processes, and activities of configuration management by paying attention to the implementation and maintenance of the established security requirements of the organization and systems.\n\n## Integration with Existing Processes\n\nInformation security configuration management requirements are integrated into (or complement) existing organizational configuration management processes (e.g., business functions, applications, products) and information systems.

SecCM builds on the general concepts, processes, and activities of configuration management by paying attention to the implementation and maintenance of the established security requirements of the organization and systems.\n\n## Integration with Existing Processes\n\nInformation security configuration management requirements are integrated into (or complement) existing organizational configuration management processes (e.g., business functions, applications, products) and information systems. SecCM activities include:\n\n- Identification and recording of configurations that impact the security posture of the system and the organization;\n- The consideration of security risks in approving the initial configuration;\n- The analysis of security implications of changes to the system configuration; and\n- Documentation of the approved/implemented changes.\n\n## Implementation of SecCM\n\nIn cases where an organization has no existing CM process in place, security-focused configuration management practices as defined in this document are developed and implemented from process inception.\n\nInitial implementation of a SecCM program may require considerable effort. If there is no existing SecCM process within the organization, there is an initial investment in developing and implementing a program that is comprehensive enough to span multiple technologies, the organizational structure, and disparate processes, and that can deliver consistent results while supporting the organization's missions and business processes. In addition, tools are procured and implemented, system components inventoried and recorded, and processes modified to account for new ways of managing technology in the context of SecCM.\n\n## Ongoing Investment in SecCM",

In addition, tools are procured and implemented, system components inventoried and recorded, and processes modified to account for new ways of managing technology in the context of SecCM.\n\n## Ongoing Investment in SecCM\n\nOnce in place, SecCM requires an ongoing investment in time and resources. Product patches, fixes, and updates require time for security impact analysis even as threats and vulnerabilities continue to exist. As changes to systems are made, baseline configurations are updated, specific configuration settings confirmed, and configuration items tracked, verified, and reported. SecCM is a continuous activity that, once incorporated into IT management processes, touches all stages of the system development life cycle (SDLC). Organizations that implement SecCM throughout the SDLC and make its tenets a part of the IT management culture are most likely to reap benefits in terms of improvement of security and functionality, and more effective management of organizational risk.\n\n## 2.2 The Phases of Security-Focused Configuration Management# Security-focused Configuration Management\n\nSecurity-focused configuration management of systems involves a set of activities that can be organized into four major phases: Planning; Identifying and Implementing Configurations; Controlling Configuration Changes; and Monitoring. It is through these phases that SecCM not only supports security for a system and its components, but also supports the management of organizational risk. Chapter 3 presents the detailed processes and considerations in implementing the necessary activities in each of these phases.\n\nThe four phases of SecCM are illustrated in Figure 2-1 and described below.\n\n## 2.2.1 PLANNING",

Chapter 3 presents the detailed processes and considerations in implementing the necessary activities in each of these phases.\n\nThe four phases of SecCM are illustrated in Figure 2-1 and described below.\n\n## 2.2.1 PLANNING\n\nAs with many security activities, planning can greatly impact the success or failure of the effort. As a part of planning, the scope or applicability of SecCM processes are identified. Planning includes developing policy and procedures to incorporate SecCM into existing information technology and security programs, and then disseminating the policy throughout the organization. Policy addresses areas such as the implementation of SecCM plans, integration into existing security program plans, Configuration Control Boards (CCBs), configuration change control processes, tools and technology, the use of common secure configurations and baseline configurations, monitoring, and metrics for compliance with established SecCM policy and procedures. It is typically more cost-effective to develop and implement a SecCM plan, policies, procedures, and associated SecCM tools at the organizational or mission/business process risk management level.\n\n## 2.2.2 IDENTIFYING AND IMPLEMENTING CONFIGURATIONS\n\nAfter the planning and preparation activities are completed, a secure baseline configuration for the system is developed, reviewed, approved, and implemented. The approved baseline configuration for a system and associated components represents the most secure state consistent with operational requirements and constraints. For a typical system, the secure baseline may address configuration settings, software loads, patch levels, how the information system is physically or logically arranged, how various security controls are implemented, and documentation. Where possible, automation is used to enable interoperability of tools and uniformity of baseline configurations across the system.\n\n## 2.2.3 CONTROLLING CONFIGURATION CHANGES",

Where possible, automation is used to enable interoperability of tools and uniformity of baseline configurations across the system.\n\n## 2.2.3 CONTROLLING CONFIGURATION CHANGES\n\nGiven the continually evolving nature of a system and the mission it supports, the challenge for organizations is not only to establish an initial baseline configuration that represents a secure state (which is also cost-effective, functional, and supportive of mission and business processes), but also to maintain a secure configuration in the face of the significant waves of change that ripple through organizations.\n\nIn this phase of SecCM, the emphasis is put on the management of change to maintain the secure, approved baseline of the system. Through the use of SecCM practices, organizations ensure that# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Changes\n\nChanges are formally identified, proposed, reviewed, analyzed for security impact, tested, and approved prior to implementation. As part of the configuration change control effort, organizations can employ a variety of access restrictions for change including access controls, process automation, abstract layers, change windows, and verification and audit activities to limit unauthorized and/or undocumented changes to the system.\n\n## 2.2.4 Monitoring\n\nMonitoring activities are used as the mechanism within SecCM to validate that the system is adhering to organizational policies, procedures, and the approved secure baseline configuration. Planning and implementing secure configurations and then controlling configuration change is usually not sufficient to ensure that a system which was once secure will remain secure. Monitoring identifies undiscovered/undocumented system components, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized changes, all of which, if not addressed, can expose organizations to increased risk. Using automated tools helps organizations to efficiently identify when the system is not consistent with the approved baseline configuration and when remediation actions are necessary. In addition, the use of automated tools often facilitates situational awareness and the documentation of deviations from the baseline configuration.",

Using automated tools helps organizations to efficiently identify when the system is not consistent with the approved baseline configuration and when remediation actions are necessary. In addition, the use of automated tools often facilitates situational awareness and the documentation of deviations from the baseline configuration.\n\nProcesses and requirements within all four SecCM phases do not remain static thus all processes in all four phases are reviewed and revised as needed to support organizational risk management. SecCM monitoring activities may loop back to any of the previous phases (as noted in Figure 2-1) and precipitate changes.\n\nSecCM monitoring is done through assessment and reporting activities. Reports address the secure state of individual system configurations and are used as input to Risk Management Framework information security continuous monitoring requirements. SecCM monitoring can also support gathering of information for metrics that can be used to provide quantitative evidence that the SecCM program is meeting its stated goals, and can be used to improve SecCM processes in general.\n\n## 2.3 Security-Focused Configuration Management Concepts\n\nThis section describes the fundamental concepts relevant to the practice of SecCM within an organization. Recognizing that organizations have widely varying missions and organizational structures, there may be differences in the way that SecCM is implemented and managed.\n\n### 2.3.1 Configuration Management Policy and Procedures\n\nThe development of documented SecCM policy communicates senior management's expectations for SecCM to members of the organization through specific, measurable, and confirmable objectives. It is a top-down approach which defines what is required and what is not permitted with respect to using SecCM to manage and control information resources. While policy defines the objectives for what must be done, procedures describe how the policy.# Configuration Management",

SecCM procedures are developed to describe the methodology and tasks for each activity that supports implementation of the SecCM policy.

The SecCM Plan may be written to apply to an entire organization, or it may be localized and tailored to a system or a group of systems supporting a mission/business process within the organization. The SecCM Plan may take the form of an all-inclusive, stand-alone document that describes all aspects of SecCM or may be contained within more broadly defined CM procedures. A SecCM Plan may also take the form of a set of documents and appendices that taken together describe all aspects of SecCM. Finally, the SecCM Plan may take the form of a set of predefined data elements in a repository. The SecCM Plan is produced during the Planning phase and supports the implementation of NIST [SP 800-53] controls CM-1 Configuration Management Policy and Procedures and CM-9 Configuration Management Plan.",

The group, which represents various perspectives from within the organization, is chosen to evaluate and approve changes to the system. The CCB is a check and balance on configuration change activity, assuring that changes are held to organizationally defined criteria (e.g., scope, cost, impact on security) before being implemented. The CCB may be less formal for systems which have limited size, scope, and criticality in the context of the mission of the organization. The organization determines the size and formality of the CCB that is appropriate for a given system (or systems) within the organization. The CCB establishment is part of the Planning phase of SecCM and supports the implementation of NIST [SP 800-53] control CM-3 Configuration Change Control.\n\n## 2.3.4 Component Inventory\nThe component inventory is a descriptive record of the components within an organization down to the system level.

The CI is identified, labeled, and tracked during its life cycle \u2013 the CI is the target of many of the activities within SecCM, such as configuration change control and monitoring activities. A CI may be a specific system component (e.g., server, workstation, router, application), a group of system components (e.g., group of servers with like operating systems, group of network components such as routers and switches, an application or suite of applications), a non-component object (e.g., firmware, documentation), or a system as a whole. CIs give organizations a way to decompose the system into manageable parts whose configurations can be actively managed. The purpose of breaking up a system into CIs is to allow more granularity and control in managing the secure configuration of the system. The level of granularity varies among organizations and systems and is balanced against the associated management overhead for each CI. In one organization, it may be appropriate to create a single CI to track all of the laptops within a system, while in another organization, each laptop may represent an individual CI. Identification of the configuration items that compose a system is part of the Planning phase of SecCM and supports the implementation of NIST [SP 800-53] control CM-3 Configuration Change Control.\n\n## 2.3.6 SECURE CONFIGURATIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS",
  "## 2.3.6 SECURE CONFIGURATIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS\n\nConfigurations represent the possible states in which a system and its components can be arranged. Secure configurations are designed to reduce the organizational security risk from operation of a system, and may involve using trusted or approved software loads, maintaining up-to-date patch levels, applying secure configuration settings of the IT products used, and implementation of endpoint protection platforms. Secure configurations for a system are most often achieved through the application of secure configuration settings to the IT products (e.g., operating systems, databases, etc.) used to build the system. For example, a secure configuration for selected IT products used within the system or organization could incorporate the principle of\n```# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n## Least Functionality\nLeast functionality helps to minimize the potential for introduction of security vulnerabilities and includes, but is not limited to, disabling or uninstalling unused/unnecessary operating system (OS) functionality, protocols, ports, and services, and limiting the software that can be installed and the functionality of that software. Implementing secure configurations is part of the Identifying and Implementing Configurations phase of SecCM and supports the implementation of NIST [SP 800-53] controls CM-6 Configuration Settings and CM-7 Least Functionality.\n\n## 2.3.7 Baseline Configuration\nA baseline configuration is a set of specifications for a system, or Configuration Item (CI) within a system, that has been formally reviewed and agreed on at a given point in time, and which can be changed only through change control procedures. The baseline configuration is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes.\n\nThe baseline configuration of a system may evolve over time depending on the stage of the system development life cycle (SDLC). Early in the SDLC when a system is being initiated and acquired, the baseline may be a set of functional requirements. As the system is developed and implemented, the baseline may expand to include additional configuration items such as the technical design, the software load, the architecture, and configurations of the system and its individual components. A baseline configuration may also represent different information computing environments such as development, test, and production.\n\nWhen a new baseline configuration is established, the implication is that all of the changes from the last baseline have been approved. Older versions of approved baseline configurations are maintained and made available for review or rollback as needed.",

Configuration change control for the system involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, test/evaluation, review, and disposition of changes to the system, including upgrades and modifications.\n\nConfiguration change control is applied to include changes to components of the system, changes to the configuration settings for information technology products, emergency/unscheduled changes, and changes to remediate flaws. Changes are controlled from the time the change is proposed to the implementation and testing of the change. Each step in the change process is clearly articulated along with the responsibilities and authorities of the roles involved.\n\nConfiguration change control falls under the Controlling Configuration Changes phase of SecCM and supports the implementation of NIST [SP 800-53] control CM-3 Configuration Change.# Control and CM-5 Access Restrictions for Change\n\n## 2.3.9 SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS\n\nSecurity impact analysis is the analysis conducted by qualified staff within an organization to determine the extent to which changes to the system affect the security posture of the system. Because systems are typically in a constant state of change, it is important to understand the impact of changes on the functionality of existing security controls and in the context of organizational risk tolerance.

Security impact analysis is incorporated into the documented configuration change control process.\n\nThe analysis of the security impact of a change occurs when changes are analyzed and evaluated for adverse impact on security, preferably before they are approved and implemented, but also in the case of emergency/unscheduled changes. Once the changes are implemented and tested, a security impact analysis (and/or assessment) is performed to ensure that the changes have been implemented as approved, and to determine if there are any unanticipated effects of the change on existing security controls.\n\nSecurity impact analysis is performed as a part of the Controlling Configuration Changes phase of SecCM and supports the implementation of NIST [SP 800-53] control CM-4 Security Impact Analysis.\n\n## 2.3.10 CONFIGURATION MONITORING\n\nConfiguration monitoring involves activities to determine whether systems are configured in accordance with the organization's agreed-upon baseline configurations, and whether the components identified within the system are consistent with the component inventory being maintained by the organization.\n\nConfiguration monitoring helps to ensure that SecCM controls are operating as intended and are providing effective security while supporting adherence to SecCM policies and procedures. Configuration monitoring may also help to motivate staff members to perform SecCM activities in accordance with policies and procedures. Additionally, configuration monitoring supports organizations in their efforts to conform to the Risk Management Framework.\n\nInformation gathered during configuration monitoring can be used to support overall continuous monitoring activities including ongoing assessments of specific controls and updates to documentation such as System Security Plans, Security Assessment Reports, and Security Status Reports. Automation capabilities, such as those defined by SCAP, can be used to automate assessment activities.\n\nConfiguration monitoring is part of the Monitoring phase of SecCM and supports the implementation of all NIST [SP 800-53] controls in the CM Family.\n\n## 2.4 SECCM ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES",

Some of the activities may be more efficiently performed at the organizational or mission/business process level (i.e., applying to more than one information system), while other activities may be more efficiently performed at the system level (i.e., applying to a single system). Each organization determines what activities are conducted at the organizational or mission/business process level and what activities are conducted at the system level in accordance with organizational management requirements.

The subsections are listed in the order in which the planning activities typically occur. As always, organizations have flexibility in determining which activities are performed at what level and in what order.

An organization-wide SecCM program also demonstrates management commitment for the effort. This commitment from the top of the organization is communicated throughout the organization down to the individual system owners.\n\nThe SecCM program manager facilitates communications regarding SecCM policies, procedures, issues, etc., within the organization. Consideration is given to implementation of a security information management console or \"dashboard\" to communicate basic project and operational information to stakeholders in language they understand. The SecCM program manager also considers other vehicles for communication such as Web site updates, emails, and newsletters to share milestones, measures of value, and other SecCM-related news with stakeholders.\n\n### Primary Roles\n- SecCM Program Manager\n\n### Supporting Roles\n- SAISO (if s/he is not the SecCM Program Manager)\n- CIO\n- AO\n\n### Expected Input\n- Organizational risk tolerance\n- Organizational security requirements\n- Applicable laws, regulations, policies, etc. from higher authorities\n\n### Expected Output\n- Functional organization-wide SecCM program\n\n## Develop Organizational SecCM Policy\nThe organization is typically responsible for defining documented policies for the SecCM program.

A schedule for SecCM monitoring and associated reporting is established as part of the strategy. Scheduled and ad hoc assessments are included within the strategy. The monitoring schedule may coincide with scheduled releases such that assessments are performed before and after deployments. Ad hoc assessments may also be conducted so that staff does not become lax in between scheduled assessments. Additionally, the schedule includes provisions for reviewing and revising the SecCM monitoring strategy to ensure that the strategy continues to meet organizational security requirements.\n\nSee Section 3.4 for more information on SecCM monitoring.\n\n## Primary Roles\n- SecCM Program Manager\n\n## Supporting Roles\n- SAISO or equivalent (if s/he is not the SecCM Program Manager)\n- System Owner\n- SSO\n\n## Expected Input\n- SecCM policy and procedures\n- Overall organizational continuous monitoring policy and procedures\n- Organizational risk tolerance\n- Organizational security requirements\n\n## Expected Output\n- Strategy and schedule for configuration monitoring and reporting\n\n# Define the Types of Changes That Do Not Require Configuration Change Control",

When possible, organizations look for automated solutions which, in the long run, can lower costs, enhance efficiency, and improve the reliability of SecCM efforts.\n\nIn most cases, tools to support activities in SecCM phases two, three, and four are selected for use across the organization by SecCM program management, and system owners are responsible for applying the tools to the SecCM activities performed on each system. Similarly, tools and mechanisms for inventory reporting and management may be provided to system owners by the organization. In accordance with federal government and organizational policy, if automated tools are used, the tools are Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)-validated to the extent that such tools are available. SCAP is described in more detail in Section 3.5.\n\nIf not provided by the organization, tools are identified and deployed to support SecCM at the system level. When possible, existing SecCM tools from within the organization are leveraged to support consistent organization-wide SecCM practices, centralized reporting, and cost efficiency. Leveraging existing tools may require them to be installed and configured to function on individual systems. Tool installation and configuration usually requires that accounts be set up, administrators identified, schedules determined, the appropriate baseline.# Configurations Set Up\n\nand possibly installation of a client on each component to be configuration-controlled. If the tool has already been deployed within the organization, instructions for installation, configuration, and deployment are available or easy to produce if needed.\n\nThere are a wide variety of configuration management tools available to support an organization's SecCM program. At a minimum, the organization considers tools that can automatically assess configuration settings of system components. To the greatest extent possible, select automated tools that can scan different system components (e.g., Web server, database server, network devices, etc.) running different operating systems, identify the current configuration settings, and indicate where the current settings are noncompliant with policy.",

The subsections are listed in the order in which the planning activities typically occur. As always, organizations have flexibility in determining which activities are performed at the organizational level and which activities are performed at the system level, and in what order. The system-level planning phase results in a completed SecCM Plan, an established Configuration Control Board, an accurate system component inventory, and defined configuration items for the system.\n\n## Develop SecCM Plan for Information System\nThe primary goal of the SecCM Plan is to document or provide references to system-specific SecCM-related information. The organization may define a master SecCM Plan and provide templates that require a subset of the SecCM Plan to be documented for each system, or the system owner may be required to define the system SecCM Plan in its entirety.

An accurate component inventory is essential to record the components that compose the system. The component inventory helps to improve the security of the system by providing a comprehensive view of the components that need to be managed and secured. All system components are tracked from acquisition to retirement as part of the organization's SDLC process.\n\nThe system component inventory can be represented as:\n```\nSystem Component Inventory = {SC1, SC2, \u2026 SCn},\n```\nwhere n is greater than or equal to one, and SC represents a system component within the organization.\n\nEvery organizational component is included within the authorization boundary of one, and only one, system and is documented and tracked in an inventory which reflects the association with the# System Component Inventory Management\n\nA component associated with a system is included in that system component inventory. A component may support systems that are not within the same authorization boundary (i.e., such as a server that supports several Web applications or virtual machines); however, the owners of the supported systems have neither authority over, nor responsibility for, the supporting component, and thus the component would not be included in the component inventories of the supported systems.\n\n## Discovery Process",

Discovery, which may be manual or automated, is the process of obtaining information on system components that compose the systems within the organization. The organization typically determines the types and granularity of the components (peripherals versus workstations, routers, etc.) that are to be identified within the inventory.\n\nIn most organizations, it is impractical to manually collect this information for inclusion in the inventory or for analysis against the authorized inventory. The use of automated tools for discovery, analysis, and management of component inventories is generally a more effective and efficient means of maintaining component inventories.\n\nStill, it is important to note that even with automated inventory management tools, it may still be necessary to enter some component inventory data elements manually. Examples include, but are not limited to, organizational unique identifiers, system association (depending on network configuration, whether the inventory management tool installation is at the organizational level or system level, etc.), system/component owner, administrator, or user, configuration item association, or type of component.\n\n## Inventory Management Tools\n\nTools that support inventory management are usually database-driven applications to track and manage system components within a given environment. Once an inventory is established, automated tools are often used to detect the removal or addition of components. Some inventory management tools allow for expanded monitoring of components through the use of built-in hooks in the OS, installation of agents on each component, or Application Programming Interfaces. With this functionality, the inventory management system can monitor changes in the component's configuration and report the results to specified staff.",

CIs may be one or a group of system components, documents, network diagrams, scripts, custom code, and various other elements that compose the system and which require configuration management. A system can be represented as a set of one or more CIs as follows:\n\nSystem = {CI1, CI2, \u2026CIn} where n is greater than or equal to 1.\n\nThere is a one-to-many relationship between systems and CIs. Thus, each system is composed of one or more CIs and each CI is part of one, and only one, system.

System applications (e.g., software applications) may be represented as one or more CIs (also as in representation i). All documentation for the system may be included in one CI or each document may be treated as a separate CI (as in representation ii). Conversely, the system owner may find that it is more expedient to include the servers, applications running on the servers, and supporting documentation in a single CI (as in representation iii). When applying representations i or ii, it is important to note that the rigor of the review and approval of change proposals for one CI (e.g., a CI composed of servers) may be higher than that applied to another CI (e.g., a CI composed of documentation).

The CCB is established through the creation of a charter which defines the authority and scope of the group and how it should operate. A charter may define the CCB's membership, the roles and responsibilities of its members, and whether it reports to an oversight body like an Executive Steering Committee or the Risk Executive (Function). A charter also describes the process by which the CCB operates, including how to handle changes and the range of...# Dispositions and Evaluation Criteria\n\nDispositions (approved, not approved, on hold, etc.), evaluation criteria, and the quorum required to make configuration change control-related decisions.\n\n## Role of the CCB\n\nThe CCB plays an important role of gatekeeper in deciding which changes may be acted upon and introduced into a system.

Low-impact and/or small, uncomplicated systems may require less formality such that the CCB may be composed of as few as two members (typically the system owner and the SSO). For high-impact systems and complex moderate-impact systems, the organization may require a CCB that is composed of at least three individuals, at least one of whom is a system owner or SSO.\n\nAdditionally, the organization may determine that it is necessary to formally submit proposed changes to the CCB and go through formalized reviews and security impact analysis prior to acceptance and approval.\n\n## Best Practices for Configuration Change Control\n\nRegardless of the size and formalism of the CCB for a system, best practices for configuration change control require that changes to the system be vetted by at least one authorized individual who is independent of the requestor\u2014in other words, in order to maintain adequate separation of duties, system administrators, developers, etc., are not given the authority to unilaterally propose and approve changes to the configuration of a system (excluding changes identified in procedures as being exempt from SecCM).

The viewpoints and expertise of individuals representing the organizational and/or system mission, information security (system security officers, security architects, etc.), information technology (e.g., system administrators, network engineers, enterprise architects, etc.), end users, customers, vendors, etc., are considered for inclusion in the CCB.

Secure configurations may include:\n\n- Setting secure values (i.e., the parameters that describe how particular automated functions of IT products behave) including, but not limited to:\n- OS and application features (enabling or disabling depending on the specific feature, setting specific parameters, etc.);\n- Services (e.g., automatic updates) and ports (e.g., DNS over port 53);\n- Network protocols (e.g., NetBIOS, IPv6) and network interfaces (e.g., Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, infrared);\n- Methods of remote access (e.g., SSL, VPN, SSH, IPSEC);\n- Access controls (e.g., controlling permissions to files, directories, registry keys, and restricting user activities such as modifying system logs or installing applications);\n- Management of identifiers/accounts (e.g., changing default account names, determining length of time until inactive accounts are disabled, using unique user names, establishing user groups);\n- Authentication controls (e.g., password length, use of special characters, minimum password age, multifactor authentication/use of tokens);\n- Audit settings (e.g., capturing key events such as failures, logons, permission changes, unsuccessful file access, creation of users and objects, deletion and modification of system files, registry key and kernel changes);\n- System settings (e.g., session timeouts, number of remote connections, session lock); and\n- Cryptography (e.g., using [FIPS 140-3]-validated cryptographic protocols and# Algorithms to Protect Data in Transit and in Storage",
  "- Applying vendor-released patches in response to identified vulnerabilities, including software updates;\n- Using approved, signed software, if supported;\n- Implementing safeguards through software to protect end-user machines against attack (e.g., antivirus, antispyware, anti-adware, personal firewalls, host-based intrusion detection systems);\n- Applying network protections (e.g., TLS, IPSEC);\n- Establishing the location where a component physically and logically resides (e.g., behind a firewall, within a DMZ, on a specific subnet, etc.); and\n- Maintaining and updating technical specification and design documentation, system security documentation, system procedures, etc.\n\nIn many cases, organizational policies, in accordance with federal laws, standards, directives, and orders, establish generally accepted common secure configurations (e.g., National Checklist Program, DISA STIGs, CIS benchmarks). Configurations identified in the National Checklist Program Repository as well as SCAP-expressed checklists are a source for establishing common secure configurations. Commercial product developers are also a potential source for common secure configurations. Deviations from common secure configurations are justified and recorded (see Section 3.2.2.iii).\n\nIn establishing and maintaining secure configurations, organizations consider potential interoperability conflicts with interconnected systems. Coordination of secure configuration baselines between system staff and/or the relevant CCB(s) helps ensure synchronization of secure configurations between interconnected systems to meet desired security and operational functionality.\n\nIf not identified in organizational policies and procedures, the system owner, in coordination with the SSO, has the responsibility of establishing secure configurations (based on appropriate common secure configurations, if available) for a system and its constituent CIs.

There are many IT products, and each has a myriad of possible parameters that can be configured.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nIn addition, organizations have mission and business process needs which may require that IT products be configured in a particular manner. To further complicate matters, for some products, the configuration settings of the underlying platform may need to be modified to allow for the functionality required for mission accomplishment such that they deviate from the approved common secure configurations.\n\nUsing the secure configuration previously established (see Section 3.2.1) as a starting point, the following structured approach is recommended when implementing the secure configuration:\n\n## i. Prioritize Configurations\n\nIn the ideal environment, all IT products within an organization would be configured to the most secure state that still provided the functionality required by the organization. However, due to limited resources and other constraints, many organizations may find it necessary to prioritize which systems, IT products, or CIs to target first for secure configuration as they implement SecCM.\n\nIn determining the priorities for implementing secure configurations in systems, IT products, or CIs, organizations consider the following criteria:\n\n- **System impact level**\nImplementing secure configurations in systems with a high or moderate security impact level may have priority over systems with a low security impact level.\n\n- **Risk assessments**\nRisk assessments can be used to target systems, IT products, or CIs having the most impact on security and organizational risk.",

For example, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a specification within SCAP that provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics of software flaw vulnerabilities and in calculating their relative severity. CVSS scores can be used to help prioritize configuration and patching activities.\n\n- **Degree of penetration**\nThe degree of penetration represents the extent to which the same product is deployed within an information technology environment. For example, if an organization uses a specific operating system on 95 percent of its workstations, it may obtain the most immediate value by planning and deploying secure configurations for that operating system. Other IT products or CIs can be targeted afterwards.\n\n## ii. Test Configurations\n\nOrganizations fully test secure configurations prior to implementation in the production environment. There are a number of issues that may be encountered when implementing configurations including software compatibility and hardware device driver issues. For example, there may be legacy applications with special operating requirements that do not function correctly after a common secure configuration has been applied. Additionally, configuration errors could occur if Operating System (OS) and multiple application configurations are applied to the same component. For example, a setting for an application# Configuration Management",

Virtual environments are recommended for testing secure configurations as they allow organizations to examine the functional impact on applications without having to configure actual machines.\n\n## Resolve Issues and Document Deviations\nTesting secure configuration implementations may introduce functional problems within the system or applications. For example, the new secure configuration may close a port or stop a service that is needed for OS or application functionality. These problems are examined individually and either resolved or documented as a deviation from, or exception to, the established common secure configurations.\n\nIn some cases, changing one configuration setting may require changes to another setting, another CI, or another system. For instance, a common secure configuration may specify strengthened password requirements which may require a change to existing single sign-on applications. Or there may be a requirement that the OS-provided firewall be enabled by default. To ensure that applications function as expected, the firewall policy may need to be revised to allow specific ports, services, IP addresses, etc. When conflicts between applications and secure configurations cannot be resolved, deviations are documented and approved through the configuration change control process as appropriate.",

Once recorded, the preliminary baseline configuration is approved in accordance with organizationally defined policy. Once approved, the preliminary baseline configuration becomes the initial baseline configuration for the system and its constituent CIs.\n\nThe baseline configuration of a system includes the sum total of the secure configurations of its constituent CIs and represents the system-specific configuration against which all changes are controlled.\n\nThe baseline configuration may include, as applicable, information regarding the system architecture, the interconnection of hardware components, secure configuration settings of software components, the software load, supporting documentation, and the elements in a release package. There could be a different baseline configuration for each life cycle stage (development, test, staging, production) of the system.\n\nWhen possible, organizations employ automated tools to support the management of baseline configurations and to keep the configuration information as up to date and near real time as possible.

The following subsections are listed in the order in which the configuration activities typically occur. As always, organizations have flexibility in determining which activities are performed at what level and in what order. Completion of the Controlling Configuration Changes phase results in implementation of access restrictions for change, and documented configuration change control and security impact analysis processes.\n\n### 3.3.1 Implement Access Restrictions for Change\n\nAccess restrictions for change represent the enforcement side of SecCM. Configuration change control is a process for funneling changes for a system through a managed process; however, without access restrictions, there is nothing preventing someone from implementing changes outside of the process. Access restrictions are a mechanism to enforce configuration control processes by controlling who has access to the system and/or its constituent CIs to make changes. Access restrictions for change may also include controlling access to additional change-related information such as change requests, records, correspondence, change test plans.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nand results, etc.\n\n## To implement access restrictions for change:\ni.

Configuration change control is the process for ensuring that configuration changes to a system are formally requested, evaluated for their security impact, tested for effectiveness, and approved before the changes are implemented. Although the process may have different steps and levels of rigor depending on organizational risk tolerance and/or system-impact level, configuration change control generally consists of the following steps:",

Although the process may have different steps and levels of rigor depending on organizational risk tolerance and/or system-impact level, configuration change control generally consists of the following steps:\n\ni. Request the change. A request for change may originate from any number of sources including the end user of the system, a help desk, or from management. Proposed changes may also originate from vendor-supplied patches, application updates, security alerts, system scans, etc. See Appendix E for a Sample Change Request Template.\nii. Record the request for the proposed change. A change request is formally entered into the configuration change control process when it is recorded in accordance with organizational procedures. Organizations may use paper-based requests, emails, a help desk, and/or automated tools to track change requests, route them based on workflow processes, and allow for electronic acknowledgements/approvals.\niii. Determine if the proposed change requires configuration control. Some types of changes may be exempt from configuration change control or pre-approved as defined in the SecCM plan and/or procedures. If the change is exempt or pre-approved, note this on the change request and allow the change to be made without further analysis or approval; however, system documentation may still require updating (e.g., the System Security Plan, the baseline configuration, system component inventory, etc.).\niv. Analyze the proposed change for its security impact on the system (see Section 3.3.3).\nv. Test the proposed change for security and functional impacts. Testing confirms the impacts identified during analysis and/or reveals additional impacts. The impacts of the change are presented to the CCB and to the AO.\n``````markdown\n## vi. Approve the change.",
  "This step is usually performed by the CCB. The CCB may require the implementation of additional controls if the change is necessary for mission accomplishment but has a negative impact on the security of the system and organization. Implementation of additional controls is coordinated with the AO and System Owner.\n\n## vii. Implement the approved change.\n\nOnce approved, authorized staff makes the change. Depending upon the scope of the change, it may be helpful to develop an implementation plan. Change implementation includes changes to applicable/related configuration parameters as well as updating system documentation to reflect the change(s). Stakeholders (e.g., users, management, help desk, etc.) are notified about the change, especially if the change implementation requires a service interruption or alters the functionality of the system. In the case of the latter situation, user and help desk training may be required.\n\n## viii. Verify that the change was implemented correctly\n\n(e.g., vulnerability scans, post-implementation security and functionality analysis, reassessment of affected security controls, etc.). Configuration change control is not complete and a change request not closed until it has been confirmed that the change was deployed without issues. Although the initial security impact analysis and testing may have found no impact from the change, an improperly implemented change can cause its own security issues.\n\n## ix. Close out the change request.\n\nWith completion of the above steps, the change request is closed out in accordance with organizational procedures. Changes are also evaluated for consistency with organizational enterprise architecture. If configuration change control procedures have been defined by the organization, the system owner interprets the procedures in the context of the target system, and refines the process to make it practical to perform. Changes to the process may need to be approved by the organizational CCB in accordance with SecCM policy.\n\nIt is important that IT operations and maintenance staff who support the system are active participants in the configuration change control process and are aware of their responsibility for following it. If significant business process reengineering is needed, for example, updating help desk activities or a patch management process, training may be required.\n\n## Unscheduled or Unauthorized Changes",

If configuration change control procedures have been defined by the organization, the system owner interprets the procedures in the context of the target system, and refines the process to make it practical to perform. Changes to the process may need to be approved by the organizational CCB in accordance with SecCM policy.\n\nIt is important that IT operations and maintenance staff who support the system are active participants in the configuration change control process and are aware of their responsibility for following it. If significant business process reengineering is needed, for example, updating help desk activities or a patch management process, training may be required.\n\n## Unscheduled or Unauthorized Changes\n\nUnfortunately, it is not uncommon to see activities such as deploying or disposing of hardware, making changes to configurations, and installing patches occurring outside the configuration change control process even though such activities can have a significant impact on the security of a system. Additionally, situations may arise that necessitate an unscheduled (emergency) change. It is incumbent upon system owners to identify all sources of change to make certain that changes requiring configuration control go through the configuration change control process, even if it is after the fact.\n\nWhen unscheduled changes must be made and time does not allow for following the\n``````markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Established\n\nConfiguration change control process, unscheduled changes are still managed and controlled.

Organizations spend significant resources developing and maintaining the secure state of systems; failing to properly analyze a change for its security impact can undo the system security effort and expose the organization to attack. The security impact analysis activity provides the linkage between configuration change control and improved security. The management of changes through a structured process has its own benefits \u2013 for instance, increased efficiency. However, it is only when those changes are evaluated for their security impact that the configuration change control process realizes benefits for the security posture of a system.\n\nVery large organizations or system owners of large and complex systems may find it helpful to create a Configuration Review Board to manage and conduct security impact analyses and report the findings to the relevant CCB. Changes are examined for impact on security, and for mitigating controls that can be implemented to reduce any resulting vulnerability. Security impact analyses are conducted by individuals or teams with technical knowledge of the system throughout the SDLC such that the impact of changes on security is considered at every phase:\n\n- **Initiation Phase (Before a Change is Deployed)**\nSecurity impact analysis before a change is deployed is critical in ascertaining whether the change will impact the secure state of the system. The initial security impact analysis is conducted before the change is approved by the CCB. If there are security concerns with a change, they can be addressed/mitigated before time and energy are spent in building, testing, and/or rolling out the change.",

When the change is initially proposed and reviewed, the manner in which the change will be built and implemented may not be known, something which can greatly influence the security impact of the change. For instance, for a custom-built component during the design phase, security impact analysis is performed on technical design documents to ensure that the design considers security best practices, implements the appropriate controls, and would not need to be redeveloped at a later date due to introduced vulnerabilities. Developers ensure that security is taken into account as they build the component, and the design is tested during implementation to confirm that expected controls were implemented and that no new or unexpected vulnerabilities were introduced.\n\n## Operations and Maintenance Phase (After a Change is Deployed)\n\nSecurity impact analysis in the operations and maintenance phase confirms that the original security impact analysis was correct, and that unexpected vulnerabilities or impacts to security controls not identified in the testing environment have not been introduced in the operational environment. Additionally, the security impact of unscheduled and unauthorized changes is analyzed during the operations and maintenance phase.\n\nThe process for a security impact analysis consists of the following steps:",
  "## Operations and Maintenance Phase (After a Change is Deployed)\n\nSecurity impact analysis in the operations and maintenance phase confirms that the original security impact analysis was correct, and that unexpected vulnerabilities or impacts to security controls not identified in the testing environment have not been introduced in the operational environment. Additionally, the security impact of unscheduled and unauthorized changes is analyzed during the operations and maintenance phase.\n\nThe process for a security impact analysis consists of the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Change** - If the change is being proposed, develop a high-level architecture overview which shows how the change will be implemented. If the change has already occurred (unscheduled/unauthorized), request follow-up documentation/information and review it or use whatever information is available (e.g., audit records, interview staff who made the change, etc.) to gain insight into the change.\n\n2. **Identify Vulnerabilities** - If the change involves a COTS hardware or software product, identifying vulnerabilities may include, but is not limited to, a search of the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) which enumerates vulnerabilities, user experience, etc. Organizations can leverage NVD information to address known issues and remove or mitigate them before they become a concern. Other public databases of vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and threats may also be searched (e.g., US-CERT). Some automated vulnerability scanning tools (SCAP-validated tools where possible) are able to search various public vulnerability databases that apply to IT products/CPE names of IT products. If the change involves custom development, a more in-depth analysis of the security impact is conducted. Although application security is beyond the scope of this publication, there are many best practices and useful sources of information for how to ensure the security of software code.\n\n3. **Assess Risks** - Once a vulnerability has been identified, a risk assessment is needed to identify the likelihood of a threat exercising the vulnerability and the impact of such an event. Although vulnerabilities may be identified in changes as they are proposed, built,# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nand tested, the assessed risk may be low enough that the risk can be accepted without remediation (i.e., risk acceptance). In other cases, the risk may be high enough that the change is not approved (i.e., risk avoidance), or that safeguards and countermeasures are implemented to reduce the risk (i.e., risk mitigation).\n\n## iv. Assess Impact on Existing Security Controls",

In other cases, the risk may be high enough that the change is not approved (i.e., risk avoidance), or that safeguards and countermeasures are implemented to reduce the risk (i.e., risk mitigation).\n\n## iv. Assess Impact on Existing Security Controls\n\nIn addition to assessing the risk from the change, organizations analyze whether and how a change will impact existing security controls. For example, the change may involve installation of software that alters the existing baseline configuration, or the change itself may cause or require changes to the existing baseline configuration. The change may also affect other systems or system components that depend on the function or component being changed, either temporarily or permanently. For example, if a database that is used to support auditing controls is being upgraded to the latest version, auditing functionality within the system may be halted while the upgrade is being implemented.\n\n## v. Plan Safeguards and Countermeasures\n\nIn cases where risks have been identified and are unacceptable, organizations use the security impact analysis to revise the change or to plan safeguards and countermeasures to reduce the risk. For instance, if the security impact analysis reveals that the proposed change causes a modification to a common secure configuration setting, plans to rework the change to function within the existing setting are initiated. If a change involves new elevated privileges for users, plans to mitigate the additional risk are made (e.g., submission of requests for higher clearance levels for those users or implementation of stronger access controls).\n\nSee Appendix I for a sample Security Impact Analysis Template.\n\n## SDLC Phase: Operations and Maintenance phase\n\n**Primary Roles:** SSO\n**Supporting Roles:** AO; System Owner; SA; System/Software Developer\n**Expected Input:** Change request and/or any supporting documentation; System Security Plan including the current approved baseline configuration; system audit records; relevant COTS vulnerability information\n**Expected Output:** Identified vulnerabilities; risk assessment of identified vulnerabilities including any potential countermeasures; analysis of the security impact of the change\n\n## 3.3.4 RECORD AND ARCHIVE",

Monitoring activities offer the organization better visibility into the actual state of security for its systems and also support adherence to SecCM policies and procedures. SecCM monitoring also provides input to the organization's overall continuous monitoring strategy.\n\nOrganizations implement the configuration monitoring strategy developed during the SecCM planning phase. SecCM monitoring activities confirm that the existing configuration is identical to the current approved baseline configuration, that all items in the component inventory can be identified and are associated with the appropriate system, and, if possible, whether there are any unapproved (i.e., not recorded in the component inventory) components. Unapproved components often create a major security risk; unapproved components rarely have updated patches, are not configured using the approved baseline configurations, and are not assessed or included in the authorization to operate. For example, if a technician uses a router for testing and then forgets to remove it, or if an employee sets up a wireless access point in a remote office without management consent, the organization may be vulnerable without being aware of it.",

For organizations with a large number of components, the only practical and effective solution for SecCM monitoring activities is the use of automated solutions that use standardized reporting methods such as SCAP. A system may have many components and many baseline configurations. To manually collect information on the configuration of all components and...# Assessing Security Configuration Management (SecCM)\n\nAssessing them against policy and approved baseline configurations is not practical, or even possible, in most cases. Automated tools can also facilitate reporting for Security Information and Event Management applications that can be accessed by management and/or formatted into other reports on baseline configuration status in support of overall continuous monitoring. Care is exercised in collecting and analyzing the results generated by automated tools to account for any false positives.\n\n## SecCM Monitoring Methods\n\nSecCM monitoring may be supported by numerous means, including, but not limited to:\n\n- **Scanning to discover components not recorded in the inventory.** For example, after testing of a new firewall, a technician forgets to remove it from the network. If it is not properly configured, it may provide access to the network for intruders. A scan would identify this network device as not a part of the inventory, enabling the organization to take action.",

A scan would identify a difference between the actual environment and the description in the baseline configuration enabling the organization to take action. In another example, a new tool is installed on the workstations of a few end users of the system. During installation, the tool changes a number of configuration settings in the browser on the users' workstations, exposing them to attack. A scan would identify the change in the workstation configuration, allowing the appropriate individuals to take action.\n\n- **Implementation of automated change monitoring tools** (e.g., change/configuration management tools, application whitelisting tools). Unauthorized changes to systems may be an indication that the systems are under attack or that SecCM procedures are not being followed or need updating. Automated tools are available that monitor systems for changes and alert system staff if unauthorized changes occur or are attempted.\n\n- **Querying audit records/log monitoring to identify unauthorized change events.**\n\n- **Running system integrity checks to verify that baseline configurations have not been changed.**\n\n- **Reviewing configuration change control records** (including security impact analyses) to verify conformance with SecCM policy and procedures.",

Action taken may be via manual methods or via use of automated tools. Automated tools are preferable since actions are not reliant upon human intervention and are taken immediately once an unauthorized change is identified. Examples of possible actions include:\n\n- Implementing nondestructive remediation actions (e.g., quarantining of unregistered device(s), blocking insecure protocols, etc.);\n- Sending an alert with change details to appropriate staff using email;\n- Rolling back changes and restoring from backups;\n- Updating the inventory to include newly identified components; and\n- Updating baseline configurations to represent new configurations.\n\nChanges detected as a result of monitoring activities are reconciled with approved changes. Specifically, reconciliation attempts to answer the following:\n\n- Who made the change;\n- Whether the change occurred in a scheduled maintenance window;\n- Whether the change matches a previously detected and approved change; and\n- Whether the change corresponds with an approved change request, help desk ticket, or product release.\n\nAdditionally, the results of monitoring activities are analyzed to determine the reason(s) that an unauthorized change occurred.

Once organizations are aware of any such problems, actions can be taken such as reengineering processes, implementing improved access restrictions for change, and providing training on SecCM processes.\n\nFinally, monitoring may support the generation of metrics related to SecCM activities. Analysis and consolidation of monitoring reports can generate metrics such as the percentage of systems that are implemented in accordance with their approved baselines, the percentage of IT products that are configured in accordance with the organizationally defined common secure configurations, or percentage of system changes that have been subjected to security impact analyses.
