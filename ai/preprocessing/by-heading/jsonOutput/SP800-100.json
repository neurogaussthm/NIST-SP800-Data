Security is most useful and cost-effective when such integration begins with a system development or integration project initiation, and is continued throughout the SDLC through system disposal. A number of federal laws and directives require integrating security into the SDLC, including the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III.

With $604,875 remaining in the corrective action budget, the agency would proceed with prioritization into cells MB and LA. Totaling those two cells yields $2,619,505. Clearly, this total exceeds the remaining corrective action budget, so stakeholders will have to decide on how to allocate the remaining dollars. Should stakeholders determine that the corrective action impact order (G, A, B) is the driving factor, the corrective actions in cell LA will be implemented. If the stakeholders determine that the system and security control category (H, M, L) is the driving factor, the corrective actions from cell MB will be implemented until the remaining $604,875 is expended."
