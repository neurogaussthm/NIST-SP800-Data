        "content": "An organization often has mission and business-based needs to exchange (share) information with one or more other internal or external organizations via various information exchange channels. However, it is recognized that the information being exchanged also requires the same or similar level of protection as it moves from one organization to another (protection commensurate with risk). This publication focuses on managing the protection of the information being exchanged or accessed before, during, and after the exchange and provides guidance on identifying information exchanges, considerations for protecting exchanged information, and the agreement(s) needed to help manage the risk associated with exchanging information. This publication does not provide implementation guidance on any particular type of technology-based connection, information access, or exchange method. Organizations are expected to tailor the guidance to meet specific organizational needs and requirements regarding the information exchange."

If the information exchange is not properly planned and managed, a failure to protect the information from a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could compromise the information and associated systems. Similarly, if one of the systems is compromised, the exchanged information could be compromised, or an interconnection used to exchange information could be leveraged as a conduit to compromise the other system and information. The risk is underscored because, in most cases, each participating organization has little or no control over the operation and management of the other organization's system. Additionally, each participating organization may have different risk tolerances associated with the information exchange and dependencies to facilitate and rely on the exchange."

Depending on the type of information exchange and the impact level of the information being exchanged, it may also be critical that the organizations establish and formally document one or more agreements regarding the management and use of the exchanged information and the operation of any interconnection used to exchange the information. Senior managers from each organization are responsible for reviewing, approving, and signing the agreement (e.g., Risk Executive (function) [RE(f)], Chief Information Officer [CIO], Chief Information Security Officer [CISO], Authorizing Official [AO])."

The formality, structure, and rigor of the planning phase steps depend on the type of exchange, the impact level of the information to be exchanged, the relationship of the organizations involved in the exchange, and organizational policies and procedures for information exchange."
