The term \"program\" in SP 800-55v2 is intended to signify a flexible structure for approaching activities around the development and implementation of information security measures. A measurement program can be part of an existing cybersecurity program or its own dedicated effort. Measures provide the means for tying information security policy, procedure, and control implementation, efficiency, and effectiveness to an organization's success in its business activities. This document provides a methodology for developing and implementing an information security measurement program, while SP 800-55v1 [10] addresses the selection and development of information security measures. SP 800-55v2 discusses the concept of organizational or program maturity but is not intended for use as a maturity model and is intentionally agnostic toward any specific maturity models."
