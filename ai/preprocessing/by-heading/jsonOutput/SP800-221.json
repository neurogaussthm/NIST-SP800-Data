For federal agencies, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11 defines risk as \"the effect of uncertainty on objectives\" [OMB-A11]. The effect of uncertainty on enterprise mission and business objectives may then be considered an \"enterprise risk\" that must be similarly managed. An enterprise is an organization that exists at the top level of a hierarchy with unique risk management responsibilities. Managing risks at that level \u2014 enterprise risk management (ERM) \u2014 calls for understanding the core risks that an enterprise faces, determining how best to address those risks, and ensuring that the necessary actions are taken. In the Federal Government, ERM is considered \"an effective agency-wide approach to addressing the full spectrum of the organization's significant risks by understanding the combined impact of risks as an interrelated portfolio, rather than addressing risks only within silos\" [OMB-A11]. OMB Circular A-123 \"establishes an expectation for federal agencies to proactively consider and address risks through an integrated\u2026view of events, conditions, or scenarios that impact mission achievement\" [OMB-A123]."

If the financial server supports an important payroll function, the impact of a loss occurring shortly before payday may be significantly higher than if it were to occur after paychecks are distributed. The impact may vary greatly depending on whether the server is used for archiving legacy records or performing urgent stock trades.

A risk reserve is similar to other types of management reserves in that funding or labor hours are set aside and employed if a risk is triggered to ensure that the opportunity is realized or the threat is avoided. For example, the technical skills needed to recover after an ICT attack may not be available with current staffing resources. A risk reserve can also be used with the accept response type to address this (e.g., by setting aside funds during project planning to employ a qualified third-party to).# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT"

For this risk response, it is important that the risk owners collaborate with the acquisition or procurement teams and budget owners.

For example, unused funds could be used to expand a vendor assessment program to ensure that all supply chain providers (including both immediate service providers and their downstream providers) fulfill data processing and privacy risk management requirements. If the current fiscal year only allows for the purchase of half of the required materials, an option can be included at the time of the base contract award for the other half of the materials (but not funded at the time of the base contract award). When the practitioner liberates the risk reserve after the chance of the negative risk occurring has passed, the funding can be used to exercise the already awarded option that lacked the initial funding when the base contract was awarded.

Controls should be implemented with a corresponding performance scale (i.e., KPI), which is used as the basis for KRIs.\nRisk response may also include risk transfer, also known as risk sharing. For example, an organization might hire an external organization to process sensitive transactions (e.g., payment card transactions), thus reducing the likelihood that such sensitive data would be processed by an in-house system. Another common risk transfer method involves the use of ICT insurance policies that can help reduce the economic impact of an adverse event.\nIn some cases, exposure may exceed risk tolerance and cannot be brought within limits through any combination of mitigation or risk transfer. In this case, practitioners (e.g., the system owner) may need to work with Level 2 leaders to revisit the risk tolerance itself. This negotiation presents an opportunity for the Level 2 and Level 3 managers to determine the best course of action to refine risk direction considering mission objectives (e.g., through an exception process, an adjustment to the risk tolerance statement, or increased security requirements for the relevant system). In any case, stakeholders will have applied a proactive approach to balancing risk and value.\nIf an unacceptable ICT risk cannot be adequately treated in a cost-effective manner, that risk must be avoided. Such a condition may require a significant redesign of the system or service.

This process helps to ensure that risk management occurs in a cost-effective way.

In deciding which controls to apply, the system owner collaborates with a security team to consider methods to meet service-level objectives. The team can contact the local power utility supplier to determine electrical availability history and gather other information regarding the likelihood of a loss of power to the important website. This additional information might help the system owner decide whether to invest in a backup generator to ensure sufficient power availability. Results from previous assessments can be useful for estimating the likelihood of achieving risk goals in the future. The team would then move to the next risk scenario (e.g., perhaps an internet service outage) and review the history and reliability of the organization's telecommunications provider to ascertain the likelihood and impact of a loss of service. Iterating through each potential risk, as described in Fig. 14, practitioners can develop a risk-based approach to fulfilling risk management objectives based on risk appetite and risk tolerance.

If any of these three factors results in an imbalance, the solution is untenable. ICTRM informs the decisions around what areas receive priority within limited budget environments.
