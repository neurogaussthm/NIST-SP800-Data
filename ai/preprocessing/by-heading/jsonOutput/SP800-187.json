Besides providing telephony services, cellular devices store and process personal information, provide enterprise connectivity, and act as the primary portal to the internet for many individuals. Phones, tablets, laptops, wearables, cellular modems in vehicles, and other industry specific equipment all have the ability to access cellular networks. The cellular infrastructure of the United States is transitioning from older 2nd Generation (2G) and 3rd Generation (3G) cellular technologies to newer 4th Generation (4G) technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE is now the dominant air interface technology across the United States and is seeing rapid adoption in countries across the globe."

An LTE-specific version of Diameter was specified by 3GPP to, in part, resolve the challenges associated with the use of SS7, although it is not widely deployed. The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Communications Security, Reliability and Interoperability Council (CSRIC) Working Group 10 issued a report on SS7 security issues, but more work is needed before these threats are fully resolved [32]."

Attackers may be able to leverage existing tools for exploiting IP-based networks to attack the LTE core and other associated cellular infrastructure within an MNO's network. Conversely, this may allow already existing IP-based defensive technology to be immediately applied to LTE networks. Hopefully, the application of these technologies will offer novel ways to increase system security."
