In most service mesh deployments in production environments today, all proxy functions that provide services in both L4 and L7 layers are packed into a single proxy that is assigned to a single microservice.

For example, parsing a TCP stream for L4 functionality simply requires decoding a fixed set of bytes as integers (i.e., the packet header), while handling HTTP requests for L7 functionality requires decoding HTTP headers, including complex string parsing and compression with variable amounts of data. Additionally, the data dealt with in an L7 function are user-supplied (i.e., can be controlled by an attacker), while the TCP data at L4 are typically system-supplied as part of routing a request to the infrastructure. This means that there is less room to embed malicious data without breaking the system itself. In one case study, the proxy Envoy is used as the data plane by several service mesh implementations. Historically, the majority of Envoy vulnerabilities have been in L7 function-related code compared to L4 function-related code."

There are three values for the ratings: low, medium, and high. The values assigned to these ratings are relative to other data plane architectures and are not absolute values based on a metric. For example, assigning a rating value of \"high\" to the likelihood parameter for a threat does not imply that the threat is highly likely in all situations.
