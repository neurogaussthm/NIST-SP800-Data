These methodologies will provide capabilities for incident response, secure internal enterprise operations, and support for the criminal justice and civil litigation systems. This document presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture (CC FRA or FRA), which provides support for a cloud system's forensic readiness. The CC FRA is meant to help users understand the cloud forensic challenges that might exist for an organization's cloud system. It enables cloud forensic stakeholders to analyze the impacts of cloud forensic challenges by considering each challenge in the context of the functional capabilities presented in the Cloud Security Alliance's Enterprise Architecture. It also identifies forensic challenges that require mitigation strategies and how a forensic investigator would apply those strategies to a particular forensic investigation. While the CC FRA can be used by any cloud computing practitioner, it is specifically designed to allow cloud system architects, cloud engineers, forensic practitioners, and cloud consumers to ask questions related to their cloud computing architectures. The CC FRA is both a methodology and an initial implementation, and users are encouraged to customize this initial implementation for their specific situations and needs."

For convenience, an already developed security architecture was analyzed -- the Cloud Security Alliance's (CSA's) Enterprise Architecture (EA) [2], along with its various functional capabilities and processes, and the potential impacts of each challenge on performing a forensic investigation if a specific functional capability or process were involved in an attack or breach or were used during criminal exploitation. The analysis spans hypothetical scenarios that would result in exploitation of potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities, exposures, or cloud technology for criminal activities. Such elements are of fundamental concern in forensic analysis as they present opportunities that adversaries may seek to exploit or characteristics that can be leveraged by criminals. In any case, there will be evidence of the attack or criminal exploitation for future forensic analysis. The EA is composed of a large set of specific functional capabilities that enable detailed consideration of the effects of each forensic challenge on each of the capabilities."

For decades, information processing systems have enabled the storage, processing, and transmission of information for public and private organizations and individuals. The maintenance, operation, and protection of these information systems have become paramount concerns since a disruption of sufficient magnitude or specific type could threaten business activities. In addition, the use of these systems in support of criminal activities has been of major concern. Digital forensics has traditionally been used for judicial proceedings and regulatory issues but may also be used for other purposes described below. As computer and information science technologies, their implementations, and their operations have changed, digital forensics has adapted.
