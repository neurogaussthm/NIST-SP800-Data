It expresses that work as Task statements and describes Knowledge and Skill statements that provide a foundation for learners including students, job seekers, and employees. The use of these statements helps students to develop skills, job seekers to demonstrate competencies, and employees to accomplish tasks. As a common, consistent lexicon that categorizes and describes cybersecurity work, the NICE Framework improves communication about how to identify, recruit, develop, and retain cybersecurity talent. The NICE Framework is a reference source from which organizations or sectors can develop additional publications or tools that meet their needs to define or provide guidance on different aspects of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development."

The NICE Program Office staff have received significant feedback from the community, including many responses to a recent request for general comments regarding the NICE Framework and also responses to the public draft of this publication. In light of that feedback and the fast-paced and connected ecosystem of cybersecurity, the authoring team decided to adopt and promote attributes of agility, flexibility, interoperability, and modularity. These attributes led to a refactoring of the NICE Framework to provide a streamlined approach for developing a workforce to manage cybersecurity risk. Below is a summary of changes:"
