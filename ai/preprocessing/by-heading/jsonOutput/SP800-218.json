Following such practices should help software producers reduce the number of vulnerabilities in released software, reduce the potential impact of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent future recurrences. Because the framework provides a common vocabulary for secure software development, software acquirers can also use it to foster communications with suppliers in acquisition processes and other management activities."

There are many models for SDLCs, including waterfall, spiral, agile, and \u2013 in particular \u2013 agile combined with software development and IT operations (DevOps) practices. Few SDLC models explicitly address software security in detail, so secure software development practices usually need to be added to and integrated into each SDLC model. Regardless of which SDLC model is used, secure software development practices should be integrated throughout it for three reasons: to reduce the number of vulnerabilities in released software, to reduce the potential impact of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and to address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Vulnerabilities include not just bugs caused by coding flaws, but also weaknesses caused by security configuration settings, incorrect trust assumptions, and outdated risk analysis. [IR7864]"

This principle, known as shifting left, is critically important regardless of the SDLC model. Shifting left minimizes any technical debt that would require remediating early security flaws late in development or after the software is in production. Shifting left can also result in software with stronger security and resiliency."
