A handheld device can have one card, multiple cards, or no cards. The main suite of applications provided with each Palm OS powered handheld is built into ROM.

Because power is always applied to the memory system, both areas of RAM preserve their contents when the device is turned \"off\" (i.e., is in low-power sleep mode). All of the storage memory is preserved even when the device is reset explicitly (i.e., manually pressing the reset button to perform a warm boot). As part of the warm boot sequence (i.e., a soft reset), the system software reinitializes the dynamic area, and leaves the storage area intact. The entire area of dynamic RAM is used to implement a single collection of free storage or heap that provides memory for dynamic allocations such as global variables, system buffers (e.g., TCP/IP, IrDA communications), and application stacks. Storage RAM is configured as one or more storage heaps used to hold non-volatile user data. Storage heaps may also be ROM-based.

Developers have the freedom to bypass the API and directly access the processor, providing more control of the processor and its functionality.

Initially, Palm OS supported simple multitasking whereby applications could run only one at a time, and were single-threaded. More recent versions support full multitasking and multi-threaded applications. A number of vulnerabilities were identified in versions before 4.0 and subsequently fixed.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that built-in user authentication and content encryption capabilities are not employed for the vast majority of PDAs seized. Therefore, if additional power cannot be supplied to a device, and it is turned off to conserve power and preserve memory contents, the risk of activating such security mechanisms when the device is turned on again should be low.

Because a limited number of forensic tools exist for acquisition of ROM and RAM contents from a PDA, the choice is often simple. One main consideration is to maintain compatibility with the toolkit eventually used in examination and analysis, since interoperability among different PDA tools, especially commercial case file formats, is not guaranteed. In order to preserve the integrity of the data, examiners should handle the original evidence as little as possible. Generally, it is recommended to create a \"master\" forensic copy of the device first, which is kept completely pristine. The master copy is then used to create additional mirror images needed for analysis and examination of evidence [Gas03]. A strong one-way cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA1) should be performed to ensure that the additional images created from the master copy are identical."

Most of the source information comes from PIM data, and Internet related information. Other support applications that run on the device potentially provide other evidence sources. User files placed on the device for rendition, viewing, or editing are also another important evidence source. Besides graphic files, other relevant file content includes spreadsheets, presentation slides, and similar items. For hybrid devices, such as PDA phones or GPS PDAs, additional evidence sources exist, for example, the last dialed number or coordinates to some destination."

For instance, one tool may perform better than another in specific areas such as file identification or search facilities; tools may report, acquire, and examine the contents of acquired data differently; and some tools may be platform specific. Therefore, using a toolkit that offers the best set of features for recovering and analyzing evidence from a specific device is advantageous."

Forensic examination tools are a crucial component in this process as they translate data from raw bit images to a format and structure that is understandable by the examiner and can be effectively used to identify and recover evidence.

Therefore, having a high degree of trust and understanding of the tool's ability to perform its function properly is essential. In addition, a knowledgeable suspect may tamper with device information, such as purposefully misnaming a file extension to foil the workings of a tool or apply a wiping tool to remove or eliminate data. Over time, experience with a tool provides an understanding of its limitations, allowing an examiner to compensate for them and avoid error."

Areas of variability include the search and recovery of deleted information, information on reset devices, or information within compressed file archives or files with misnamed extensions [Aye04]. For example, some tools used to search for evidence may identify files by file extension where others use a file signature database. The latter feature is preferable since it eliminates the possibility of masking data based upon an inconsistent file extension.

Searching data for positive results on incriminating evidence takes patience and can be time consuming. Some tools have a simple search engine that matches an input text string exactly, allowing only for elementary searches to be performed. Other tools house more intelligent and feature rich search engines, allowing for grep (generalized regular expression patterns) type searches, including wildcard matches; filtering of files by extension, directory, etc.; and batch scripts that search for specific types of content (i.e., e-mail addresses, URLs, etc.). Similarly, the ability to find and gather images automatically into a common graphics library facility can differ among tools. The greater the tool's capabilities, the more the experience with and knowledge of the tool become valuable for the forensic examiner."

Search expressions should be developed in a systematic fashion, such as using contact names that may be relevant. By doing this, the specialist creates a profile for potential leads that may unveil valuable findings. To eliminate all possibility of omitting valuable evidence, the data should be thoroughly looked through from beginning to end in a memory window provided by either the tool or a hex editor. Additionally, specialists should have a database of file signatures to locate the headers and footers of specific files that may lead to further evidence such as: graphics files, avi files, etc."

Reports may include the following: Specialists Name, Case Number, Date, Title, Suspect Name, Categories for evidence, and relevant evidence found. The software-generated report is only a small part of the overall final report. The final report contains the software-generated report alongside the documentation accumulated throughout the entire cycle, which summarizes the actions of the forensic examination and presents the results of the analysis, including any evidence uncovered."
