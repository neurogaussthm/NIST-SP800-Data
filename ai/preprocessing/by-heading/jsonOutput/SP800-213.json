However, the increasing scale, heterogeneity, and pace of IoT deployment motivates a focus on security requirement support below the information system level, at the system element level. IoT devices used by organizations will frequently be integrated as system elements, and this integration will often happen well after the information system has been initially deployed. It is important that organizations identify support for system and organizational security capabilities needed from individual system elements (e.g., IoT devices) to help manage risk to the system to which they connect. As an example, an organization may purchase voice-activated printers and integrate them into the existing enterprise network. Organizations must also grapple with the challenge that many IoT devices lack features and functions that are common in conventional information technology (IT) equipment. This lack of functionality in IoT devices can cause security concerns; for example, an IoT device may lack the capability to update software."
