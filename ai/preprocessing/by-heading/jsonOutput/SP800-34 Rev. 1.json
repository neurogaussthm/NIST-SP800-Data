Cold sites are the least expensive to maintain, although they may require substantial time to acquire and install necessary equipment. Partially equipped sites, such as warm sites, fall in the middle of the spectrum. In many cases, mobile sites may be delivered to the desired location within 24 hours, but the time necessary for equipment installation and setup can increase this response time. The selection of fixed-site locations should account for the time and mode of transportation necessary to move personnel and/or equipment.# Alternate Site Considerations"

As described in Chapter 3, ISCP development is a critical step in the process of implementing a comprehensive contingency planning program. The plan contains detailed roles, responsibilities, teams, and procedures associated with restoring an information system following a disruption. The ISCP should document technical capabilities designed to support contingency operations and should be tailored to the organization and its requirements. Plans need to balance detail with flexibility; usually, the more detailed the plan, the less scalable and versatile the approach. The information presented here is meant to be a guide; nevertheless, the plan format in this document may be modified as needed to better meet the user's specific system, operational, and organization requirements. Appendix A provides templates that organizations may use to develop ISCPs for their information systems at the appropriate FIPS 199 impact level. The information and templates provided are guides and may be modified, customized, and/or adapted as necessary to best meet the specific system, operational, and organizational requirements for contingency planning.

These methods use redundancy and fault tolerance processes to store data on more than one drive and eliminate loss of data from single drive failures. Data security involves protecting data both onsite and offsite from unauthorized access or use. Encryption is a common method for securing stored system data. Encryption is most effective when applied to both the primary data storage device and on backup media going to an offsite location. If using encryption for offsite data storage, it is important that media readers (e.g., tape drives, CD or DVD readers) are available at the alternate site location to correctly read the encrypted data during recovery efforts. A solid key management process must be established so encrypted data is available as needed. Keying material, which is the data used to establish and maintain the keys, needs to be managed, ideally at a central location in the organization. These keys should be stored separate from, but accessible to, the primary encrypted backup data."
