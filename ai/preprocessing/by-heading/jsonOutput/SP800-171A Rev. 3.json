This publication provides organizations with assessment procedures and a methodology that can be used to conduct assessments of the security requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be customized to the needs of organizations and assessors. Assessments can be conducted as independent, third-party assessments or as government-sponsored assessments. The assessments can be applied with various degrees of rigor based on customer-defined depth and coverage attributes."

Organizations can use the assessment procedures to generate evidence that the security requirements have been satisfied. The scope of the security assessments conducted using the procedures described in this publication is guided and informed by the system security plans for systems that process, store, or transmit CUI. The assessment procedures offer the flexibility to customize assessments based on organizational policies and requirements, known threat and vulnerability information, system and platform dependencies, operational considerations, and tolerance for risk."

There is no expectation about the number of methods or objects needed to determine compliance with the security requirements. Moreover, the entire list of potential assessment objects should not be viewed as required artifacts needed to determine compliance.

The interview method is the process of holding discussions with individuals or groups about assessment objects. The test method is the process of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities, mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior. Assessment methods include attributes of depth and coverage, which define the rigor, scope, and level of effort for the assessment as well as the degree of assurance that the security requirements have been satisfied.
