This is accomplished, in part, by establishing a comprehensive risk management program that uses the flexibility inherent in NIST publications to categorize systems, select and implement security and privacy controls that meet mission and business needs, assess the effectiveness of the controls, authorize the systems for operation, and continuously monitor the systems. Exercising due diligence and implementing robust and comprehensive information security and privacy risk management programs can facilitate compliance with applicable laws, regulations, executive orders, and government-wide policies. Risk management frameworks and risk management processes are essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the protection measures necessary to address stakeholder needs and the current threats to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based processes, procedures, methods, and technologies ensures that information systems and organizations have the necessary trustworthiness and resiliency to support essential mission and business functions, the U.S. critical infrastructure, and continuity of government."

In addition to a comprehensive and transparent public review and comment process, NIST is engaged in a collaborative partnership with the Office of Management and Budget, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Defense, Committee on National Security Systems, Federal CIO Council, and Federal Privacy Council to establish a Risk Management Framework (RMF) for\n```# Information Security and Privacy for the Federal Government"

There is no single set of controls that addresses all security and privacy concerns in every situation. However, choosing the most appropriate controls for a specific situation or system to adequately respond to risk requires a fundamental understanding of the organization's mission and business priorities, the mission and business functions that the systems will support, and the environments in which the systems will operate.

For example, if a system is categorized as moderate-impact using the high water mark concept because confidentiality and/or integrity are moderate but availability is low, there are several controls that only support the availability security objective and that could potentially be downgraded to the low baseline controls. In this scenario, it may be appropriate to refrain from implementing CP-2(1) because the control enhancement only supports availability and is selected in the moderate baseline but not in the low baseline.

For example, additional information may be provided as part of the process of moving from control to specification requirements and may involve refinement of implementation details, refinement of scope, or iteration to apply the same control differently to different scopes. The need to provide control specification information occurs routinely when controls are employed in a systems engineering process as part of requirements engineering. Organizations ensure that if existing control information is not sufficient to define the intended implementation details for the control, such information is provided to system owners and common control providers. Organizations have the flexibility to determine whether control specification information is included as part of the control statement or in a separate control addendum section. When providing additional detail, organizations are cautioned not to change the intent of the base control or modify the original language in the control.

Moreover, employing the broader construct of a capability allows an organization to assess the severity of the vulnerabilities in its systems and determine if the failure of a particular control or the decision not to deploy a control affects the capability needed for mission and business protection. It also facilitates conducting root cause analyses to determine if the failure of one control can be traced to the failure of other controls based on the established control relationships. Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the degree to which the desired capabilities have been effectively achieved and are meeting the security and privacy requirements defined by an organization. These risk-based decisions are directly related to the organizational risk tolerance that is defined as part of an organization's risk management strategy."
