This adds considerable risk to an organization if the devices are placed on the organization's internal networks, because BYOD devices, which are managed by the users themselves, are typically not secured to the same degree as the organization's own devices. However, this risk can largely be mitigated by setting up a separate wired or wireless network within the enterprise dedicated to BYOD devices. This BYOD network should be external (e.g., off the organization's DMZ) and not grant any more access to enterprise resources than users already have through remote access.

Whenever feasible, organizations should implement mutual authentication, so that a remote access user can verify the legitimacy of a remote access server before providing authentication credentials to it.

VM disks act just like the disks on a regular computer, so organizations should have policies for telework data that is stored in a VM image. VM images can be encrypted on the telework computer when they are not in use and only decrypted after the user provides proper authentication just before booting an image. If VM images are encrypted, an unauthorized person that gets access to the telework device will not be able to read the data stored in the VM image. Similarly, a VM image can have multiple disks within it, and some of those can be encrypted; if the teleworker stores their data on an encrypted disk within the VM, it will be just as if the data were stored on an encrypted disk directly on the telework computer. Organizations should consider encrypting all VM images used for telework to reduce the risk of compromise. This can be accomplished through the use of full disk encryption, file encryption, or other means. For high-risk situations, particularly involving access to highly sensitive information, organizations should encrypt each individual VM image used for telework and may also want to provide a second layer of protection through full disk encryption."

This is discussed in more detail in Section 3.3.3. If data is being backed up locally\u2014to removable media such as CDs or flash drives, for example\u2014the backup should be protected at least as well as the original data is. For example, if the original data is encrypted, then the data in the backup should be encrypted as well.

Multiple levels of encryption may be needed. For example, full disk encryption may be needed to mitigate an attacker who gains physical access to the device; at the same time, virtual disk encryption or file/folder encryption may be needed to mitigate an attacker who gains logical access to the device (i.e., access after full disk encryption authentication has occurred and the data on the hard drive is being decrypted automatically as needed). Removable media containing telework data should also be encrypted.\nMigrate high-risk resources to servers that assume responsibility for protecting them. For example, a teleworker could connect to a terminal server that holds sensitive data that the teleworker needs to access.\nStore and access only the minimum data necessary. Some organizations issue \"loaner\" devices that are completely wiped before and after the high-risk telework (such as certain foreign travel) is performed. Only the data and authorized applications needed for the telework are loaded onto the loaner device. The loaner devices are used for telework only and may not be connected to the organization's internal networks. The pre-use wiping ensures that the device is clean before any telework is conducted, and the post-use wiping ensures that no telework data remains that could be accessed in the future.\n"

Digital cell phones should be acceptable for typical telework. Communications carried over voice over IP (VoIP) services should not be considered secure unless some form of encryption is used; however, many VoIP services now provide strong encryption, which should be used to protect sensitive information.
