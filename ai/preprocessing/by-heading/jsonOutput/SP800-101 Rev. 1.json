        "content": "The digital forensic community faces a constant challenge to stay abreast of the latest technologies that may be used to expose relevant clues in an investigation. Mobile devices are commonplace in today's society, used by many individuals for both personal and professional purposes. Mobile devices vary in design and are continually undergoing change as existing technologies improve and new technologies are introduced. When a mobile device is encountered during an investigation, many questions arise: What is the best method to preserve the evidence? How should the device be handled? How should valuable or potentially relevant data contained on the device be extracted? The key to answering these questions begins with a firm understanding of the hardware and software characteristics of mobile devices. This guide discusses procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital evidence. The issue of ever increasing backlogs for most digital forensics labs is addressed and guidance is provided on handling on-site triage casework."

For example, mobile device memory that contains user data may be volatile (i.e., DRAM/SRAM) and require continuous power to maintain content similar to RAM in a personal computer. Similarly, features of cellular networks are an important aspect of mobile device forensics, since logs of usage, geographic location, and other data are maintained. Mobile device technologies and cellular networks are rapidly changing, with new technologies, products, and features being introduced regularly. Because of the fast pace with which mobile device technologies are evolving, this discussion captures a snapshot of the mobile device discipline at the present time."

TDMA refers to a digital link technology whereby multiple phones share a single carrier, radio frequency channel by taking turns using the channel exclusively for an allocated time slice, then releasing it and waiting briefly while other phones use it. A packet switching enhancement to GSM called General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) was standardized to improve the transmission of data. The next generation of GSM, commonly referred to as the third generation or 3G, is known as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and involves enhancing GSM networks with a Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) air interface. 4G LTE is also available to GSM mobile devices providing higher data.# Transmission Rates to Its Customers"

For example, hex dumping allows deleted objects and any data remnants present to be examined (e.g., in unallocated memory or file system space), which otherwise would be inaccessible through the use of logical acquisition methods. However, the extracted device images require parsing, decryption and decoding. Logical acquisition methods, though more limited than Hex Dumping/JTAG methods, have the advantage in that the system data structures are at a higher level of abstraction and are normally easier for a tool to extract and render. These differences are due to the underlying distinction between memory as seen by a process via the operating system facilities (i.e., a logical view), versus memory as seen in raw form by the processor or another hardware component (i.e., a physical view). Based upon a wide variety of circumstances (e.g., type of data needed, time available, urgency, available tools, etc.), an examiner may select a specific level to begin their examination. It is important to note that once a level is used, alternate levels may not be possible. For example, after performing chip-off (level 4) lower level tools may not be physically possible. Forensic examiners should be aware of such issues and perform the appropriate level of extraction commensurate with their training and experience. With each methodology, data may be permanently destroyed or modified if a given tool or procedure is not properly utilized. The risk of alteration and destruction increases in tandem with the levels. Thus, proper training and mentoring is critical in obtaining the highest success rate for data extraction and analysis of the data contained within mobile devices."

The search engine plays a significant role in the discovery of information used for the creation of bookmarks and final reporting. For example, some tools used to search for textual evidence identify and categorize files based on file extension, where others use a file signature database. The latter feature is preferable since it eliminates the possibility of missing data because of an inconsistent file name extension (e.g., eliminating a text file whose extension was changed to that of a graphics or image file). Similarly, the ability for the tool to find and gather images automatically into a common graphics library for examination is extremely useful."

One should act quickly to have the cellular carrier preserve any data that can be used to identify communications that have occurred and are linked to the parties of interest, stressing non-disclosure of that action to the account subscriber [Ala03, Ala04]. The data available may include subscriber records, the content of email servers (i.e., undelivered email), email server logs, or other IP address authentication logs, the content of SMS and MMS message servers, and the content of voicemail servers. Note that certain types of undelivered content, such as voicemail, may be considered in transit from a legal standpoint in some jurisdictions, and obtaining or listening to them without the proper authority may be treated as an illegal interception of communications [Ala03].

Subscriber information often used for this purpose includes the IMSI from the UICC and the mobile device number (i.e., MSISDN). Equipment identifiers used are the ESN or IMEI of the phone and the serial number (i.e., ICCID) of the UICC. The search criteria used could be, for example, all calls received by a certain phone number (e.g., that of a victim) or all calls handled by a base station responsible for a particular cell (i.e., to determine who was in a certain area at a certain time) [Wil03]. The analysis of the initial set of records obtained usually leads to additional requests for related records of other subscribers and equipment, based on the data uncovered. For example, frequent calls to a victim's mobile device from one or more other mobile devices before a homicide would logically lead to interest in obtaining the records of the caller(s)."

The results of the data analysis can be used to determine the location of the mobile device at a given time [Oco09].

Detailed field tests and measurements may be required to ensure an accurate analysis. Tools exist to aid law enforcement in performing cell site analysis and mapping activities independently. In some situations, such as densely populated urban locations involving microcells or picocells with a limited coverage area, location determination may be relatively straightforward by the very nature of the network. Identifying the geographical coverage of specific cells may provide valuable information when combined with call detail records, geographically establishing plausible locations with some degree of certainty for the times involved."

Attempts at evasion may also occur. A common ploy used is to purchase, use, and quickly dispose of pay-as-you-go prepaid phones to minimize exposure or use stolen phones. To obfuscate usage and complicate analysis of records, a variety of different UICCs may be swapped among different GSM/UMTS mobile devices. Careful analysis of the call records in conjunction with other forms of available data may be useful establishing the relationship between the mobile device and its owner. For example, call detail records of pay-as-you-go prepaid phones are maintained by and available from network providers, the same as for contract subscriptions. By analyzing the patterns and content of communications and mapping the data to known associates of a suspect, ownership of such phones is possible to establish. Other traditional forms of forensic evidence (e.g., fingerprinting, DNA) may also be used to establish ownership."
