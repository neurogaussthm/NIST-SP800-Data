The approach is intended to address the needs of large and small organizations as well as those building an entirely new program. The information leverages broadly accepted standards, regulations, legislation, and best practices. The recommendations are customizable and may be implemented as part of an organization-wide process that manages awareness, training, and education programs for a diverse set of federal employee audiences. The program should encourage behavior change as part of risk management and lead to developing a privacy and security culture in the organization. The guidance also includes suggested metrics and evaluation methods to regularly improve and update the program as needs evolve."

These programs combine to create an overall Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Program (CPLP) that is part of a larger organizational effort to reduce cybersecurity and privacy risks. The resulting CPLP supports federal requirements and incorporates industry-recognized best practices for risk management."
