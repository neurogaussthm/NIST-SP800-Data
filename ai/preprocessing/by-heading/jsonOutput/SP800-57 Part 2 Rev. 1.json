Part 2 (this document) 1) identifies the concepts, functions and elements common to effective systems for the management of symmetric and asymmetric keys; 2) identifies the security planning requirements and documentation necessary for effective institutional key management; 3) describes Key Management Specification requirements; 4) describes cryptographic Key Management Policy documentation that is needed by organizations that use cryptography; and 5) describes Key Management Practice Statement requirements. Appendices provide examples of some key management infrastructures and supplemental documentation and planning materials."

            "text": "Cryptographic mechanisms are often used to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data that is sensitive, has a high value, or is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure or undetected modification during transmission or while in storage. A cryptographic mechanism relies upon two basic components: an algorithm (or cryptographic methodology) and a variable cryptographic key. The algorithm and key are used together to apply cryptographic protection to data (e.g., to encrypt the data or to generate a digital signature) and to remove or check the protection (e.g., to decrypt the encrypted data or to verify a digital signature). This is analogous to a physical safe that can be opened only with the correct combination."

            "text": "Two types of cryptographic algorithms are in common use today: symmetric key algorithms and asymmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms (sometimes called secret key algorithms) use a single key to both apply cryptographic protection and to remove or check the protection. Asymmetric key algorithms (often called public key algorithms) use a pair of keys (i.e., a key pair): a public key and a private key that are mathematically related to each other. In the case of symmetric key algorithms, the single key must be kept secret from everyone and everything not specifically authorized to access the information being protected. In asymmetric key cryptography, only one key in the key pair, the private key, must be kept secret; the other key can be made public. Symmetric key cryptography is most often used to protect the confidentiality of information or to authenticate the integrity of that information. Asymmetric key cryptography is commonly used to protect the integrity and authenticity of information and to establish symmetric keys.

Regardless of the algorithm or application, if cryptography is to deliver confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity, users and systems need to have assurance that the key is authentic, that it belongs to the entity with whom or which it is asserted to be associated, and that it has not been accessed by an unauthorized third party. SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management (hereafter referred to as SP 800-57 or the Recommendation), provides guidelines and best practices for achieving this necessary assurance."

The proper handling of and accounting for keys is necessary for cryptographic functions to be effective. For example, regardless of the cryptographic method employed, some secret or private keys will need to be made available to some set of the entities that use cryptography. Trust in the source of these keys is essential to any confidence in the cryptographic mechanisms being employed. Access to the private or secret keys by entities that are not intended to use them invalidates any assumptions regarding the confidentiality or integrity of information believed to be protected by the associated cryptographic mechanisms."

An example of the fundamental differences between the protection requirements for symmetric keys and those for asymmetric keys is that, in the symmetric case, each party that is authorized to use a (secret) key must protect that key in order to avoid all of the parties who also share the key from losing the cryptographic protection afforded under that key. In the asymmetric case, only the party that owns and is authorized to use the private key must protect the confidentiality of that key; the other key of the key pair -- the public key -- may be known by anyone, but its ownership must be verified in a trusted manner."

As a result, it is important to avoid using a key from an unauthenticated source, to protect all keys and key components in transit, and to protect stored keys for as long as any information protected under those keys requires protection. Cryptographic confidentiality and integrity mechanisms are most commonly used to establish trust anchors that enforce trust policies and practices.

            "text": "Over time, the cryptanalytic capabilities and processing power available for performing cryptanalysis will eventually overtake the protection afforded by the implemented cryptographic algorithms. Most often, the cryptanalytic advances require a transition from a key size currently in use to a larger key size, but they can also result in the need to move from one algorithm to another. Examples include past requirements to transition from DES, Triple DES and SHA-1 to stronger algorithms, and the postulated need to transition from logarithmic and elliptic curve algorithms (e.g., RSA, Diffie Hellman and ECDSA) to algorithms more resistant to quantum computing. Regardless of the basis for transition and whether the transition involves a larger key size or a new algorithm, it is important to begin planning for transition as soon as possible after becoming aware of the need. Changes to either algorithm or key size most often require changes to the code and protocols, not just to configuration settings for the current code and protocols. Frequently, firmware or hardware changes are required. This always takes longer and is more complicated than expected. The transition period is usually measured in decades; during the period between the advent of a practical cryptographic attack and the completion of a transition, all information protected by the vulnerable cryptography is subject to disclosure, alteration, or both."

If the general outline of the sample CKMS Security Policy format is followed, the authors of the CKMS Security Policy will need to consider the basic differences in character between a CKMS Security Policy and a CKMS PS. While the CKMS Security Policy is a high-level document that describes a security policy for managing keys or certificates, the CKMS PS is a highly detailed document that describes how a CKMS implements a specific CKMS Security Policy. The CKMS PS identifies any CKMS Security Policies that it implements and specifies the mechanisms and procedures that are used to support each CKMS Security Policy. Where the CKMS Security Policy specifies organizational roles and states requirements for mechanisms and procedures, the CKMS PS identifies more specific roles and responsibilities, and describes the mechanisms and procedures in detail. (Note that descriptive material can sometimes be included by reference to other procedures, guidelines, and/or standards documents.) The CKMS PS should include sufficient operational detail to demonstrate that the CKMS Security Policy can be satisfied by this combination of mechanisms and procedures."
