Breaches involving PII are hazardous to both individuals and organizations. Individual harms may include identity theft, embarrassment, or blackmail. Organizational harms may include a loss of public trust, legal liability, or remediation costs. To appropriately protect the confidentiality of PII, organizations should use a risk-based approach; as McGeorge Bundy once stated, \"If we guard our toothbrushes and diamonds with equal zeal, we will lose fewer toothbrushes and more diamonds.\" This document provides guidelines for a risk-based approach to protecting the confidentiality of PII. The recommendations in this document are intended primarily for U.S. Federal government agencies and those who conduct business on behalf of the agencies, but other organizations may find portions of the publication useful. Each organization may be subject to a different combination of laws, regulations, and other mandates related to protecting PII, so an organization's legal counsel and privacy officer should be consulted to determine the current obligations for PII protection."

Organizations should use a variety of methods to identify PII. Privacy threshold analyses (PTAs), also referred to as initial privacy assessments (IPAs), are often used to identify PII. Some organizations require a PTA to be completed before the development or acquisition of a new information system and when a substantial change is made to an existing system. PTAs are used to determine if a system contains PII, whether a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is required, whether a System of Records Notice (SORN) is required, and if any other privacy requirements apply to the information system. PTAs are usually submitted to an organization's privacy office for review and approval. PTAs are comprised of simple questionnaires that are completed by the system owner in collaboration with the data owner. PTAs are useful in initiating the communication and collaboration for each system between the privacy officer, the information security officer, and the information officer. Other examples of methods to identify PII include reviewing system documentation, conducting interviews, conducting data calls, using data loss prevention technologies (e.g., automated PII network monitoring tools), or checking with system and data owners. Organizations should also ensure that retired hardware no longer contains PII and that proper sanitization techniques are applied."

However, changes to incident handling processes may be necessary, such as performing additional media sanitization steps when PII needs to be deleted from media during recovery. PII should not be sanitized until a determination has been made about whether the PII must be preserved as evidence. Particular attention should be paid to using proper forensics techniques to ensure preservation of evidence. Additionally, it is important to determine whether PII was accessed and how many records or individuals were affected."
