This publication provides federal agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations. The requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations. This publication can be used in conjunction with its companion publication, NIST Special Publication 800-171A, which provides a comprehensive set of procedures to assess the security requirements."

EO 13556 required that the CUI program emphasize openness, transparency, and uniformity of government-wide practices and that the program implementation take place in a manner consistent with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and guidelines. As the CUI program Executive Agent, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides information, guidance, policy, and requirements on handling CUI [4]. This includes approved CUI categories and descriptions, the basis for safeguarding and dissemination controls, and procedures for the use of CUI. The CUI federal regulation [5] provides guidance to federal agencies on the designation, safeguarding, marking, dissemination, decontrolling, and disposition of CUI; establishes self-inspection and oversight requirements; and delineates other facets of the program."

        "content": "The CUI regulation requires federal agencies that use federal information systems to process, store, or transmit CUI to comply with NIST standards and guidelines. The responsibility of federal agencies to protect CUI does not change when such information is shared with nonfederal organizations. Therefore, a similar level of protection is needed when CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted by nonfederal organizations using nonfederal systems. To maintain a consistent level of protection, the security requirements for safeguarding CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations must comply with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 199) publication [6] and FIPS 200 [7]. The requirements are derived from the controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 [8]."

The requirements do not apply to nonfederal organizations that are collecting or maintaining information on behalf of a federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf of an agency. The security requirements in this publication are only applicable to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. The requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements that are established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations. Appropriately scoping requirements is an important factor in determining protection-related investment decisions and managing security risks for nonfederal organizations. If nonfederal organizations designate system components for the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI, those organizations may limit the scope of the security requirements by isolating the system components in a separate security domain. Isolation can be achieved by applying architectural and design concepts (e.g., implementing subnetworks with firewalls or other boundary protection devices and using information flow control mechanisms). Security domains may employ physical separation, logical separation, or a combination of both. This approach can provide adequate security for CUI and avoid increasing the organization's security posture beyond what it requires for protecting its missions, operations, and assets."

Organizations can use these approaches in source code reviews and tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating flow control mechanisms. To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention.

Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services remains with the organization charged with protecting CUI. Service-level agreements define expectations of performance, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies, mitigations, and response requirements for instances of noncompliance. Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions, ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when there is a need to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services or blocking certain ports and protocols. This requirement is related to 03.01.20."

The system-level SCRM plan is implementation-specific and provides constraints, policy implementation, requirements, and implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security plans. The SCRM plan addresses the management, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM requirements and the development or sustainment of systems across the system development life cycle to support mission and business functions. Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to individual program, organizational, and operational contexts."
