Cyber threat information includes indicators of compromise; tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors; suggested actions to detect, contain, or prevent attacks; and the findings from the analyses of incidents. Organizations that share cyber threat information can improve their own security postures as well as those of other organizations. This publication provides guidelines for establishing and participating in cyber threat information sharing relationships. This guidance helps organizations establish information sharing goals, identify cyber threat information sources, scope information sharing activities, develop rules that control the publication and distribution of threat information, engage with existing sharing communities, and make effective use of threat information in support of the organization's overall cybersecurity practices."

These actors range from individual, autonomous attackers to well-resourced groups operating in a coordinated manner as part of a criminal enterprise or on behalf of a nation-state. Threat actors can be persistent, motivated, and agile, and they use a variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to compromise systems, disrupt services, commit financial fraud, and expose or steal intellectual property and other sensitive information. Given the risks these threats present, it is increasingly important that organizations share cyber threat information and use it to improve their security posture."

Most organizations can receive threat information via email lists, text alerts, and web portals without infrastructure investments specific to information sharing, although the content received through these delivery channels may need to be manually processed (e.g., \"cut and paste\" into tools). Organizations with security tools that support standard data formats can use standards-based data feeds that enable semi-automated ingest, processing, and use of threat information. Other information sharing methods, such as conferences and workshops, require dedicated staff and travel.

Some communities seek to deliver the most current threat information with minimal latency. In contrast, some recipients using threat information for trending and analysis may prefer summary data and may have no need for near real-time delivery of detailed information.

This assessment should inform the prioritization and approach for response actions. Response actions include activities such as identifying and extracting indicators from an alert, using indicators to develop and deploy detection signatures, making configuration changes, applying patches, notifying personnel of threats, and implementing or enhancing security controls.
