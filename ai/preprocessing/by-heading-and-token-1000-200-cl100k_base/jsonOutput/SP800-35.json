The service provider will need clear and unambiguous direction from management (a written \"rules of engagement\"), a set of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and clearly defined scope for testing as well as input on what is required for planning and assessment, requirements analysis, test execution, and analysis results and documentation."

Service providers may have greater leverage to accomplish this at less cost because several customers can share the overhead of maintaining the database for a single IDS product. IDSs require a high level of expertise to operate and manage. If the nature of the intrusion is such that the IDS or the service provider is incapable of resolving the matter or the contract does not require the service provider to resolve the problem, the service provider can contact the organization, which in turn escalates the case for resolution."
