        "content": "Like any information technology (IT), radio frequency identification (RFID) presents security and privacy risks that must be carefully mitigated through management, operational, and technical controls in order to realize the numerous benefits the technology has to offer. When practitioners adhere to sound security engineering principles, RFID technology can help a wide range of organizations and individuals realize substantial productivity gains and efficiencies. These organizations and individuals include hospitals and patients, retailers and customers, and manufacturers and distributors throughout the supply chain. This document provides an overview of RFID technology, the associated security and privacy risks, and recommended practices that will enable organizations to realize productivity improvements while safeguarding sensitive information and protecting the privacy of individuals. While RFID security is a rapidly evolving field with a number of promising innovations expected in the coming years, these guidelines focus on controls that are commercially available today."

        "content": "RFID is a form of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technology that uses electric or magnetic fields at radio frequencies to transmit information. An RFID system can be used to identify many types of objects, such as manufactured goods, animals, and people. Each object that needs to be identified has a small object known as an RFID tag affixed to it or embedded within it. The tag has a unique identifier and may optionally hold additional information about the object. Devices known as RFID readers wirelessly communicate with the tags to identify the item connected to each tag and possibly read or update additional information stored on the tag. This communication can occur without optical line of sight and over greater distances than other AIDC technologies. RFID technologies support a wide range of applications\u2014everything from asset management and tracking to access control and automated payment."

        "content": "Every RFID system includes a radio frequency (RF) subsystem, which is composed of tags and readers. In many RFID systems, the RF subsystem is supported by an enterprise subsystem that is composed of middleware, analytic systems, and networking services. RFID systems that share information across organizational boundaries, such as supply chain applications, also have an inter-enterprise subsystem. Each RFID system has different components and customizations so that it can support a particular business process for an organization; as a result, the security risks for RFID systems and the controls available to address them are highly varied. The enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems involve common IT components such as servers, databases, and networks and therefore can benefit from typical IT security controls for those components."

For example, does the system need to determine the location of an object or the presence of an object, authenticate a person, perform a financial transaction, or ensure that certain items are not separated?\nThe nature of the information that the RFID system processes or generates. One application may only need to have a unique, static identifier value for each tagged object, while another application may need to store additional information about each tagged object over time. The sensitivity of the information is also an important consideration.\nThe physical and technical environment at the time RFID transactions occur. This includes the distance between the readers and the tags, and the amount of time in which each transaction must be performed.\nThe physical and technical environment before and after RFID transactions take place. For example, human and environmental threats may pose risks to tags' integrity while the tagged objects are in storage or in transit. Some applications require the use of tags with sensors that can track environmental conditions over time, such as temperature and humidity.\nThe economics of the business process and RFID system. The economic factors for RFID systems are different than those for traditional IT systems. For example, many RFID tags offer few or no security features; selecting tags that incorporate basic security functionality significantly increases the cost of tags, especially if encryption features are needed. Also, the operational cost of some basic IT security controls, such as setting unique passwords and changing them regularly, may be higher for RFID systems because of the logistical challenges in managing security for thousands or millions of tags."

The most common AIDC technology is bar code technology, which uses optical scanners to read labels. Most people have direct experience with bar codes because they have seen cashiers scan items at supermarkets and retail stores. Bar codes are an enormous improvement over ordinary text labels because personnel are no longer required to read numbers or letters on each label or manually enter data into an IT system; they just have to scan the label."

            "text": "The ability of RFID technology to communicate without optical line of sight and over greater distances than other AIDC technology further reduces the need for human involvement in the identification process. For example, several retail firms have pilot RFID programs to determine the contents of a shopping cart without removing each item and placing it near a scanner, as is typical at most stores today. In this case, the ability to scan a cart without removing its contents could speed up the checkout process, thereby decreasing transaction costs for the retailers. This application of RFID also has the potential to significantly decrease checkout time for consumers."

Today, people typically perceive the label identifying a particular object of interest as static, but RFID technology can make this label dynamic or even \"smart\" by enabling the label to acquire data about the object even when people are not present to handle it."

Some important aspects regarding a tag's form factor include the size of the tag, the weight of the tag, and the method by which the tag is affixed to and removed from its associated object. Tags typically vary in size from smaller than a postage stamp to about the size of a common document stapler. Active tags typically are significantly larger and heavier than passive tags because they have an onboard power supply. Tags that integrate environmental sensors are also larger and heavier than those without this functionality. While increasing the computing functionality of a tag increases its cost and power requirements, it may not have an impact on its form factor because the microchip on a passive tag is one of the tag's smallest components. On most passive tags, the largest component on the tag is its antenna. Tags can be attached to items using an adhesive or can be embedded within the item. The primary concern when a tag is attached to an item is how easily it might be detached, whether accidentally or maliciously. Tags attached to items also are more vulnerable to harsh environmental conditions such as dust, debris, humidity, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. However, the vulnerability is intentional in some cases. For example, RFID tags known as frangible tags allow users to deactivate tags by tearing the tag's antenna from its circuitry. Organizations can create frangible tags on-site using a printer similar to the one shown in Figure 2-2.

For example, a tag might be affixed to the frame of a product on an assembly line in a manufacturing plant. The tag's identifier would be associated with desired features of the finished product. At each station in the assembly process, a reader would read the tag and take an appropriate action, such as adding a specialized component or using a particular color of paint. In another typical application, sensors are attached to tags to measure factors such as temperature, humidity, or shock. Information from the sensors can be used to make decisions regarding the tagged items.

In the case of passive tags, the tags may also need to be closer to readers to obtain the required power to perform these computations.

Intelligible reception of back channel signals from a passive tag requires proximity of less than four meters in most applications. In many applications, an adversary's reception equipment would be conspicuous if it were located within this range. In contrast, reader signals can be detected at distances of a kilometer or more under ideal conditions.

For example, RFID technology increases the likelihood that someone can create PII through indirect means. RFID technology creates opportunities to record, store, and process item-specific information related to business transactions more easily than ever before. In addition, the breadth of items in everyday life that will be incorporated into RFID systems is expected to increase in the coming years. The increase in the coverage of information systems in our daily life combined with the increase of the level of detail of information in those systems will likely create new opportunities for combining data elements to generate PII. Advances in Internet search and data mining software also will facilitate the ability to capture PII from large volumes of what previously might have been considered uncorrelated data. All of these trends can occur even if PII is not recorded on tags themselves."

Many of the items to be tracked, including laboratory samples and disposable supplies, were numerous and would be scanned at very close ranges (within 10 centimeters). For these items, passive tags made the most sense, given their low cost. People, high-value assets, and mobile equipment such as carts, gurneys, and wheelchairs needed to be tracked as they moved around the facility. The readable range for these applications needed to be at least a few meters. The team considered active tags, but worried that they could cause interference problems when located in the radiology unit. Accordingly, they selected semi-active tags, which are less likely to emit radiation inadvertently and which have a considerably longer battery life than active tags, but which still have effective operating ranges within CRC's requirements."

Frequencies throughout and above the radio spectrum were identified in the radiology unit.

Having the RFID systems, desktops, and servers all cabled into the same switches created a risk that the RFID system could be used as a platform to launch an attack on the rest of the network.
