The naming scheme ensures that each vulnerability entered into the dictionary has a unique name. Using standardized vulnerability naming# Schemes Supports Interoperability"

        "content": "Organizations typically have many tools for system security management that reference vulnerabilities\u2014for example, vulnerability and patch management software, vulnerability assessment tools, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems. If these tools do not use standardized names for vulnerabilities, it may not be clear that multiple tools are referencing the same vulnerabilities in their reports, and it may take extra time and resources to resolve these discrepancies and correlate the information. This lack of interoperability can cause delays and inconsistencies in security assessment, reporting, decision-making, and vulnerability remediation, as well as hampering communications both within organizations and between organizations. Use of standardized names also helps minimize confusion regarding which problem is being addressed, such as which vulnerabilities a new patch mitigates. This helps organizations to quickly identify the information they need, such as remediation information, when a new problem arises."
