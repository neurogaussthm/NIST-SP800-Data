A positive impact can be seen by a broader implementation of multi-factor authentication\u2014where in order for a user to reset a password, more than one form of authentication is required (e.g., text message to user, physical token).

While such issues as configuration management or audits are discussed under operational assurance, they may also be vital during a system's development. The discussion tends to focus more on technical issues during design and implementation assurance and is a mixture of management, operational, and technical issues under operational assurance."

When public key cryptography is used for encryption, any party may use any other party's public key to encrypt a message. However, only the party with the corresponding private key can decrypt, and thus read, the message. There are several reasons to choose one form of cryptography over the other. For example, an organization may decide to go with public key cryptography because it is more secure and convenient to use since private keys do not have to be transmitted to anyone. In order for secret-key cryptography to function, the secret keys must be transmitted due to the fact that the same key is used for the encryption and decryption of that specific data.

This module contains the cryptographic algorithm(s), certain control parameters, and temporary storage facilities for the key(s) being used by the algorithm(s). The proper functioning of cryptography requires the secure design, implementation, and use of the cryptographic module. This includes protecting the module against tampering. Conformance to standards can be important for many reasons, including interoperability or strength of security provided. NIST established the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) which validates cryptographic modules to FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. The goal of the CMVP is to promote the use of validated cryptographic modules and provide federal agencies with a security metric to use in procuring equipment containing validated cryptographic modules. A list of modules that have been validated by NIST is available on the Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC) website. FIPS 140-2 specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module utilized within a security system protecting sensitive but unclassified information. The standard defines four security levels for cryptographic modules, with each level providing a significant increase in security over the preceding level. The four levels allow for cost-effective solutions that are appropriate for varying degrees of data sensitivity and different application environments. The user can select the best module for any given application or system, avoiding the cost of unnecessary security features."

Link encryption encrypts all of the data along a communications path (e.g., a satellite link, telephone circuit, T3 line). Since link encryption also encrypts routing data, communications nodes need to decrypt the data to continue routing. In end-to-end encryption, data is encrypted when being passed through a network, but routing information remains visible. End-to-end encryption is generally performed by the end user organization. Some examples of modern usage of end-to-end encryption include Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) for email. It is possible to combine both types of encryption."

The definition of a threat event is somewhat flexible and may vary by organization and computing environment. Although the threats that hackers and malicious code pose to systems and networks are well known, the occurrence of such harmful events remains unpredictable. Security incidents on larger networks (e.g., the Internet), such as break-ins and service disruptions, have harmed various organizations' computing capabilities. When initially confronted with such incidents, most organizations respond in an ad hoc manner. However, recurrence of similar incidents can make it cost-beneficial to develop a standard capability for quick discovery of and response to such events. This is especially true since incidents can often \"spread\" when left unchecked, thus escalating the damage and seriously harming an organization."
