WLAN technologies are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments. The fundamental components of an IEEE 802.11 WLAN (hereafter referred to as a \"WLAN\" in this publication) are client devices, such as laptops and smartphones, and access points (APs), which logically connect client devices with a distribution system, typically the organization's wired network infrastructure.

Also, an organization should have separate WLANs if there is more than one security profile for WLAN usage; for example, an organization should have logically separated WLANs for external use (such as guests) and internal use.

It is common today for client devices to be connected to multiple wireless networks simultaneously, such as cell phone, WiMAX, Bluetooth, and WLAN networks. Organizations should assess the risk of the possible combinations of network technologies for their WLAN client devices and determine how those risks should be mitigated.

Continuous monitoring is defined in [SP800-137] as \"maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk management decisions. The objective is to conduct ongoing monitoring of the security of an organization's networks, information, and systems, and respond by accepting, avoiding/rejecting, transferring/sharing, or mitigating risk as situations change.\" Think of continuous monitoring as doing assessments in near real-time, so that the organization can react to problems in minutes instead of months or years."
