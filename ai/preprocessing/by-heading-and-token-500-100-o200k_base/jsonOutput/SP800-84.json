These plans should be maintained in a state of readiness, which should include having personnel trained to fulfill their roles and responsibilities within a plan, having plans exercised to validate their content, and having systems and system components tested to ensure their operability in an operational environment specified in a plan. These three types of events can be carried out efficiently and effectively through the development and implementation of a test, training, and exercise (TT&E) program. Organizations should consider having such a program in place because tests, training, and exercises are so closely related.

After operational use has begun, periodic testing should be conducted to ensure the continued proper and secure use of the systems or components.

The objectives for each test should be to measure, check, or verify whether the component, system, or group of components and systems satisfies its intended purpose and functions adequately. Where possible, the expected results or outcomes should be expressed in an objective and measurable manner, with subjective measurements being minimized. The results should be quantifiable and repeatable to the extent reasonably possible. Tests are often performed as part of standard operational activities, such as restoring a backup, moving a server from one room to another, upgrading or patching operating systems or applications, or changing hardware components (e.g., swapping hard drives, replacing a failed power supply). Combining tests with operational activities is generally more efficient than performing them separately and is also less likely to negatively impact operations. Other examples of common tests are activating call tree cascades and determining if they can be executed within prescribed time limits, and removing power from a system or system component."

A test is conducted in as close to an operational environment as possible, which means that the test should be conducted in a manner that resembles the everyday work environment in which the system or component is found. If possible, an actual test of the components or systems used to conduct daily operations for the organization should be used.
