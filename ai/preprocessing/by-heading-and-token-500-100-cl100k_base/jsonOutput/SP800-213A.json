Federal organizations can use this catalog of device cybersecurity requirements to determine those appropriate to support the security controls implemented on their system and in their organization. Device cybersecurity requirements are device cybersecurity capabilities and non-technical supporting capabilities needed to integrate an IoT device into a system. Device cybersecurity capabilities are cybersecurity features or functions that computing devices provide through their own technical means (i.e., device hardware and software). For example, data protection using encryption would be a device cybersecurity capability if implemented on an IoT device. Non-technical supporting capabilities are actions an organization (i.e., manufacturers of IoT devices or designated third-party entities with a supporting role) performs in support of the cybersecurity of an IoT device. For example, notifications when an update is available and training of how to apply the software update may be a non-technical supporting capability needed by a federal organization in support of the cybersecurity of an IoT device."

The ability to access the device will support its management and use for cybersecurity. Some form factors or use cases may vary in the kinds of interfaces available for accessing the device (e.g., if a physical screen is not possible). A key aspect of this capability is the ability for organizations to control access to interfaces. Limiting access to interfaces reduces the attack surface of the device, giving attackers fewer opportunities to compromise it. For example, unrestricted network access to an IoT device enables attackers to directly interact with the device, which significantly increases the likelihood of the device being compromised. Authentication of other entities (e.g., humans, other devices) will be a common way to support logical access to interfaces, which has been addressed in FIPS 201-2 [FIPS201] and SP 800-63 [800-63]."
