  "# Abstract\nThis document provides guidance on how an organization can develop information security measures to identify the adequacy of in-place security policies, procedures, and controls. It explains the measures prioritization process and how to evaluate measures.\n\n# 1. Introduction\nInformation security measurement enables organizations to describe and quantify information security, allocate finite resources, and make informed and data-driven decisions for improved outcomes. However, organizations first need to know what policies, procedures, and controls they have in place at any given time; whether those policies and procedures are having the desired results; and how the organization and its risks are impacted. By developing and monitoring measurements that evaluate what an organization has in place for information security risk management and how well those efforts are working, an organization can better address their goals and direct resources.\n\n## 1.1. Purpose and Scope\nNIST Special Publication (SP) 800-55v1 (Volume 1) is a flexible guide for developing and selecting information security measures at the organization, mission/business, and system levels to identify the success of in-place policies, procedures, and controls. This document expands on previous NIST work on information security measures and measurements by focusing on quantitative assessments and addressing organizational and program maturity. The SP 800-55v2 provides a methodology for implementing an information security measurement program. Additionally, while many of the principles of information security measurement may apply to privacy, privacy is out of scope for this document.\n\n## 1.2. Relationship to Other NIST Publications\nThis document is intended to provide considerations for measuring the information security program activities described in other NIST publications, including:\n- SP 800-137A, Assessing Information Security Continuous Monitoring Programs\n- The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0\n- SP 800-30r1 (Revision 1), Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments\n- SP 800-37r2, Risk Management Framework for Information Security Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy\n- SP 800-161r1, Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations\n- NIST Engineering Statistics Handbook\n- NIST Internal Report (IR) 8286, Identifying and Estimating Cybersecurity Risk for Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)",

Hence, assessment is a broader concept that also includes measurement.\n\nOrganizations perform multiple kinds of assessment when evaluating information security risk, such as risk assessments, program assessments, and control assessments. Risk assessments are used to identify the risks that an organization faces and can support decision-making. Program-level assessments are used for decision-making about the strategies, policies, procedures, and operations that determine the security posture of an information security program. In control assessments, organizations evaluate whether specific controls are performing the way they were intended and achieving the desired results. Both program assessments and control assessments are in and of themselves a form of risk assessment and provide a different lens for viewing information security risk. SP 800-55 is intentionally agnostic on specific risk assessment models. Many of these models may help identify areas of threat, likelihood, vulnerability, and impact that require further assessment.# 2.1. Measurement and Quantitative Assessment\n\nMeasures are numerically expressed data that are gathered through the process of measurement. Measures can be derived from any operations or systems that can be measured with numbers. Quantitative assessments judge measures data against a set criteria or target and can be used to analyze information security risks using frequency, rates, financial impacts, and other numeric indicators.\n\nUsing quantitative assessments requires a knowledge of measurement techniques and data analysis processes. One challenge of measurement is using the right measures and quantity of measures to perform useful analysis. A single measure alone may not provide sufficient data to make risk-based decisions, but organizations may also have restraints on resources that prevent them from employing and analyzing every potential measure. An organization finds the number of measures and depth of analysis that work best for their needs.",

A single measure alone may not provide sufficient data to make risk-based decisions, but organizations may also have restraints on resources that prevent them from employing and analyzing every potential measure. An organization finds the number of measures and depth of analysis that work best for their needs.\n\nThe ability to measure information security risks relies on data availability. Methods for collecting information security data may include experimentation, observation, or sampling. The NIST Engineering Statistics Handbook offers detailed information on choosing a sampling scheme, including the following methods:\n\n- **Experimentation** is a systematic approach to testing new ideas, methods, or activities that applies principles and techniques at the data collection stage to ensure the generation of valid, defensible, and supportable conclusions. A recognizable use of experimentation to collect information security data is a phishing test, which is a form of internal security testing where organizations send fake phishing emails to determine which users respond to it. The rates of success are then judged against set criteria.\n\n- **Observational data** refers to capturing data through the observation of an activity or behavior without the direct involvement of the subject. Observational data is often gathered as part of routine information security operations, such as log management tools that are used to collect and analyze network activities. Data from these logs is observational and can be used for further analysis.\n\n- **Sampling** is the process of taking samples of something for the purpose of analysis. Sampling may be used when continuous observation and passive data collection are not an option or when random, stratified, or systematic sampling may be preferred. Random sampling is a method of sampling in which each sample has an equal chance of selection in hopes of gathering an unbiased representation. Stratified sampling is the process of segmenting a population across levels of some factors to minimize variability within those segments (e.g., taking a sample from a terminal in each department of an organization). Stratified sampling may help an assessment target organizational units without being overwhelmed by noisy data collection but can provide biased.# Results",

Stratified sampling may help an assessment target organizational units without being overwhelmed by noisy data collection but can provide biased.# Results\n\nSystematic sampling involves taking samples at a regular interval (e.g., once an hour or from every tenth user). Systematic sampling is useful for identifying macro-trends but may not provide enough conclusive measurements for the entire population if an underlying pattern is present.\n\nOnce the data from measurement is procured, the outputs of quantitative analysis can be used in a quantitative assessment to determine whether the organization is meeting its information security goals and support risk-based decision-making. Data analysis methods are largely based on the type of questions that the organization is asking about their information security risks, program, and controls. The NIST Engineering Statistics Handbook [18] identifies three popular approaches to data analysis:\n\n## 1. Classical\n\nIn the classical data analysis approach, data collection is directly followed by modeling, and the analysis, estimation, and testing that come after focus on the parameters of that model. Classical data analysis includes deterministic and probabilistic models, such as regression and the analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\n## 2. Exploratory\n\nExploratory data analysis begins by inferring what model would be appropriate before trying different analytic models. Identifying patterns in the data may give insight as to what models would produce the most useful information. Some common exploratory data analysis graphical techniques include standard deviation plots and histograms.\n\n## 3. Bayesian\n\nBayesian/predictive methodology consists of formally combining both the prior distribution of the parameters and the collected data to jointly make inferences and/or test assumptions about the model of parameters. Bayesian methods can be used for expected range setting and predictive models.\n\n## 2.2. Types of Assessment\n\nThere are three types of assessment:",

Types of Assessment\n\nThere are three types of assessment:\n\n1. **Qualitative assessments** are subjective and interpretive, using nonnumerical values or categories, such as high, medium, and low or heat maps.\n\n2. **Semi-quantitative assessments** use numbers, but those numbers do not maintain their value outside of the assessment context. This is commonly seen in models that use number rankings to show a level of organizational integration. While the assessment may say that the organization is at \"level 3,\" that \"3\" represents a set of qualities rather than a numerical value.\n\n3. **Quantitative assessments** use data and statistics to obtain objective, precise results, and the numbers retain their values outside of the context. For example, 98% of authorized accounts belong to current employees, and 2% belong to former employees. Here, the values \"98%\" and \"2%\" stay the same regardless of the context. Since for the purpose of SP 800-55 measurement is the process of obtaining quantifiable values using quantifiable assessment methods, measures are quantitative assessment results.

However, they can be difficult to produce in early stages of measurement since they require more data and resources than nonnumerical and categorified qualitative assessments. In contrast, simple nonnumerical and categorified qualitative assessments may be more commonly used and easier to conduct, but their results can also be subjective and require everyone to have an equal understanding of the scale used.\n\nIt is important for organizations to consider their motivations for measuring information security risks before determining whether a quantitative or qualitative assessment is appropriate. For example, an organization motivated primarily by compliance with an industry certification or international standard has different measurement needs than an organization motivated by cost reduction. An organization could have multiple, competing motivations that drive the identification and selection of measures.\n\nWhen real and attainable numbers based on gathered data can be found and analyzed, a quantitative assessment may be the appropriate action. If there are proposed questions that do not have measurable numbers attached to them but still need to be addressed, a qualitative assessment may be the best option.\n\nCommonly used qualitative methods include color scales that represent risk levels or number scales that show rankings. For the purposes of this document, qualitative and semi-quantitative assessments are not considered measurements, and the values produced by these types of assessments are not considered measures. Most organizations will use a mixture of quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative assessments. Ultimately, some or all of the assessment results will be used to determine success.",

Benefits of Using Measures\nDeveloping and establishing measurements to capture and provide meaningful data at all levels of an organization requires careful consideration. Meaningful measures take organizational information security goals and objectives into account and are obtainable, repeatable, and feasible to measure. Information security measurement enables organizations to quantify improvements or gaps in securing systems and demonstrate quantifiable progress in accomplishing strategic goals and objectives (i.e., security posture). Well-designed measurements can provide information on the implementation, effectiveness, efficiency, and business impacts of controls, such as the results of information security activities, events (e.g., incident data, revenue lost to cyber attacks), and information security investments.\n\nMeasurement provides data that can enable an organization to examine the impacts of implementing information security programs, specific controls, and associated policies and procedures. Such data is integral when making risk-based decisions, weighing.# Performance Measurement and Metrics\n\nPerformance against designated metrics, and demonstrating compliance. Measurement can also increase accountability and strengthen governance by providing data that can facilitate the identification of the personnel responsible for controls implemented within specific organizational components or systems and support an environment that allows for continuous analysis and improvement.\n\n## 2.4.

Measurement can also increase accountability and strengthen governance by providing data that can facilitate the identification of the personnel responsible for controls implemented within specific organizational components or systems and support an environment that allows for continuous analysis and improvement.\n\n## 2.4. Metrics\n\nIn addition to measurements, organizations also utilize metrics to track progress, facilitate decision-making, and improve performance. Information gained from measurements may be used to identify and define new metrics. Metrics can be applied at the system level, program level, and organization level. System-level metrics, such as the frequency of third-party access to a system or the number of communication ports open, can facilitate tactical decision-making and support program-level metrics. Program-level metrics, such as the number of security incidents in a year or the cost per incident, may be helpful when making organizational strategic decisions. Both system- and program-level metrics can also support risk management-informed decision-making.\n\nMetrics are designed to track progress, facilitate decision-making, and improve performance with respect to a set target. Metrics leverage measures to provide insight into how well an organization is performing at the program or system level and whether the organization is reducing their information security risk. As with measures, the characteristics of meaningful metrics include the value being objective, accurate, precise, tied to a fixed reference or point in time, replicable, and comparable to previous measurements. Metrics are set with organizational goals in mind and drive subsequent assessments whose results then inform the metrics going forward.\n\nKnowing why measurements are being taken can help when selecting which potential measurements or metrics to focus on. The purpose and output of measurements must be unambiguous and easily understood, and the chosen metrics tell a meaningful story about organization-, program-, or system-level information security. For example, when evaluating cybersecurity awareness training, consider completion rates and the results of review quizzes instead of marking participation as \"low, medium, or high.\"",

For example, when evaluating cybersecurity awareness training, consider completion rates and the results of review quizzes instead of marking participation as \"low, medium, or high.\"\n\nWhen initially selecting quantitative metrics, it is natural to want to adopt any available data points, perhaps with the intent to use them to narrow down focus on critical elements. Poorly selected quantitative metrics can undermine the overall quality of reporting and erode confidence in the work product. When considering a quantitative metric, consider whether the data point directly illustrates the performance of a valid control or tracks the presence of a material risk to the organization's objective. If not, it may be best to exclude the data item in question. With quantitative metrics - initially at least - less is often more.\n\nBy keeping metrics consistent over time, organizations can evaluate long-term performance.# Trends and Expected Ranges\n\nA new metric may provide important insights, but tracking the measurements related to metrics over a continuous period (e.g., quarter to quarter, year to year) will give more information about the success of organization-, program-, and system-level information security plans, policies, procedures, and goals. Some metrics may be gathered because of external guidance or regulations.\n\nKey risk indicators (KRIs) and key performance indicators (KPIs) are examples of metrics, though not all metrics fall into these categories. Organizations may find that a wide variety of metrics fit their needs. For example, appropriate measures at the organization level may include the cost per security incident as part of the budget allocation process, whereas measurements at the system level may include the frequency of virus scans across individual systems.\n\n## 3.

Measurement Considerations\n\nBecause measurement can involve large amounts of data, having a plan for data handling is critical to ensuring that factors such as documentation, data management, data quality, and uncertainty are all considered. An organized and repeatable process that allows for the consistent assessment of collected data provides much-needed context for measurements.\n\nInformation security measurements can be scoped to a variety of environments and needs. Assets, controls, vulnerabilities, and security incidents can all be measured. Measures can be applied to organizational units, sites, processes, and other constructs. Since the high volume of measurements may be too numerous to track, organizations may want to aggregate data to help track security trends across an organization. Organizations will carefully define the scope of measures based on specific stakeholder needs, strategic goals and objectives, operating environments, risk priorities, and resources. As an organization develops measurements, they may want to consider options to make the data collection process easier, such as automation.\n\nInformation security measures can be applied at the system level to provide quantifiable data regarding the implementation, effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of required or desired security controls. System-level measures can be used to determine the system's security posture, demonstrate compliance with organizational requirements, and identify areas of improvement.\n\nMeasurements can be used to monitor organizational information security activities at the program and organization levels. These measurements may be derived by aggregating multiple system-level measures or developed by using the entire enterprise as the scope. Organization-level measurements require that the processes on which the measures depend are consistent and repeatable and ensure the availability of data across the organization.",

However, the following fields offer a common starting point:\n\n- **Unique ID:** A unique identifier for tracking and sorting. The unique identifier can use an organization-specific naming convention or directly reference another source.\n- **Goal:** Statement of strategic and/or information security goals to guide control implementation for system-level control measures and higher-level measures. These goals are usually articulated in strategic and performance plans. When possible, include both the organization-level goal and the specific information security goal extracted from organization documentation, or identify an information security goal that would contribute to the accomplishment of the selected strategic goal.\n- **Scope:** Definition of what is considered in and out of scope. The scope helps explain aggregated risks and distinguish the total risk from the risks currently being measured.\n- **Measure:** Statement of measurement. Use a numeric statement that begins with the words \"percentage,\" \"number,\" \"frequency,\" \"average,\" or other similar term.\n- **Type:** Statement of whether this is a record of implementation or a measure of effectiveness, efficiency, or impact.\n- **Formula:** Calculation that results in a numeric expression of a measure. The organization may also note the information gathered in an implementation survey.\n- **Target:** A range or a designated upper or lower bound. A threshold for a satisfactory rating for the measure (e.g., a milestone completion or statistical measure) can be expressed in percentages, time, currency, or other unit of measurement. The target may be tied to a required completion time frame. It may also be useful to select and record final and interim targets to track progress toward a stated goal.\n- **Implementation evidence:** Evidence used to compute the measure, validate that the activity is performed, and identify probable causes of unsatisfactory results for a specific measure.\n- For manual data collection, identify questions and data elements that would provide the data inputs necessary to calculate the measure's formula, qualify the# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT",

It may also be beneficial to include a sample.\n\n### 3.1.2. Measurement Reporting\nIf a measure is reported to stakeholders without proper context, there can be unintended consequences or indecision. Therefore, a report could include elements such as:\n- Any risk indicated by the measure\n- Whether the findings fit in the organization's risk appetite\n- What prioritization, action, or decision might need to be taken\n- Any compliance issues that may be associated with the finding\n- The impact on being audit-ready\n\nThese examples are not meant to provide a complete list of elements to be included in measurement reporting but highlight how measurement reporting can support organizational decision-making by providing context around measurements and findings.

Any data collected specifically for information security measures are as non-intrusive as possible and of maximum usefulness to ensure that available resources are primarily used to correct problems rather than collect data. Information security data repositories represent a significant collection of operational and vulnerability data. Due to the sensitivity of this data, they are protected in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and procedures.\n\n### 3.1.4.

Uncertainty and Errors\n\nEven when measurements are intended to be precise and accurate, random and systemic errors can still occur. While there is no guaranteed way to measure uncertainty in all measurements, statistical information calculated from the data (e.g., standard deviation, standard error of mean, and confidence intervals) can provide more insight. In addition to making the data itself more usable, data analysis methods can address uncertainty within the data. Organizations often make quantitative projections using statistical methods, such as regression, time series analysis, and machine learning methods. When looking at projections, it is helpful to consider that future events and other unknown factors can cause unforeseen changes.\n\n## 3.2. Characteristics of Measures\n\nThe reliability and effectiveness of security measures require their adherence to a set of defined characteristics. These characteristics act as a foundation for the development, implementation, and assessment of information security measures:\n\n- **Accuracy:** Collecting and analyzing accurate data that aligns closely with the security objectives and requirements specified within the assessment's scope and reflects the intended security objectives under evaluation.\n- **Numeric precision:** Using precise and objective data that naturally uses real numeric values. This facilitates consistent analysis and comparison and enables stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding security posture.\n- **Correctness:** Data collection processes and methodologies that adhere to predetermined specifications and standards to provide accuracy and reliability. The correctness of data collection procedures ensures the consistency and validity of results.\n- **Consistency:** Security measurements that remain independent of the individuals or...# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT",

Types of Measures\nThis document separates measures/assessment results into four types:\n1. Implementation\n2. Effectiveness\n3. Efficiency\n4. Impact\n\n### 3.3.1. Implementation Measures\nImplementation measures demonstrate the progress of specific controls. Monitoring implementation may include assessment results, such as a tally of known systems or a binary \"yes/no\" about which systems have up-to-date patches. Implementation measures look at quantitative outputs and are usually demonstrated in percentages. Examples of implementation measures related to information security programs include the percentage of systems with approved system security plans and the percentage of systems with password policies that are configured as required. Implementation measures can also examine system-level areas, such as the percentage of servers in a system with a standard configuration.\n\nBy gathering this data, an organization can understand how its goals are being implemented and what tasks still need to be accomplished. Organizations never fully retire implementation measures because they are a record of what exists and what needs improvement. However, once implementation measures are completed, the emphasis and resources of the measurement program broaden to include effectiveness, efficiency, and impact measures.\n\n### 3.3.2. Effectiveness Measures\nEffectiveness measures evaluate how well implementation processes and controls are working and whether they are meeting desired outcomes.

Efficiency Measures\nEfficiency measures examine the timeliness of controls by determining the speed at which they give useful feedback and how quickly those issues are addressed. An efficiency assessment concentrates on the evidence and results of quantitative measures analysis. Effectiveness and efficiency together are often referred to as Program Results.\n\n## 3.3.4. Impact Measures\nImpact measures articulate the impact of information security on an organization's unique mission, goals, and objectives by quantifying the following:\n\n- Cost savings produced by the information security program\n- Costs incurred from addressing information security events\n- The cost-effectiveness of any given processes and controls\n- Business value gained or lost\n- Regulatory fines\n- Contractual penalties\n- The degree of public trust gained or maintained by the information security program\n- Other mission-related impacts of information security\n\nThese measures combine the results of control implementation with a variety of information about resources. They can provide the most direct insight into the value of information security to the organization and are sought by executives. While impact measures are largely organization-specific, a general example would be the percentage of the organization's budget devoted to information security controls.

Selecting and Prioritizing Measures\nDeveloping and selecting information security measures consists of four major activities:\n\n1. Identifying and defining the current information security program\n2. Developing, testing, and validating specific measures to gauge the implementation, program results, and impacts of security controls to ensure that they adequately safeguard the relevant attributes of the assets being protected\n3. Prioritizing measures based on organizational needs\n4. Evaluating collected measures data\n\n### 4.1. Identification and Definition\nThis document focuses on the development of measures related to information security risk management, which is part of a larger implementation process of information security measurement. The identification and definition of the existing information security program are important to the development of measures.\n\nIdentification and definition include:\n\n- Establishing and analyzing assets: An accounting of the assets in place and their potential impacts on the organization\n- Stakeholders and interests: Identifying relevant stakeholders and their interests in information security measurement\n- Goals and objectives: Identifying and documenting security goals and objectives that will guide control implementation and ensuring that they can be reliably and# Objectively Translated from Technical Data Sources to Meaningful Business Intelligence\n\n- **Information security policies, guidelines, and procedures review:** Examining existing organization-specific policies, guidelines, and procedures related to information security.\n- **Information security implementation review:** Reviewing any existing measures and data repositories that can be used to derive measures data.\n\n## 4.2.

Developing, Testing, and Validating Measures\n\nKnowing what controls are implemented in an organization is foundational to quantitative assessment. The system- and program-level controls that need to be tracked must be understood before an organization can evaluate what kinds of measurements to take or the process of prioritizing potential measures. This creates a structure for determining what measurements need to be taken and what metrics are used for evaluation.\n\nWhen developing measures, an organization needs to know the attributes of the asset it is trying to protect. For example, there is no organizational gain in trying to measure the confidentiality of a Domain Name System (DNS) registry when the critical characteristics are its integrity and availability. As an organization cannot take and evaluate infinite measures, the most successful measures consider stated priorities that inform the organization's information security strategy. For example, if the organization considers the resource availability of a public website to be of critical importance, then selecting \"the average number of port scans per day\" as a measure might yield an accurate and informative result but not one that is relevant to the stated goals of the organization.\n\n### 4.2.1. Comparing Measures and Assessment Results\n\nQualitative and semi-quantitative assessments may also be useful or even necessary to assess implementation, effectiveness, efficiency, and impact. After implementation measures are gathered, further analysis, not dissimilar to data normalization, is required before the results can be expressed to a non-technical audience. Successful effectiveness and efficiency assessments of individual phenomena may require additional analysis using multiple measures. For example, when looking for \"delayed vulnerability remediations,\" simply checking the mean time to incident response is unlikely to provide all of the information necessary to determine the causes of an issue.\n\n## 4.3.

Prioritizing Measures\n\nAfter implementation measures are in place, organizations prioritize which efficiency, effectiveness, and impact measures to implement. Prioritization can be driven by a variety of factors, including an organization's risk management strategy, mission and business objectives, the availability of data collection for target assets, the value of the asset, the cost of the controls required to prevent adverse outcomes, the potential availability of imperfect or partial controls, information from risk assessments, policies, and legal, regulatory, or other considerations.# Requirements\n\n## 4.3.1. Likelihood and Impact Modeling\n\nLikelihood and impact modeling are meant to work in tandem as part of a larger risk assessment process. Simply knowing either the likelihood or the potential impact of an event is not enough information to determine the importance of a potential measure to an organization.\n\nIdentifying existing data for use in likelihood and impact modeling typically involves working with stakeholders from across the organizational structure. When possible, data from existing risk assessments can be utilized to reduce redundancy and enable decision-making (e.g., using existing modeled data to help decide what measurements to prioritize). Organizations may also have useful data from audits, interviews, surveys, or studies and external data on likelihood and impact. Annual reports can provide information on threat landscapes and the financial impacts of information security incidents that can be used to create models. A wide range of event likelihood models can be used to assess the likelihood of adverse events when determining which systems and controls to measure.",

Annual reports can provide information on threat landscapes and the financial impacts of information security incidents that can be used to create models. A wide range of event likelihood models can be used to assess the likelihood of adverse events when determining which systems and controls to measure.\n\nOrganizations can also compare impact models with event probability models (e.g., expected loss and statistical analysis of historical market trends) to determine their measurement priorities. Controls or systems with higher likelihoods of incident or higher potential impacts if affected could then be prioritized when organizations decide how to allocate measurement resources. Where possible, leverage existing event likelihood and impact models (e.g., risk registers) to avoid a duplication of efforts. More information on quantitative likelihood and impact models can be found in Appendix C.\n\nIn addition to using historical information for likelihood and impact modeling, current trends may provide useful datapoints when prioritizing and selecting measures. Staying updated on current threats allows for more effective continuous measurement and assessment. At the same time, recency bias about current events often influences choices when determining courses of action and resource allocation. Outliers and unexampled events may occur over time. An organization can prepare for these issues using horizon scanning, stress tests, and system resilience.\n\n## 4.3.2. Weighing Scale\n\nInformation gained from modeling likelihood and impact can be combined with knowledge about organizational goals and existing controls to create a customized weighing scale to prioritize potential measures. Using a weighing scale with set parameters ensures consistency when prioritizing and selecting measures, even those that are unrelated to information security.\n\nMeasures that are ultimately selected are useful for:\n- Identifying causes of unsatisfactory performance# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",

Evaluating Methods for Supporting Continuous Improvement\n\nAfter an organization selects its measures, the collected data is evaluated. Evaluation may look different depending on the types of measures being analyzed. Quantitative data analysis methods, like those in Sec. 2.3, can be used to evaluate measures. For implementation measures, evaluation may be as simple as comparing the percentage of controls implemented with the goal percentage of implementation. Effectiveness, efficiency, and impact measures will likely be more complicated to evaluate. Both effectiveness and efficiency measures often begin by establishing average data output and evaluating acceptable ranges against output going forward. For example, an organization may want to know if the volume of data being transferred on the network has an anomaly. To monitor for changes, the average volume of data transferred is established. An organization may also set an acceptable range based on a standard deviation from this average. This may mean looking for outliers in the data or monitoring for changes over time. Evaluating impact measures will likely include outcomes outside of information security, such as financial outcomes or even public perception.\n\nVarious indicators and inputs can be useful to track the effectiveness and efficiency of an information security program by monitoring performance and security over time, such as:",
  "Various indicators and inputs can be useful to track the effectiveness and efficiency of an information security program by monitoring performance and security over time, such as:\n\n- **False positive rate:** The proportion of positive reports that were incorrectly identified\n- **Key performance indicators:** A measure of progress toward intended results\n- **Key risk indicators:** A metric used to measure risk\n- **Leading indicators:** A predictive metric that tracks events or behaviors that precede incidents\n- **Lagging indicator:** A metric that tracks the outcome of events or trends\n- **Mean time to detect:** A metric that tracks the average amount of time that a problem exists before it is found\n- **Mean time to recovery:** A metric that tracks the average amount of time it takes to recover from a product or system failure\n- **Mean time between failures:** A predictive metric that tracks the average time between system breakdowns\n- **Mean time to repair:** A predictive metric that tracks the average time it takes to repair a system\n\nAccess to average outputs, acceptable ranges, and long-term data makes effectiveness and efficiency measures more accurate and beneficial by enabling organizations to track changes over time. Even if processes are not yet consistent, average outputs and acceptable ranges help organizations set metrics. Some metrics are directly related to established averages, while others are set by other sources, and established ranges may not have any effect.# Organizational Goals\n\nWhile inconsistent processes will not provide meaningful data, measurements may still be used to establish average outputs and acceptable ranges for future analysis. Data analysis for finding average outputs and acceptable ranges will typically include historical data and a forecast of what that trend may continue to look like in the future if all variables stay the same.\n\n## Misleading Information\n\nSome measures also have the potential to give misleading information. Inputs such as phishing test success rates or the number of known vulnerabilities depend heavily on the quality of work behind them. A poorly designed phishing test might show a better success rate while giving less information about the preparedness of the workforce to recognize a well-designed phishing email. This does not mean that organizations need to avoid these measures altogether, but numbers alone may not always show the whole story."
