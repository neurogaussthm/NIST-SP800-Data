  "# Abstract\nCyber threat information is any information that can help an organization identify, assess, monitor, and respond to cyber threats. Cyber threat information includes indicators of compromise; tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors; suggested actions to detect, contain, or prevent attacks; and the findings from the analyses of incidents. Organizations that share cyber threat information can improve their own security postures as well as those of other organizations. This publication provides guidelines for establishing and participating in cyber threat information sharing relationships. This guidance helps organizations establish information sharing goals, identify cyber threat information sources, scope information sharing activities, develop rules that control the publication and distribution of threat information, engage with existing sharing communities, and make effective use of threat information in support of the organization's overall cybersecurity practices.\n\n# Executive Summary\nCyber attacks have increased in frequency and sophistication, presenting significant challenges for organizations that must defend their data and systems from capable threat actors. These actors range from individual, autonomous attackers to well-resourced groups operating in a coordinated manner as part of a criminal enterprise or on behalf of a nation-state. Threat actors can be persistent, motivated, and agile, and they use a variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to compromise systems, disrupt services, commit financial fraud, and expose or steal intellectual property and other sensitive information. Given the risks these threats present, it is increasingly important that organizations share cyber threat information and use it to improve their security posture.\n\nCyber threat information is any information that can help an organization identify, assess, monitor, and respond to cyber threats. Examples of cyber threat information include indicators (system artifacts or observables associated with an attack), TTPs, security alerts, threat intelligence reports, and recommended security tool configurations. Most organizations already produce multiple types of cyber threat information that are available to share internally as part of their information technology and security operations efforts.",
  "Cyber threat information is any information that can help an organization identify, assess, monitor, and respond to cyber threats. Examples of cyber threat information include indicators (system artifacts or observables associated with an attack), TTPs, security alerts, threat intelligence reports, and recommended security tool configurations. Most organizations already produce multiple types of cyber threat information that are available to share internally as part of their information technology and security operations efforts.\n\nBy exchanging cyber threat information within a sharing community, organizations can leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and capabilities of that sharing community to gain a more complete understanding of the threats the organization may face. Using this knowledge, an organization can make threat-informed decisions regarding defensive capabilities, threat detection techniques, and mitigation strategies. By correlating and analyzing cyber threat information from multiple sources, an organization can also enrich existing information and make it more actionable. This enrichment may be achieved by independently confirming the observations of other community members, and by improving the overall quality of the threat information through the reduction of ambiguity and errors. Organizations that receive# Cyber Threat Information Sharing\n\nThreat information and subsequently use this information to remediate a threat confer a degree of protection to other organizations by impeding the threat's ability to spread. Additionally, sharing of cyber threat information allows organizations to better detect campaigns that target particular industry sectors, business entities, or institutions.\n\nThis publication assists organizations in establishing and participating in cyber threat information sharing relationships. The publication describes the benefits and challenges of sharing, clarifies the importance of trust, and introduces specific data handling considerations. The goal of the publication is to provide guidelines that improve cybersecurity operations and risk management activities through safe and effective information sharing practices, and that help organizations plan, implement, and maintain information sharing.\n\nNIST encourages greater sharing of cyber threat information among organizations, both in acquiring threat information from other organizations and in providing internally-generated threat information to other organizations. Implementing the following recommendations enables organizations to make more efficient and effective use of information sharing capabilities.\n\n## Establish Information Sharing Goals and Objectives\n\nEstablish information sharing goals and objectives that support business processes and security policies. An organization's information sharing goals and objectives should advance its overall cybersecurity strategy and help an organization more effectively manage cyber-related risk. An organization should use the combined knowledge and experience of its own personnel and others, such as members of cyber threat information sharing organizations, to share threat information while operating per its security, privacy, regulatory, and legal compliance requirements.",

An organization should use the combined knowledge and experience of its own personnel and others, such as members of cyber threat information sharing organizations, to share threat information while operating per its security, privacy, regulatory, and legal compliance requirements.\n\n## Identify Existing Internal Sources of Cyber Threat Information\n\nOrganizations should identify tools, sensors, and repositories that collect, produce, or store cyber threat information, threat analytics platforms, and delivery mechanisms that support the exchange of cyber threat information. As internal cyber threat information sources and capabilities are identified, organizations should determine how information from these sources currently support cybersecurity and risk management activities. Organizations should also document observed knowledge gaps and consider acquiring additional threat information from other (possibly external) sources or through the deployment of other tools or sensors. Finally, organizations should identify threat information that is available and suitable for sharing with outside parties.\n\n## Specify the Scope of Information Sharing Activities\n\nThe breadth of an organization's information sharing activities should be consistent with its resources, abilities, and objectives. Information sharing efforts should focus on activities that provide the greatest value to an organization and its sharing partners. The scoping activity should identify types of information that an organization's key stakeholders authorize for sharing, the circumstances under which sharing of this information is permitted, and those with whom the information can and should be shared.# Establish Information Sharing Rules\n\nSharing rules are intended to control the publication and distribution of threat information, and consequently help to prevent the dissemination of information that, if improperly disclosed, may have adverse consequences for an organization, its customers, or its business partners. Information sharing rules should take into consideration the trustworthiness of the recipient, the sensitivity of the shared information, and the potential impact of sharing (or not sharing) specific types of information.\n\n## Join and Participate in Information Sharing Efforts",

An organization may need to participate in multiple information sharing forums to meet its operational needs. Organizations should consider public and private sharing communities, government repositories, commercial cyber threat information feeds, and open sources such as public websites, blogs, and data feeds.\n\n## Actively Seek to Enrich Indicators by Providing Additional Context, Corrections, or Suggested Improvements\n\nWhen possible, organizations should increase the usefulness and effectiveness of threat information by producing metadata for each indicator that is generated. Such metadata can provide context regarding the indicator by describing the intended use of the indicator, how it is to be interpreted, and how it relates to other indicators. Additionally, sharing processes should include mechanisms for publishing indicators, updating indicators and associated metadata, and retracting submissions that are incorrect or perhaps inadvertently shared. Such feedback plays an important role in the enrichment, maturation, and quality of the indicators shared within a community.\n\n## Use Secure, Automated Workflows to Publish, Consume, Analyze, and Act Upon Cyber Threat Information\n\nThe use of standardized data formats and transport protocols to share cyber threat information makes it easier to automate threat information processing. The use of automation enables cyber threat information to be rapidly shared, transformed, enriched, analyzed, and acted upon with less need for manual intervention.\n\n## Proactively Establish Cyber Threat Sharing Agreements",

Such advanced planning helps ensure that participating organizations establish trusted relationships and understand their roles, responsibilities, and information handling requirements.\n\n## Protect the Security and Privacy of Sensitive Information\n\nSensitive information such as controlled unclassified information (CUI) and personally identifiable information (PII) may be encountered when handling cyber threat information.

The individuals and groups posing threats are known as \"threat actors\" or simply actors.\n\nThreat information is any information related to a threat that might help an organization protect itself against a threat or detect the activities of an actor. Major types of threat information include the following:\n\n- **Indicators** are technical artifacts or observables that suggest an attack is imminent or is currently underway or that a compromise may have already occurred. Indicators can be used to detect and defend against potential threats. Examples of indicators include the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a suspected command and control server, a suspicious Domain Name System (DNS) domain name, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that references malicious content, a file hash for a malicious executable, or the subject line text of a malicious email message.\n\n- **Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** describe the behavior of an actor. Tactics are high-level descriptions of behavior, techniques are detailed descriptions of behavior in the context of a tactic, and procedures are even lower-level, highly detailed descriptions in the context of a technique. TTPs could describe an actor's tendency to use a specific malware variant, order of operations, attack tool, delivery mechanism (e.g., phishing or watering hole attack), or exploit.\n\n- **Security alerts**, also known as advisories, bulletins, and vulnerability notes, are brief, usually human-readable, technical notifications regarding current vulnerabilities, exploits, and other security issues. Security alerts originate from sources such as the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs), commercial security service providers, and security researchers.",

Threat intelligence is threat information that has been aggregated, transformed, analyzed, interpreted, or enriched to provide the necessary context for decision-making processes.\n\n- **Tool configurations** are recommendations for setting up and using tools (mechanisms) that support the automated collection, exchange, processing, analysis, and use of threat information. For example, tool configuration information could consist of instructions on how to install.# and use a rootkit\n\nDetection and removal utility, or how to create and customize intrusion detection signatures, router access control lists (ACLs), firewall rules, or web filter configuration files. Many organizations already produce and share threat information internally. For example, an organization's security team may identify malicious files on a compromised system when responding to an incident and produce an associated set of indicators (e.g., file names, sizes, hash values). These indicators might then be shared with system administrators who configure security tools, such as host-based intrusion detection systems, to detect the presence of these indicators on other systems. Likewise, the security team may launch an email security awareness initiative in response to an observed rise in phishing attacks within the organization. These practices demonstrate information sharing within an organization.\n\n## The primary goal of this publication",

Using shared resources, organizations can enhance their security posture by leveraging the knowledge, experience, and capabilities of their partners in a proactive way. Allowing \"one organization's detection to become another's prevention\" is a powerful paradigm that can advance the overall security of organizations that actively share threat information.\n\nAn organization can use shared threat information in many ways. Some uses are operationally oriented, such as updating enterprise security controls for continuous monitoring with new indicators and configurations to detect the latest attacks and compromises. Threat information may also be used strategically, such as using shared threat information as inputs when planning major changes to an organization's security architecture.\n\nThreat information exchanged within communities organized around specific industries or sectors (or some other shared characteristic) can be particularly beneficial because the member organizations often face actors that use common TTPs that target the same types of systems and information. Cyber defense is most effective when organizations work together to deter and defend against well-organized, capable actors. Such collaboration helps to reduce risk and improve the organization's security posture.\n\n#### Benefits of information sharing include:\n\n- **Shared Situational Awareness.** Information sharing enables organizations to leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and analytic capabilities of their sharing partners within a community of interest, thereby enhancing the defensive capabilities of multiple organizations. Even a single contribution\u2014a new indicator or observation about an actor\u2014can increase the awareness and security of an entire community.",

Using shared information, organizations can identify affected platforms or systems, implement protective measures, enhance detection capabilities, and more effectively respond and recover from incidents based on observed changes in the threat environment. As organizations share information and subsequently mitigate threats, those organizations can improve their overall cybersecurity posture, even providing a degree of protection to other organizations, including those who may not have responded to the threat information, by reducing the number of viable attack vectors for actors.\n\n## Knowledge Maturation\n\nWhen seemingly unrelated observations are shared and analyzed by organizations, those observations can be correlated with data collected by others. This enrichment process increases the value of information by enhancing existing indicators and by developing knowledge of actor TTPs that are associated with a specific incident, threat, or threat campaign. Correlation can also impart valuable insights into the relationships that exist between indicators.\n\n## Greater Defensive Agility\n\nActors continually adapt their TTPs to try to evade detection, circumvent security controls, and exploit new vulnerabilities. Organizations that share information are often better informed about changing TTPs and the need to rapidly detect and respond to threats. This awareness helps increase their operational tempo and reduce the probability of successful attack. Such agility also creates economies of scale for network defenders while increasing actors' costs by forcing them to develop new TTPs.\n\n# 2.3 Challenges to Information Sharing\n\nWhile sharing threat information clearly has benefits, certain challenges still remain. Some challenges that apply both to consuming and to producing threat information are:\n\n## Establishing Trust",

Some challenges that apply both to consuming and to producing threat information are:\n\n## Establishing Trust\n\nTrust relationships form the basis for information sharing, but require effort to establish and maintain. Ongoing communication through regular in-person meetings, phone calls, or social media can help accelerate the process of building trust.\n\n## Achieving Interoperability and Automation\n\nStandardized data formats and transport protocols are important building blocks for interoperability. The use of common formats and protocols enables automation and allows organizations, repositories, and tools to exchange threat information at machine speed. Adopting specific formats and protocols, however, can require significant time and resources, and the value of these investments can be substantially reduced if sharing partners require different formats or protocols. During the standards development process, early adopters need to accept the risk that it may be necessary to purchase new tools if significant changes to formats and protocols take place.\n\n## Safeguarding Sensitive Information\n\nDisclosure of sensitive information, such as controlled unclassified information (CUI) and personally identifiable information (PII) can result in financial.```markdown\n# Loss and Violation of Information Sharing\n\nLoss, violation of sharing agreements, legal action, and loss of reputation. Sharing security and event information, such as security logs or scan results, could expose the protective or detective capabilities of the organization and result in threat shifting by the actor. The unauthorized disclosure of information may impede or disrupt an ongoing investigation, jeopardize information needed for future legal proceedings, or disrupt response actions such as botnet takedown operations. Organizations should apply handling designations to shared information and implement policies, procedures, and technical controls to actively manage the risks of disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Protecting Classified Information",

Organizations should apply handling designations to shared information and implement policies, procedures, and technical controls to actively manage the risks of disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Protecting Classified Information\n\nInformation received from government sources may be marked as classified, making it difficult for an organization to use. Acquiring and maintaining the clearances needed for ongoing access to classified information sources is expensive and time-consuming for organizations. In addition, many organizations employ non-U.S. citizens who are not eligible to hold security clearances and are not permitted access to classified information.\n\n## Enabling Information Consumption and Publication\n\nOrganizations that want to consume and publish threat information need to have the necessary infrastructure, tools, personnel, and training to do so. Information sharing initiatives should be carefully scoped, because high-frequency, high-volume information exchanges have the potential to overwhelm an organization's processing capabilities. Organizations that are currently unable to support automated indicator exchange can explore other options such as the manual exchange of best practices or summary indicator information. As additional resources become available, an organization may decide to use automated tools and workflows to process and use threat information.\n\n### Information Sharing Challenges\n\nSome information sharing challenges apply only to the consumption of threat information:\n\n- **Accessing External Information.** Organizations need the infrastructure to access external sources and incorporate the information retrieved from external sources into local decision-making processes. Information received from external sources has value only to the extent that an organization is equipped to act on the information.\n\n- **Evaluating the Quality of Received Information.** Before acting on threat information, an organization needs to confirm that the information is correct, that the threat is relevant, and that the risks of using or not using the information (i.e., potential impacts of action vs. inaction) are well understood.",

Such restrictions may include limits on the types of information and the level of technical detail provided. These safeguards are appropriate when they address legitimate business, legal, or privacy concerns.\n```# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nbut the imposition of unwarranted or arbitrary restrictions may diminish the utility, availability, quality, and timeliness of shared information.\n\n- **Limiting Attribution.** Organizations may openly participate in information sharing communities, but still require that their contributions remain anonymous. Unattributed information sharing may allow an organization to share more information because there is less perceived risk to the organization's reputation. The lack of attribution may, however, limit the usefulness of the information because users may have less confidence in information that originates from an unknown source. If the original sources of information cannot be identified, organizations may be unable to confirm that information has been received from multiple independent sources, and thus reduce an organization's ability to build confidence in received information.\n\n## 3. Establishing Sharing Relationships\n\nWhen launching a threat information sharing capability, the following planning and preparation activities are recommended:\n\n- Define the goals and objectives of information sharing (section 3.1).\n- Identify internal sources of threat information (section 3.2).\n- Define the scope of information sharing activities (section 3.3).\n- Establish information sharing rules (section 3.4).\n- Join a sharing community (section 3.5).\n- Plan to provide ongoing support for information sharing activities (section 3.6).",

Such sources include:\n\n- Experienced cybersecurity personnel,\n- Members and operators of established threat information sharing organizations,\n- Trusted business associates, supply chain partners, and industry peers, and\n- Personnel knowledgeable about legal issues, internal business processes, procedures, and systems.\n\nAn organization should use the knowledge and experience from these experts to help shape a threat information sharing capability that supports its mission and operates under its security, privacy, regulatory, and legal compliance requirements. Due to constantly changing risks, requirements, priorities, technology, and/or regulations, this process will often be iterative. Organizations should reassess and adjust their information sharing capabilities as needed based on changing circumstances. Such a change may involve repeating some or all of the planning and preparation activities listed above.\n\n### 3.1 Define Information Sharing Goals and Objectives\n\nAt the outset, an organization should establish goals and objectives that describe the desired outcomes of threat information sharing in terms of the organization's business processes and security policies. These goals and objectives will help guide the organization through the process of scoping its information sharing efforts, selecting and joining sharing communities, and providing ongoing support for information sharing activities. Due to technological and/or resource constraints, it may be necessary to prioritize goals and objectives to ensure that the most important information sharing activities are performed.\n\n### 3.2 Identify Internal Sources of Cyber Threat Information# A Key Step in Information Sharing",

Due to technological and/or resource constraints, it may be necessary to prioritize goals and objectives to ensure that the most important information sharing activities are performed.\n\n### 3.2 Identify Internal Sources of Cyber Threat Information# A Key Step in Information Sharing\n\nA key step in any information sharing effort is to identify potential sources of threat information within an organization. By conducting an inventory of internal threat information sources, an organization is better able to identify knowledge gaps. These gaps can be addressed by deploying additional tools and sensors or by acquiring threat information from external threat information feeds or repositories. In large organizations, this inventory process is also a means of discovering information that is being collected and analyzed in business units across the organization that may not be currently shared within the organization.\n\n## Steps to Identify Threat Information Sources\n\nThe process of identifying threat information sources includes the following steps:\n\n- Identify sensors, tools, data feeds, and repositories that produce threat information, and confirm that the information is produced at a frequency, precision, and accuracy to support cybersecurity decision-making.\n- Identify threat information that is collected and analyzed as part of an organization's continuous monitoring strategy.\n- Locate threat information that is collected and stored, but not necessarily analyzed or reviewed on an ongoing basis. If an organization finds useful threat information that is being underutilized, methods of integrating this information into its cybersecurity and risk management practices should be explored.\n- Identify threat information that is suitable for sharing with outside parties and that could help them more effectively respond to threats.\n\n## Role of Owners and Operators",

If an organization finds useful threat information that is being underutilized, methods of integrating this information into its cybersecurity and risk management practices should be explored.\n- Identify threat information that is suitable for sharing with outside parties and that could help them more effectively respond to threats.\n\n## Role of Owners and Operators\n\nThe owners and operators of threat information sources play an important role in the inventory process and should be consulted. These personnel understand what information is available and how it is natively stored; the data export formats that are supported; and the query languages, protocols, and services available for data retrieval. Some sources may store and publish structured, machine-readable data, while others may provide unstructured data with no fixed format (e.g., free text or images). Structured data that is expressed using open, machine-readable, standard formats can generally be more readily accessed, searched, and analyzed by a wider range of tools. Thus, the format of the information plays a significant role in determining the ease and efficiency of information use, analysis, and exchange.\n\n## Addressing Information Gaps\n\nAs part of the inventory process, organizations should take note of information gaps that may prevent realization of the organization's goals and objectives. By identifying these gaps, an organization is better able to prioritize investments into new capabilities, and identify opportunities to fill gaps by acquiring threat information from other, possibly external, sources or through the deployment of additional tools or sensors.\n\n## Common Sources of Cybersecurity-Related Information\n\nTable 3-1 describes common sources of cybersecurity-related information and provides examples of data elements from these sources that may be of interest to security operations personnel. Organizations should update the inventory when new sensors, repositories, or capabilities are deployed or when significant changes to a device's configuration, ownership, or...# Administrative Point of Contact Occur\n\n## 3.3 Define the Scope of Information Sharing Activities",

Organizations should review their information sharing goals and objectives while scoping information sharing activities to ensure that priorities are addressed. When defining these activities, organizations should ensure that the information sources and capabilities needed to support each activity are available. Organizations should also consider pursuing sharing activities that will address known information gaps. For example, an organization might not have an internal malware analysis capability, but it may gain access to malware indicators by participating in a sharing community.\n\nThe breadth of information sharing activities will vary based on an organization's resources and abilities. By choosing a relatively narrow scope, an organization with limited resources can focus on a smaller set of activities that provides the greatest value to the organization and its sharing partners. An organization may be able to expand the scope as additional capabilities and resources become available. Such an incremental approach may help to ensure that information sharing activities support an organization's information sharing goals and objectives, while at the same time fit within available resources.",

An organization may be able to expand the scope as additional capabilities and resources become available. Such an incremental approach may help to ensure that information sharing activities support an organization's information sharing goals and objectives, while at the same time fit within available resources.\n\nOrganizations with greater resources and advanced capabilities may choose a larger initial scope that allows for a broader set of activities in support of their goals and objectives. The degree of automation available to support the sharing and receipt of threat information is a factor to consider when establishing the scope of sharing activities. Less automated approaches or manual approaches, which require direct human intervention, may increase human resource costs and limit the breadth and volume of information that can be processed. The use of automated exchange mechanisms can help reduce human resource costs, and allow an organization to exchange threat information on a larger scale. Automated threat information sharing concepts are further discussed in section 4.\n\n## 3.4 Establish Information Sharing Rules\n\nBefore sharing threat information, organizations should:\n\n- List the types of threat information that may be shared.\n- Describe the conditions and circumstances when sharing is permitted.\n- Identify approved recipients of threat information.\n- Describe any requirements for redacting or sanitizing information to be shared.\n- Specify if source attribution is permitted.\n- Apply information handling designations that describe recipient obligations for protecting information.\n\nSharing rules help control the publication and distribution of threat information, and consequently help to prevent the dissemination of information that, if improperly disclosed, may have adverse consequences for the organization or its customers or business partners. Information sharing rules should take into consideration the trustworthiness of the recipient, the sensitivity of the information.# Shared Information and Its Impacts\n\nOrganizations must consider the potential impacts of sharing (or not sharing) information. For example, an organization may establish rules that limit the exchange of highly sensitive information to internal individuals or groups, allow the sharing of moderately sensitive information with specific trusted partners, permit information having a low sensitivity to be published within a closed sharing community, and allow for the free exchange of non-sensitive information within public information sharing forums.\n\n## Internal Threat Information Sharing",

Business units within an organization that either collect or process threat information should participate in scoping what types of threat information will be shared and how that will be done. The steps for establishing information sharing rules apply to internal sharing of threat information within large organizations.\n\n## Considerations for Multinational Corporations\n\nMultinational corporations need to consider the differences in various nation's privacy laws and how to address handling of classified information, which typically cannot be shared with foreign nationals. When establishing and reviewing information sharing rules, organizations should request input from their legal and privacy officials, information owners, the management team, and other key stakeholders to ensure that the sharing rules align with the organization's documented policies and procedures.\n\n## Specifying Sharing Rules\n\nSharing rules can be specified in a variety of ways including, Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), Framework Agreements, or other agreements. Organizations are encouraged to proactively establish threat information sharing agreements as part of their ongoing cybersecurity operations rather than attempting to put such agreements into place while under duress in the midst of an active cyber incident.\n\n## Reevaluation of Information Sharing Rules\n\nAn organization's information sharing rules should be reevaluated on a regular basis. Some of the events that can trigger reevaluation are:\n\n- Changes to regulatory or legal requirements,\n- Updates to organizational policy,\n- Introduction of new information sources,\n- Risk tolerance changes,\n- Information ownership changes,\n- Changes in the operating/threat environment, and\n- Organizational mergers and acquisitions.\n\n### 3.4.1 Information Sensitivity and Privacy",

This includes PII, CUI, and other sensitive information afforded protection under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and other legislation, regulations, and guidelines. Organizations should identify and properly protect such information. An organization's legal team, privacy officers, auditors, and experts familiar with the various regulatory frameworks should be consulted when developing procedures for identifying and protecting sensitive information.```markdown\n# Information Sharing and Privacy Considerations\n\nFrom a privacy perspective, one of the key challenges with threat information sharing is the potential for disclosure of PII. Education and awareness activities are critical to ensure that individuals responsible for handling threat information understand how to recognize and safeguard PII.\n\nInternal sharing of information may result in disclosure of PII to people who, by virtue of their job functions, would not typically have routine access to such information. For example, a forensic analyst or incident responder may encounter PII while searching a hard drive for malware indicators, reviewing emails related to suspected phishing attacks, or inspecting packet captures. The analyst has a legitimate need to review this information to investigate an exploit, develop detection strategies, or develop defensive measures. If the result of such an analysis is shared with others, steps should be taken to protect the confidentiality of PII.",

The analyst has a legitimate need to review this information to investigate an exploit, develop detection strategies, or develop defensive measures. If the result of such an analysis is shared with others, steps should be taken to protect the confidentiality of PII.\n\nAn organization should have information sharing policies and procedures in place that provide guidance for the handling of PII. These policies and procedures should include steps for identifying incident data types that are likely to contain PII. Policies should describe proper safeguards for managing the privacy risks associated with sharing such data. A common practice is to focus on the exchange of indicators to the maximum extent possible. Some indicators, such as file hashes, network port numbers, registry key values, and other data elements, are largely free of PII. Where PII is identified, however, organizations should redact fields containing PII that are not relevant to investigating or addressing threats before sharing. The type and degree of protection applied should be based on the intended use of the information, the sensitivity of the information, and the intended recipient.\n\nWhere practical, organizations are encouraged to use automated methods rather than human-oriented methods to identify and protect PII. Manual identification, extraction, and obfuscation of PII can be a slow, error-prone, and resource-intensive process. Automated methods may include field-level data validation using permitted values lists, searching for PII using pattern matching techniques such as regular expressions, and performing operations that de-identify, mask, and anonymize data containing PII. The degree of automation that can be achieved will vary based on factors such as the structure, complexity, and sensitivity of the information.",

The degree of automation that can be achieved will vary based on factors such as the structure, complexity, and sensitivity of the information.\n\nOrganizations should also implement safeguards to protect intellectual property, trade secrets, and other proprietary information from unauthorized disclosure. The disclosure of such information could result in financial loss, violate NDAs or other sharing agreements, be cause for legal action, or damage an organization's reputation. Organizations should have a plan in place to address the unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of CUI. The plan should cover containment, control, and recovery procedures; breach notification requirements, and post-incident activities such as capturing lessons learned.\n\n## Table 3-2\n\nTable 3-2 introduces selected types of threat information, provides examples of sensitive data that may be present in these types of threat information, and offers general recommendations.\n``````markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## 3.4.2 Sharing Designations\n\nA variety of methods exist to designate handling requirements for shared threat information. These designations identify unclassified information that may not be suitable for public release and that may require special handling. A designation applied to threat information can communicate specific handling requirements and identify data elements that are considered sensitive and should be redacted prior to sharing. Organizations are encouraged to provide clear handling guidance for any shared threat information. Likewise, recipients of threat information should observe the handling, attribution, dissemination, and storage requirements expressed in the source organization's handling guidance.\n\nThe Traffic Light Protocol (TLP), depicted in Table 3-3, provides a framework for expressing sharing designations [9]. The TLP specifies a color-coded set of restrictions that indicate which restrictions apply to a particular record. In the TLP, red specifies the most restrictive rule, with information sharable only in a particular exchange or meeting, not even within a participant's own organization. The amber, green, and white color codes specify successively relaxed restrictions.",

The amber, green, and white color codes specify successively relaxed restrictions.\n\nThe Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) has also proposed a schema for expressing sharing designations [10]. The APWG schema describes an extensible, hierarchical tagging system that can be used to express distribution restrictions on shared information. The tags can be used to indicate with whom the information may or may not be shared (e.g., recipient only, with affected parties only, no restrictions) and to express other caveats (e.g., that no attribution is permitted).\n\nFor some threat information, collection methods may be considered confidential or proprietary, but the actual indicators observed may be shareable. In such cases, an organization may want to use tear line reporting, an approach where reports are organized such that information of differing sensitivity is not intermingled (e.g., the indicator information is presented in a separate part of the document than the collection methods). Organizing a report in this manner allows an organization to readily produce a report containing only information that designated recipients are authorized to receive.\n\nAn organization should carefully choose, or formulate, an approach for expressing sharing designations. Regardless of how an organization expresses sharing designations, the procedures for applying designations to threat information should be documented and approved, and the personnel responsible for assigning such designations properly trained.\n\n## 3.4.3 Cyber Threat Information Sharing and Tracking Procedures",

Though challenging, tracking of data sources is important both for protecting information owners and for ensuring that consuming organizations can meet their legal or regulatory commitments for data protection. Organizations should\n```# Current Page Raw OCR Text\n\nAlso preserve the provenance of data by tracking who provided the information and how the information was collected, transformed, or processed, information that is important for drawing conclusions from shared information.\n\nAn organization should formulate procedures that allow prompt sharing of threat information while at the same time satisfying its obligations for protecting potentially sensitive data. The procedures should, to the extent possible, balance the risks of possibly ineffective sharing against the risks of possibly flawed protection. An organization's information sharing and tracking procedures should:\n\n- Identify threat information that can be readily shared with trusted parties.\n- Establish processes for reviewing, sanitizing, and protecting threat information that is likely to contain sensitive information.\n- Develop a plan for addressing leakage of sensitive data.\n- Automate the processing and exchange of threat information where possible.\n- Describe how information handling designations are applied, monitored, and enforced.\n- Accommodate non-attributed information exchange, when needed.\n- Track internal and external sources of threat information.\n\nThe procedures should describe the roles, responsibilities, and authorities (both scope and duration) of all stakeholders. The procedures should allow for the effective transfer of authority and flow of shared information to key decision makers and should enable collaboration with approved external communities when needed.\n\n## 3.5 Join a Sharing Community",

Since sharing communities may focus on the exchange of a specific type of threat information, an organization may need to participate in multiple information sharing forums to meet its information sharing objectives.\n\nThreat information can be acquired from public and private sharing communities, government repositories, across the organization, commercial threat information feeds, and open sources. Sharing communities often organize around a shared characteristic or interest. The composition of a community may be based on geographic region, political boundary, industrial sector, business interest, or threat space (e.g., focused on phishing attacks). Many of these communities have multinational constituencies and global reach. Examples of potential sharing partners are ISACs, domestic and foreign Computer Emergency Readiness Teams (CERTs) or CSIRTs, Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs), DHS Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) initiative, threat and vulnerability repositories, law enforcement agencies, product vendors, managed security service providers, internet service providers, supply chain partners, industry sector peers, business partners, and customers.\n\nSome communities are informal, open, self-organizing groups that largely operate through voluntary cooperation. The membership of these communities is often mutable (i.e., no formal fixed membership), sometimes anonymous, and the members may maintain full autonomy with minimal oversight.# Central Coordination\n\nThese communities generally operate under basic rules of conduct rather than formal agreements. In such communities, members publish threat information to the community on a voluntary, ad hoc basis and are individually responsible for ensuring that the content provided to the community is suitable for sharing.",

In such communities, members publish threat information to the community on a voluntary, ad hoc basis and are individually responsible for ensuring that the content provided to the community is suitable for sharing.\n\nOrganizations wishing to consume information can subscribe to or access various delivery mechanisms offered by a community such as web services, email or text alerts, and RSS feeds. Such sharing communities generally make no assertions regarding the quality and accuracy of data provided by their members, and the degree to which the information should be trusted depends on the reputation of submitters (if known).\n\nIn contrast, formal sharing communities may define specific membership rules such as:\n\n- Membership fee structures;\n- Eligibility requirements for institutions (e.g., must operate within a specific industry sector);\n- Eligibility requirements for individuals (e.g., must have enterprise-wide security responsibilities);\n- Nomination or sponsorship requirements (i.e., brokered trust);\n- Probationary membership period requirements;\n- Types of threat information the community provides/accepts;\n- Standard delivery mechanisms, formats, and protocols supported by the community; and\n- Required organizational cybersecurity capabilities.\n\nFormal communities may recruit members by invitation or through sponsorship, and, as such, members are vetted. Membership rosters in formal communities are generally more stable than those of informal communities. The exchange of information in a formal community is often governed through service level agreements (SLAs), NDAs, and other agreements that describe the responsibilities of its members and participating organizations. Some communities collect an annual membership fee to cover the services and administrative costs of the community. These fees vary by community and the fee structure is sometimes tiered, providing for different levels of membership and service.\n\nBefore entering into information sharing agreements, an organization should obtain approval from the:\n\n- Leadership team that has oversight for information sharing activities and for controlling the resources necessary to support the organization's information sharing goals;\n- Legal team or those with the authority to enter into commitments; and\n- Privacy officers and other key stakeholders that have a role in the collection, ingest, storage, analysis, publication, or protection of threat information.",

When evaluating how information is shared within a community, an organization should consider the following questions:\n\n- Is the threat information shared within the community relevant and does it complement existing threat information by providing meaningful insights in the context of an organization's threat environment?\n- Is the threat information exchanged within the community actionable?\n- Does the community have mechanisms in place to accept non-attributed threat information?# Information Sharing Considerations\n\n## Submissions and the Ability to Protect a Submitter's Identity\n- Is the threat information timely, reliable, and of known good quality?\n- Are the information exchange formats used by the community compatible with the infrastructure and tools used in an organization?\n- Given the frequency and volume of data sent by a community, does an organization have the capacity to ingest/analyze/store the information?",

Such conversations can provide additional insight and help an organization assess the trustworthiness of a prospective community.\n\n## 3.6 Plan to Provide Ongoing Support for Information Sharing Activities\nOrganizations should develop a support plan that addresses information sharing infrastructure maintenance and user support.

Most organizations can receive threat information via email lists, text alerts, and web portals without infrastructure investments specific to information sharing, although the content received through these delivery channels may need to be manually processed (e.g., \"cut and paste\" into tools). Organizations with security tools that support standard data formats can use standards-based data feeds that enable semi-automated ingest, processing, and use of threat information. Other information sharing methods, such as conferences and workshops, require dedicated staff and travel. Organizations that actively produce and share threat information are likely to incur higher communication costs.\n\nCommunications may be event-driven (i.e., in response to the actions or behavior of an actor) or periodic, such as bi-weekly reviews, teleconferences, and annual conferences. The level of detail, volume, and frequency of messages delivered in human-readable formats varies widely across information sharing communities. Some communities seek to deliver the most current threat information with minimal latency. In contrast, some recipients using threat information for trending and analysis may prefer summary data and may have no need for near real-time delivery of detailed information. To reduce the number of messages generated, sharing communities sometimes provide the option of subscribing to digests (i.e., compilations of messages over time intervals) rather than receiving individual messages.",

During this ramp-up period, an organization should consult any best practices guidance offered by a community, observe and learn from the interactions of more experienced members, and query community support resources (e.g., community knowledgebase, FAQs, blogs). Community-sponsored training events also provide opportunities for less mature organizations and inexperienced employees to gain practical insights from skilled practitioners.\n\nOrganizations should also establish recruitment and retention processes that reduce personnel turnover and foster the formation of trusted professional relationships between sharing communities and organizations. Retention of skilled staff mitigates the loss of institutional knowledge and preserves investments in training.\n\nOngoing participation in a sharing community is essential for fostering trust, establishing stronger ties to other members, and continuously improving practices.

When alerts originate from unknown or untrusted sources, organizations may need to apply greater scrutiny and/or seek independent confirmation before taking action. If an alert is deemed credible and it applies to systems, applications, or hardware that the organization owns or operates; the organization should determine a suitable course of action.\n\nWhen determining a proper response, an organization should characterize the overall impact of an alert by assessing factors such as the severity of the alert, the number of affected systems within the organization, the effects an attack might have on the organization's mission-critical functions, and any operational impacts related to the deployment of mitigating security controls. This assessment should inform the prioritization and approach for response actions. Response actions include activities such as identifying and extracting indicators from an alert, using indicators to develop and deploy detection signatures, making configuration changes, applying patches, notifying personnel of threats, and implementing or enhancing security controls. Extracting indicators is largely a manual process today but there are clear incentives for automating indicator handling workflows. Manual processing of indicators can be time-consuming, tedious, error-prone, and slow; automation of the activities allows analysts to focus on the interpretation of information, rather than routine data manipulations.\n\n## 4.3 Consume and Use Indicators\n\nThe consumption and use of indicators from external feeds is often a multi-step process that includes some, if not all, of the following activities:",
  "## 4.3 Consume and Use Indicators\n\nThe consumption and use of indicators from external feeds is often a multi-step process that includes some, if not all, of the following activities:\n\n- Validation: verifying the integrity of indicator content and provenance through digital signatures, cryptographic hashes, or other means.\n- Decryption: transforming encrypted indicator files or data streams back to their original format.\n- Decompression: unpacking compressed indicator files, archive files (e.g., zip, tar), or data streams.\n- Content extraction: parsing indicator files and extracting indicators of interest to an organization.\n- Prioritization: processing indicators based on relative importance, the perceived value of a data source, the overall confidence in the data, any operational requirements that specify that data sources.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nbe processed in a particular order, the amount of effort required to transform the data into actionable information, or other factors.\n\n- **Categorization:** reviewing indicator metadata to determine its security designation and handling requirements. Sensitive information may require encrypted storage, more stringent access control, or limitations on distribution.\n\nThese activities are typically performed in the order described above, but the order may vary based on specific operational or security requirements. Where feasible, organizations are encouraged to use automated techniques to make the indicators available more quickly and reduce manual effort. In cases where indicators are being informally shared, such as through email, indicator prioritization and categorization are still important and should be performed by the recipient.\n\nIdeally, indicators are:\n\n- **Timely.** Indicators should be delivered with minimal latency thereby allowing additional time for recipients to prepare suitable responses. The time criticality of indicators depends on the characteristics of the threats, including their severity, speed, and ease of propagation, the infrastructure being targeted, the TTPs being used, and the capabilities of the actor(s).\n\n- **Relevant.** Indicators should be applicable to a recipient's operating environment and address threats the organization is likely to face. The unnecessary processing of extraneous indicators creates additional work for analysts and slows down prioritization and categorization actions.\n\n- **Accurate.** Indicators should be correct, complete, and unambiguous. Inaccurate or incomplete information introduces uncertainty and may prevent critical action, stimulate unnecessary action, result in ineffective responses, or instill a false sense of security. Recipients should be made aware of any uncertainty or caveats regarding the accuracy of an indicator.",

For example, a lone indicator may be ambiguous, but when aggregated and analyzed with threat information from other sources the indicator is enriched and demonstrates additional value. Also, threat information from multiple sources may vary in precision and accuracy and it is important for users to be able to evaluate the information and assign tags that describe the quality or confidence level of the information. The tags are especially important when an organization needs to resolve discrepancies between threat information sources. As organizations enrich indicators, any new insights should be shared so that the entire community may benefit. Organizations may, for example, use externally and internally-generated indicators to:\n\n- Add or modify rules or signatures used by firewalls, intrusion detection systems, data loss prevention.# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n## Systems and Security Controls",

Indicators received from a trusted source might be put to immediate use to detect and respond to a threat. In contrast, indicators originating from an untrusted source may require independent validation, additional research, or testing before use. Indicator use might also be affected by other factors, such as an organization's tolerance for service disruptions.

For some organizations, security is paramount and occasionally blocking benign activity is considered acceptable. For other organizations, service availability may be so important that possible malicious activity might only trigger monitoring.\n\nAn organization should carefully consider the characteristics of indicators that it receives and should take a risk-based approach to determining how indicators can be most effectively used. An organization may find that a specific indicator is useful in some situations but not in others. Ultimately each organization must decide how to best use indicators.\n\n## 4.4 Organize and Store Cyber Threat Information\n\nOrganizations may collect indicators from a variety of sources, including open source repositories, commercial threat feeds, and external partners. Depending on how indicators are being used, there may be a need to organize them in a knowledgebase. Free-form methods such as wikis can be quite flexible and suitable for developing working notes and indicator metadata. Structured databases are also useful for storing, organizing, tracking, querying, and analyzing collections of indicators.\n\nInformation commonly recorded in a knowledgebase includes the following, when known:\n\n- Source of an indicator;\n- Rules governing the use or sharing of an indicator;\n- Date or time an indicator was collected;\n- Length of time that an indicator is still considered valid;\n- Whether or not attacks associated with an indicator have targeted specific organizations or sectors;\n- Any Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) records associated with an indicator;\n- Groups or actors associated with an indicator;\n- Aliases of any associated actors;# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n- TTPs commonly used by an actor;\n- Motives or intent of an associated actor;\n- Individuals or types of individuals targeted in associated attacks; and\n- Systems targeted in attacks.",

Policies and procedures should define data retention requirements for short (online) and long (offline) term availability of indicator information. Information handling and retention requirements may change once threat information is entered into evidence. Evidence acquired during any incident investigations, for instance, should be collected and preserved using best practices for data preservation following chain of custody requirements and other laws pertaining to the submission of evidence. A more detailed treatment of forensic techniques related to chain of custody and preserving information integrity is available in NIST Special Publication 800-86 [12] and Section 3.3.2 of NIST Special Publication 800-61 [1].\n\nFor indicators that are not needed as evidence, organizations should determine proper retention policies. Although retaining threat information has costs, detailed information may provide historical value as well as help new sharing community members and partners understand the persistence and evolution of different actors and attack types. Other considerations, such as financial, legal, contractual, or regulatory issues, may limit data retention to a fixed period of months or years. Once a retention schedule is identified, organizations should either archive or destroy the indicators per applicable policies.\n\n## 4.5 Produce and Publish Indicators",

Once a retention schedule is identified, organizations should either archive or destroy the indicators per applicable policies.\n\n## 4.5 Produce and Publish Indicators\n\nMany organizations only consume indicators. However, some organizations, often those with more advanced security capabilities, choose to produce and publish their own indicators. An organization may benefit substantially by producing threat information. For example, an organization may gain greater expertise, help other organizations more effectively respond to threats in their environments, and foster trust with other community members. These effects are important for building and sustaining the flow of threat information that ultimately benefits a producing organization. A producer of shared threat information must decide what, if any, metadata should accompany shared information, what data formats should be used, how sensitive data should be handled, and how information sharing rules should be updated over time. The following subsections address these issues.\n\n### 4.5.1 Indicator Enrichment\n\nIndicators that are produced and published should include metadata that provides context for each indicator, describes how the indicator is to be used and interpreted and how the# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Indicator Relates to Other Indicators\n\nMetadata may also include sensitivity designations and provenance information (e.g., what tool was used to acquire the data, how the data was processed, who collected the data). As indicators are created, aggregated, or enriched, their sensitivity and classification should be reevaluated. An aggregation, association, or enrichment process may enable re-identification (e.g., using data mining techniques) or elevate the sensitivity of the information, thus necessitating additional data handling restrictions.\n\n## Indicator Production Process",

An aggregation, association, or enrichment process may enable re-identification (e.g., using data mining techniques) or elevate the sensitivity of the information, thus necessitating additional data handling restrictions.\n\n## Indicator Production Process\n\nThe indicator production process should provide a mechanism for publishing indicators, updating indicators and associated metadata, and retracting submissions that are incorrect or perhaps inadvertently shared. Any automated mechanisms should be hardened and tested to ensure that they do not become viable attack vectors for threat actors. Organizations that share indicators should provide a feedback mechanism that allows sharing partners to submit error reports, suggest improvements, or request additional information about the indicators. Such feedback plays an important role in the enrichment, maturation, and quality of the indicators shared within a community.\n\n## Information Markings\n\nSome information shared within a community may be marked as \"currently under investigation\" and may require that members avoid sharing beyond the collective; such markings may also prohibit members from performing active information collection (such as retrieving malware samples from a suspect website, or performing DNS lookups on suspect hostnames) that might tip off a potential actor or otherwise compromise investigative activities. At some point, such information will probably have its distribution and investigation restrictions downgraded, so a mechanism to change the marking or to add a revised marking such as \"downgraded to GREEN as of 12/20/2015\" is useful.\n\n## 4.5.2 Standard Data Formats\n\nThe use of standard data formats for the exchange of indicators enhances interoperability and allows information to be exchanged with greater speed. Unstructured formats (e.g., text documents, email) are suitable for high-level threat reports and ad hoc exchanges of indicator information and other materials intended to be read by security personnel rather than machines. For time-critical exchanges of indicators, however, such as automatically configuring a firewall to block specified communications, the use of standard data formats is encouraged because such formats reduce the need for human assistance.",

Organizations should seek out data formats and exchange protocols that can effectively support their key threat information sharing use cases, demonstrate a high degree of maturity, broad adoption, and enable interoperability between a wide range of products and/or organizations.\n\n## 4.5.3 Protection of Sensitive Data\n\nThe indicators that an organization publishes may be sensitive, so proper safeguards should be used to# Prevent Unauthorized Disclosure or Modification\n\nIndicator data can be protected using a variety of methods, including encrypted network communications, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and storage in a hardened repository.\n\nIf a repository is used, an organization should have a written SLA for the repository that specifies expected availability, security posture requirements, and acceptable use policies.\n\nWhen producing indicators that may contain sensitive information, proper sharing rules (see section 3.4) should be followed, and information should be shared only with community members that are trusted to follow sharing rules and that have agreed to do so."
