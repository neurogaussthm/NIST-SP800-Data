These risks are associated with an enterprise's decreased visibility into and understanding of how the technology they acquire is developed, integrated, and deployed or the processes, procedures, standards, and practices used to ensure the security, resilience, reliability, safety, integrity, and quality of the products and services.\n\nThis publication provides guidance to organizations on identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain at all levels of their organizations. The publication integrates cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) into risk management activities by applying a multilevel, C-SCRM-specific approach, including guidance on the development of C-SCRM strategy implementation plans, C-SCRM policies, C-SCRM plans, and risk assessments for products and services.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nInformation and communications technology (ICT) and operational technology (OT) rely on a complex, globally distributed, extensive, and interconnected supply chain ecosystem that is comprised of geographically diverse routes and consists of multiple levels of outsourcing. This ecosystem is composed of public and private sector entities (e.g., acquirers, suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers) that interact to research, develop, design, manufacture, acquire, deliver, integrate, operate, maintain, dispose of, and otherwise utilize or manage ICT/OT products and services. These interactions are shaped and influenced by a set of technologies, laws, policies, procedures, and practices.\n\nThis ecosystem has evolved to provide a set of highly refined, cost-effective, and reusable solutions. Public and private sector entities have rapidly adopted this ecosystem of solutions and increased their reliance on commercially available products, system integrator support for custom-built systems, and external service providers. This, in turn, has increased the complexity, diversity, and scale of these entities, and often their interdependent supply chains.\n\nIn this document, the term supply chain refers to the linked set of resources and processes between and among multiple levels of an enterprise, each of which is an acquirer that begins with the sourcing of products and services and extends through the product and service life cycle.",

Cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain are the results of threats that exploit vulnerabilities or exposures within products and services that traverse the supply chain or threats that exploit.\n```# Cybersecurity Risks in the Supply Chain\n\nVulnerabilities or exposures within the supply chain itself. Examples of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain include:\n\n1. A widget manufacturer whose design material is stolen in another country, resulting in the loss of intellectual property and market share.\n2. A widget manufacture that experiences a supply disruption for critical manufacturing components due to a ransomware attack at a supplier three tiers down in the supply chain.\n3. A store chain that experiences a massive data breach tied to an HVAC vendor with access to the store chain's data-sharing portal.\n\nNote that SCRM and C-SCRM refer to the same concept for the purposes of NIST publications. In general practice, C-SCRM is at the nexus of traditional Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) and traditional Information Security. Organizations may employ different terms and definitions for SCRM outside of the scope of this publication. This publication does not address many of the non-cybersecurity aspects of SCRM.\n\n## Technology Solutions in the Supply Chain\n\nTechnology solutions provided through a supply chain of competing vendors offer significant benefits, including low cost, interoperability, rapid innovation, and product feature variety. Whether proprietary, government-developed, or open source, these solutions can meet the needs of a global base of public and private sector customers. However, the same factors that create such benefits also increase the potential for cybersecurity risks that arise directly or indirectly from the supply chain.",

However, the same factors that create such benefits also increase the potential for cybersecurity risks that arise directly or indirectly from the supply chain.\n\nCybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain are often undetected and impact the acquirer and the end-user. For example, deployed software is typically a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product, which includes smaller COTS or open source software components developed or sourced at multiple tiers. Updates to software deployed across enterprises often fail to update the smaller COTS components with known vulnerabilities, including cases in which the component vulnerabilities are exploitable in the larger enterprise software.\n\nSoftware users may be unable to detect the smaller known vulnerable components in larger COTS software (e.g., lack of transparency, insufficient vulnerability management). The non-standardized nature of C-SCRM practices adds an additional layer of complexity as this makes the consistent measurement and management of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain difficult for both the organization and members of its supply chain (e.g., suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers).\n\n## C-SCRM Practices and Controls\n\nIn this document, the practices and controls described for Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) apply to both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) environments and are inclusive of IoT. Similar to IT environments that rely on ICT products and services, OT environments rely on OT and ICT products and services, with cybersecurity risks arising from ICT/OT products, services, suppliers, and their supply chains.",

Overcoming this complexity requires interagency coordination and partnerships.\n\nThe passage of the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act (FASCSA) of 2018 aimed to address this concern by creating a government-wide approach to the problem of supply chain security in federal acquisitions by establishing the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC). The FASC serves as a focal point of coordination and information sharing and a harmonized approach to acquisition security that addresses C-SCRM in acquisition processes and procurements across the federal enterprise.\n\nIn addition, the law incorporated SCRM into FISMA by requiring reports on the progress and effectiveness of the agency's supply chain risk management, consistent with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Council.",

In practice, an organization is defined as an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within a larger enterprise structure (e.g., a federal agency or company). By this definition, an enterprise is an organization, but it exists at the top level of the hierarchy where individual senior leaders have unique risk management responsibilities [IR8286]. Several organizations may comprise an enterprise. In these cases, an enterprise may have multiple Level 1s with stakeholders and activities defined at both the enterprise and the organization levels. Level 1 activities conducted at the enterprise level should inform those activities completed within the subordinate organizations.\n\nEnterprises and organizations tailor the C-SCRM practices described in this publication as applicable and appropriate based on their own unique enterprise structure. There are cases in this publication in which the term \"organization\" is inherited from a referenced source (e.g., other NIST publication, regulatory language).

Purpose\n\nCybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) is a systematic process for managing exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and developing appropriate response strategies, policies, processes, and procedures. The purpose of this publication is to provide guidance to enterprises on how to identify, assess, select, and implement risk management processes and mitigating controls across the enterprise to help manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. The content in this guidance is the shared.# Responsibility of Different Disciplines with Different SCRM Perspectives\n\nThe C-SCRM guidance provided in this document is not one-size-fits-all. Instead, the guidance throughout this publication should be adopted and tailored to the unique size, resources, and risk circumstances of each enterprise. Enterprises adopting this guidance may vary in how they implement C-SCRM practices internally. To that end, this publication describes C-SCRM practices observed in enterprises and offers a general prioritization of C-SCRM practices (i.e., Foundational, Sustaining, Enabling) for enterprises to consider as they implement and mature C-SCRM. However, this publication does not offer a specific roadmap for enterprises to follow to reach various states of capability and maturity.\n\nThe processes and controls identified in this document can be modified or augmented with enterprise-specific requirements from policies, guidelines, response strategies, and other sources. This publication empowers enterprises to develop C-SCRM strategies tailored to their specific mission and business needs, threats, and operational environments.\n\n## 1.2.

The level of exposure to# Cybersecurity Risks\n\nThroughout the supply chain depends largely on the relationship between the products and services provided and the criticality of the missions, business processes, and systems that they support. Enterprises have a variety of relationships with their suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers.\n\n## Figure 2\n\nFigure 2 depicts how these diverse relationships affect an enterprise's visibility and control of the supply chain.\n\nSome supply chain relationships are tightly intermingled, such as a system integrator's development of a complex information system operating within the federal agency's authorization boundary or the management of federal agency information systems and resources by an external service provider. These relationships are usually guided by an agreement (e.g., contract) that establishes detailed functional, technical, and security requirements and may provide for the custom development or significant customization of products and services.\n\nFor these relationships, system integrators and external service providers are likely able to work with the enterprise to implement such processes and controls (listed within this document) that are deemed appropriate based on the results of a criticality and risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis.

This relationship is also usually guided by an agreement between the acquirer and the supplier. However, commercial ICT/OT developed by suppliers are typically designed for general purposes for a global market and are not tailored to an individual customer's specific operational or threat environments.\n\nEnterprises should perform due diligence and research regarding their specific C-SCRM requirements to determine if an IT solution is fit for purpose, includes requisite security features and capabilities, will meet quality and resiliency expectations, and requires support by the supplier for the product or product components over its life cycle.\n\nAn assessment of the findings of an acquirer's research about a product, which...```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nmay include engaging in direct dialogue with suppliers whenever possible, will help acquirers understand the characteristics and capabilities of existing ICT/OT products and services, set expectations and requirements for suppliers, and identify C-SCRM needs not yet satisfied by the market. It can also help identify emerging solutions that may at least partially support the acquirer's needs.

Enterprises should be aware that implementing C-SCRM practices and controls necessitates additional financial and human resources. Requiring a greater level of testing, documentation, or security features from suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers may increase the price of a product or service, which may result in increased cost to the acquirer. This is especially true for those products and services developed for general-purpose applications and not tailored to the specific enterprise security or C-SCRM requirements. When deciding whether to require and implement C-SCRM practices and controls, acquirers should consider both the costs of implementing these controls and the risks of not implementing them.\n\nWhen possible and appropriate, acquirers should allow suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers the opportunity to reuse applicable existing data and documentation that may provide evidence to support C-SCRM (e.g., certification of a vendor to a relevant standard, such as ISO 27001). Doing this results in cost savings to the acquirer and supplier. However, in some cases, documentation reuse may not be appropriate as additional or different information may be needed, and a reassessment may be required (e.g., previously audited supplier developing a new, not yet produced product). Regardless, acquirers should identify and include security considerations early in the acquisition process.",

Successful C-SCRM requires an enterprise-wide cultural shift to a state of heightened awareness and preparedness as to the potential ramifications of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.\n\nEnterprises should aim to infuse perspectives from multiple disciplines and processes (e.g., information security, procurement, enterprise risk management, engineering, software development, IT, legal, HR) into their approaches to managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. Enterprises may define explicit roles to bridge and integrate these processes as a part of an enterprise's broader risk management activities. This orchestrated approach is an integral part of an enterprise's effort to identify C-SCRM priorities, develop solutions, and incorporate C-SCRM into overall risk management decisions. Enterprises should perform C-SCRM activities as a part of the acquisition, SDLC, and broader enterprise risk management processes. Embedded C-SCRM activities involve determining the criticality of functions and their dependency on the supplied products and services, identifying and assessing applicable risks, determining appropriate mitigating actions, documenting selected risk response actions, and monitoring performance of C-SCRM activities. As exposure to supply chain risk differs across (and sometimes within) enterprises, business and mission-specific strategies, and policies should set the tone and direction for C-SCRM across the enterprise.\n\nOrganizations should ensure that tailored C-SCRM plans are designed to:\n\n- Manage rather than eliminate risk as risk is integral to the pursuit of value;\n- Ensure that operations are able to adapt to constantly emerging or evolving threats;\n- Be responsive to changes within their own organization, programs, and the supporting information systems; and\n- Adjust to the rapidly evolving practices of the private sector's global ICT supply chain.",

The Business Case for C-SCRM# Current Page Raw OCR Text\n\nToday, every enterprise heavily relies on digital technology to fulfill its business and mission. Digital technology is comprised of ICT/OT products and is delivered through and supported by services. C-SCRM is a critical capability that every enterprise needs to have to address cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain that arise from the use of digital technology. The depth, extent, and maturity of a C-SCRM capability for each enterprise should be based on the uniqueness of its business or mission, enterprise-specific compliance requirements, operational environment, risk appetite, and risk tolerance.\n\n## Benefits of Establishing and Sustaining a C-SCRM Capability\n\nEstablishing and sustaining a C-SCRM capability creates a number of significant benefits:\n\n- An established C-SCRM program will enable enterprises to understand which critical assets are most susceptible to supply chain weaknesses and vulnerabilities.\n- C-SCRM reduces the likelihood of supply chain compromise by a cybersecurity threat by enhancing an enterprise's ability to effectively detect, respond, and recover from events that result in significant business disruptions should a C-SCRM compromise occur.\n- Operational and enterprise efficiencies are achieved through clear structure, purpose, and alignment with C-SCRM capabilities and the prioritization, consolidation, and streamlining of existing C-SCRM processes.\n- There is greater assurance that acquired products are of high quality, authentic, reliable, resilient, maintainable, secure, and safe.\n- There is greater assurance that suppliers, service providers, and the technology products and services that they provide are trustworthy and can be relied upon to meet performance requirements.\n\n## Importance of C-SCRM\n\nC-SCRM is fundamental to any effort to manage risk exposure arising from enterprise operations. Implementing C-SCRM processes and controls requires human, tooling, and infrastructure investments by acquirers and their developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. However, enterprises have finite resources to commit to establishing and deploying C-SCRM processes and controls.",

However, enterprises have finite resources to commit to establishing and deploying C-SCRM processes and controls.\n\nAs such, enterprises should carefully weigh the potential costs and benefits when making C-SCRM resource commitment decisions and make decisions based on a clear understanding of any risk exposure implications that could arise from a failure to commit the necessary resources to C-SCRM.\n\nWhile there are cost-benefit trade-offs that must be acknowledged, the need to better secure supply chains is an imperative for both government and the private sector. The passage of the 2018 SECURE Technology Act, the formation of the FASC, and the observations from the 2015 and 2019 Case Studies in Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management captured in NIST Interagency or Internal Report (NIST IR) 8276, Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management, point to a broad public and private sector consensus: C-SCRM capabilities are a critical.# and foundational component of any enterprise's risk posture.\n\n## 2.2.

Cybersecurity Risks Throughout Supply Chains\n\nCybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain refers to the potential for harm or compromise that arises from the cybersecurity risks posed by suppliers, their supply chains, and their products or services. Examples of these risks include:\n\n- Insiders working on behalf of a system integrator steal sensitive intellectual property, resulting in the loss of a major competitive advantage.\n- A company that designs and manufactures safety critical connected devices has leveraged a chipset in their design, which provides the hardware root of trust (RoT) for cybersecurity. However, the designer/supplier of the RoT chipset has implanted a backdoor, or malware to be leveraged in a future attack (e.g., FOCI from a foreign adversary), which could result in compromise of sensitive data with national security implications.\n- A proxy working on behalf of a nation-state inserts malicious software into supplier-provided product components used in systems sold to government agencies. A breach occurs and results in the loss of several government contracts.\n- A system integrator working on behalf of an agency reuses vulnerable code, leading to a breach of mission-critical data with national security implications.\n- An organized criminal enterprise introduces counterfeit products onto the market, resulting in a loss of customer trust and confidence.\n- A company is on contract to produce a critical component of a larger acquisition, but the company relabels products from an unvetted supplier. A critical component that cannot be trusted is deployed into operational systems, and there is no trustworthy supplier of replacement parts.\n\nRisks such as these are realized when threats in the cybersecurity supply chain exploit existing vulnerabilities. Figure 4 depicts supply chain cybersecurity risks resulting from the likelihood that relevant threats may exploit applicable vulnerabilities and the consequential potential impacts.",
  "Risks such as these are realized when threats in the cybersecurity supply chain exploit existing vulnerabilities. Figure 4 depicts supply chain cybersecurity risks resulting from the likelihood that relevant threats may exploit applicable vulnerabilities and the consequential potential impacts.\n\nSupply chain cybersecurity vulnerabilities may lead to persistent negative impacts on an enterprise's missions, ranging from a reduction in service levels leading to customer dissatisfaction to the theft of intellectual property or the degradation of critical mission and business processes. It may, however, take years for such vulnerabilities to be exploited or discovered. It may also be difficult to determine whether an event was the direct result of a supply chain vulnerability. Vulnerabilities in the supply chain are often interconnected and may expose enterprises to cascading cybersecurity risks. For example, a large-scale service outage at a major cloud services provider may cause service or production disruptions for multiple entities within an enterprise's supply chain and lead to negative effects within multiple mission.# and business processes.\n\n## 2.3. Multilevel Risk Management\n\nTo integrate risk management throughout an enterprise, it describes three levels, depicted in Fig. 5, that address risk from different perspectives: 1) the enterprise level, 2) the mission and business process level, and 3) the operational level. C-SCRM requires the involvement of all three levels.\n\nIn multilevel risk management, the C-SCRM process is seamlessly carried out across the three tiers with the overall objective of continuous improvement in the enterprise's risk-related activities and effective inter- and intra-level communication among stakeholders with a vested interest in C-SCRM.\n\nC-SCRM activities can be performed by a variety of individuals or groups within an enterprise, ranging from a single individual to committees, divisions, centralized program offices, or any other enterprise structure. C-SCRM activities are distinct for different enterprises depending on their structure, culture, mission, and many other factors. C-SCRM activities at each of the three levels include the production of different high-level C-SCRM deliverables.",

These plans are heavily influenced by the context and direction provided by Level 2.\n\nFigure 6 provides an overview of the multilevel risk management structure and the associated strategies, policies, and plans developed at each level.

The C-SCRM team```markdown\n# C-SCRM Team Collaboration\n\nShould work together to make decisions and take actions deriving from the input and involvement of multiple perspectives and expertise. The team leverages but does not replace those C-SCRM responsibilities and processes that should be specifically assigned to an individual enterprise or disciplinary area. Effective implementations of C-SCRM often include the adoption of a shared responsibility model, which distributes responsibilities and accountabilities for C-SCRM-related activities and risk across a diverse group of stakeholders.\n\n## Examples of C-SCRM Activities\n\nExamples of C-SCRM activities in which enterprises benefit from a multidisciplinary approach include developing a strategic sourcing strategy, incorporating C-SCRM requirements into a solicitation, and determining options for how best to mitigate an identified supply chain risk, especially one assessed to be significant.\n\n## Composition of the C-SCRM Team\n\nMembers of the C-SCRM team should be a diverse group of people involved in the various aspects of the enterprise's critical processes, such as information security, procurement, enterprise risk management, engineering, software development, IT, legal, and HR. To aid in C-SCRM, these individuals should provide expertise in enterprise processes and practices specific to their discipline area and an understanding of the technical aspects and inter-dependencies of systems or information flowing through systems. The C-SCRM team may be an extension of an enterprise's existing enterprise risk management function, grown as part of an enterprise's cybersecurity risk management function, or operate out of a different department.\n\n## Breaking Down Barriers",

Many enterprises begin this process from the top by establishing a working group or council of senior leaders with representation from the necessary and appropriate functional areas. A charter should be established outlining the goals, objectives, authorities, meeting cadences, and responsibilities of the working group.\n\nOnce this council is formed, decisions can be made on how to operationalize the interdisciplinary approach at mission and business process and operational levels. This often takes the form of working groups that consist of mission and business process representatives who can meet at more regular cadences and address more operational and tactically focused C-SCRM challenges.\n\n## Summary of C-SCRM Stakeholders\n\nTable 1 shows a summary of C-SCRM stakeholders for each level with the specific C-SCRM activities performed within the corresponding level. These activities are either direct C-SCRM activities or have an impact on C-SCRM.\n\n## Continuous Improvement\n\nThe C-SCRM process should be carried out across the three risk management levels with the overall objective of continuous improvement of the enterprise's risk-related activities and effective inter- and intra-level communication, thus integrating both strategic and tactical activities among all stakeholders with a shared interest in the mission.\n```# Business Success of the Enterprise",

Level 1 \u2013 Enterprise\n\nEffective C-SCRM requires commitment, direct involvement, and ongoing support from senior leaders and executives. Enterprises should designate the responsibility for leading agency-wide SCRM activities to an executive-level individual, office (supported by an expert staff), or group (e.g., a risk board, executive steering committee, or executive leadership council) regardless of an agency's specific organizational structure. Because cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain can be present across every major business line, enterprises should ensure that C-SCRM roles and responsibilities are defined for senior leaders who participate in supply chain activities (e.g., acquisition and procurement, information security, information technology, legal, program management, and supply chain and logistics). Without establishing executive oversight of C-SCRM activities, enterprises are limited in their ability to make risk decisions across the organization about how to effectively secure their product and services.",

Without establishing executive oversight of C-SCRM activities, enterprises are limited in their ability to make risk decisions across the organization about how to effectively secure their product and services.\n\nLevel 1 (Enterprise) sets the tone and direction for enterprise-wide C-SCRM activities by providing an overarching C-SCRM strategy, a C-SCRM policy, and a High-level Implementation Plan that shapes how C-SCRM is implemented across the enterprise. Within Level-1, governance structures are formed to enable senior leaders and executives to collaborate on C-SCRM with the risk executive (function), make C-SCRM decisions, delegate decisions to Level 2 and Level 3, and prioritize enterprise-wide resource allocation for C-SCRM. Level 1 activities help to ensure that C-SCRM mitigation strategies are consistent with the strategic goals and objectives of the enterprise. Level 1 activities culminate in the C-SCRM Strategy, Policy, and High-Level Implementation Plan that shape and constrain how C-SCRM is carried out at Level 2 and Level 3.# Ownership and Accountability for Cybersecurity Risks in the Supply Chain\n\nOwnership and accountability for cybersecurity risks in the supply chain ultimately lie with the head of the organization.\n\n- Decision-makers are informed by an organization's risk profile, risk appetite, and risk tolerance levels.

This is generally achieved through an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) council. Effective C-SCRM gathers perspectives from leaders, all generally within the ERM council \u2013 such as the chief executive officer (CEO), chief risk officer (CRO), chief information officer (CIO), chief legal officer (CLO)/general counsel, chief information security officer (CISO), and chief acquisition officer (CAO) \u2013 and informs advice and recommendations from the CIO and CISO to the executive board.\n\nCIOs and/or CISOs may form a C-SCRM oriented body to provide in-depth analysis to inform the executive board's ERM council.

The best C-SCRM governance and operating model is one that meets the business and functional requirements of the enterprise.\n\nFor example, an enterprise facing strict budgetary constraints or stiff C-SCRM requirements may consider governance and operational models that centralize the decision-making authority and rely on a C-SCRM PMO to consolidate responsibilities for resource-intensive tasks, such as vendor risk assessments.

C-SCRM framing is the process by which the enterprise makes explicit the assumptions about cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain (e.g., threats, vulnerabilities, risk impact, risk likelihood), constraints (e.g., enterprise policies, regulations, resource limitation), appetite and tolerance, and priorities and trade-offs that guide C-SCRM decisions across the enterprise.\n\nThe risk framing process provides the inputs necessary to establish the C-SCRM strategy that dictates how the enterprise plans to assess, respond to, and monitor cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. A high-level implementation plan should also be developed to guide the execution of the enterprise's C-SCRM strategy. The risk framing process is discussed in further detail in Appendix C.\n\n## C-SCRM Policy\n\nInformed by the risk framing process and the C-SCRM strategy, Level 1 provides the enterprise's C-SCRM policy.

Risk exposures to the supply chain may occur as a result of primary dependencies on the supply chain or secondary dependencies on individual information systems or other mission and business processes. For example, risk exposure may arise due to a supplier providing critical system components or services to multiple information systems on which critical processes depend. Risk may also arise from vendor-sourced products and services unrelated to information systems, as well as the roles that these products and services play in the overall mission and business process objectives. Enterprises should consider non-traditional sources of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. These risks may circumvent or escape C-SCRM processes, such as those arising from the use of open source software. Enterprises should establish policies and controls to manage non-traditional cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.\n\n## Reporting at Level 2\n\nReporting at Level 2 plays an important role in equipping mission and business process leaders with the context necessary to manage C-SCRM within the scope of their mission and business processes.

Level 3 C-SCRM activities begin with an analysis of the likelihood and impact of potential supply chain cybersecurity threats exploiting an operational-level vulnerability (e.g., in a system or system component). Where applicable, these risk assessments should be informed by risk assessments completed in Level 1 and Level 2.\n\n## Risk Evaluation\n\nIn response to determining risk, enterprises should evaluate alternative courses of action for reducing risk exposure (e.g., accept, avoid, mitigate, share, and/or transfer). Risk response is achieved by selecting, tailoring, implementing, and monitoring C-SCRM controls throughout the SLDC in accordance with the RMF [SP80037]. Selected C-SCRM controls often consist of a combination of inherited common controls from the Level 1 and Level 2 and information system-specific controls at Level 3.\n\n## Reporting at Level 3\n\nReporting at Level 3 should focus on the C-SCRM's implementation, efficiency, effectiveness, and the overall level of exposure to cybersecurity risks in the supply chain for the particular system. System-level reporting should provide system owners with tactical-level insights that enable them to make rapid adjustments and respond to risk conditions. Level 3 reporting should include metrics that demonstrate performance against the enterprise risk appetite statements and risk tolerance statements defined at Levels 1, 2, and 3.\n\n## Critical Level 3 Activity\n\nA critical Level 3 activity is the development of the C-SCRM plan.

In C-SCRM, continuous hygiene is critical, and the C-SCRM plan is a living document that should be maintained and used as the reference for the continuous monitoring of implemented C-SCRM controls. C-SCRM plans are intended to be referenced regularly and should be reviewed and refreshed periodically. These are not intended to be documents developed to satisfy a compliance requirement. Rather, enterprises should be able to demonstrate how they have historically and continue to effectively employ their plans to shape, align, inform, and take C-SCRM actions and decisions across all three levels. Information gathered as part of Level 3 C-SCRM activities should iteratively inform C-SCRM activities completed within Level 1 and Level 2 to further refine C-SCRM strategies and implementation plans.\n\nAdditional information can be found in Appendix A of this document and SR-1, SR-2, SR-6, PL-2, PM-31, and PM-32 of NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5.\n\n## 2.3.5.

Critical Success Factors\nTo successfully address evolving cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, enterprises need to engage multiple internal processes and capabilities, communicate and collaborate across enterprise levels and mission areas, and ensure that all individuals within the enterprise understand their role in managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. Enterprises need strategies for communicating, determining how best to implement, and monitoring the effectiveness of their supply chain cybersecurity controls and practices. In addition to internally communicating cybersecurity supply chain risk management controls, enterprises should engage with peers to exchange C-SCRM insights. These insights will aid enterprises in continuously evaluating how well they are doing and identify where they need to improve and how to take steps to mature their C-SCRM program. This section addresses the requisite enterprise processes and capabilities in making C-SCRM successful. While this publication has chosen to highlight these critical success factors, this represents a non-exhaustive set of factors that contribute to an enterprise's successful execution of C-SCRM.

  "Success factors are fluid and will evolve over time as the environment and the enterprise's own capability advances.\n\n## 3.1. C-SCRM in Acquisition\n\nIntegrating C-SCRM considerations into acquisition activities within every step of the procurement and contract management life cycle process is essential to improving management of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. This life cycle begins with a purchaser identifying a need and includes the processes to plan for and articulate requirements, conduct research to identify and assess viable sources of supply, solicit bids, evaluate offers to ensure conformance with C-SCRM requirements, and assess C-SCRM risks associated with the bidder and the proposed product and/or service. After contract award, ensure that the supplier satisfies the terms and conditions articulated in the contractual agreement and that the products and services conform as expected and required. Monitoring for changes that may affect cybersecurity risks in the supply chain should occur throughout the life cycle and may trigger reevaluation of the original assessment or require a mitigation response.\n\nEnterprises rely heavily on commercial products and outsourced services to perform operations and fulfill their mission and business objectives. However, it is important to highlight that products and services can also be obtained outside of the procurement process, as is the case with open source software, relying on an in-house provider for shared services, or by repurposing an existing product to satisfy a new need. C-SCRM must also be addressed for these other \"acquiring\" processes.\n\nIn addition to addressing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and performing C-SCRM activities during each phase of the acquisition process, enterprises should develop and execute an acquisition strategy that drives reductions in their overall risk exposure. By applying such strategies, enterprises can reduce cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, within specific procurement processes, and for the overall enterprise. Enterprises will aid, direct, and inform efforts to realize targeted risk-reducing outcomes by adopting acquisition policies and processes that integrate C-SCRM into acquisition activities.",

Enterprises will aid, direct, and inform efforts to realize targeted risk-reducing outcomes by adopting acquisition policies and processes that integrate C-SCRM into acquisition activities.\n\nAdditionally, by adopting C-SCRM controls aligned to an industry-recognized set of standards and guidelines (e.g., NIST 800-53, Rev.5; NIST CSF), the enterprise can ensure holistic coverage of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and corresponding C-SCRM practices. C-SCRM controls may apply to different participants of the supply chain to include the enterprise itself, prime contractors, and subcontractors. Because enterprises heavily rely on prime contractors and their subcontractors to develop, implement, operate and maintain ICT/OT products and services, those controls implemented within the SDLC are likely to flow down to subcontractors. Establishing C-SCRM controls applicable throughout the supply chain is crucial.\n```# Chain and the SDLC\n\nThe SDLC will aid the enterprise in establishing a common lexicon and set of expectations with suppliers and sub-suppliers to aid all participants in managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.\n\n## 3.1.1.

  "The SDLC will aid the enterprise in establishing a common lexicon and set of expectations with suppliers and sub-suppliers to aid all participants in managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.\n\n## 3.1.1. Acquisition in the C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan\n\nAn enterprise's C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan guides the enterprise toward the achievement of long-term, sustainable reductions in exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. As a core part of the C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan, enterprises should address how this risk is managed throughout the acquisition process. Cybersecurity risks in the supply chain include those arising from the supplier's enterprise, products, services, and the supplier's own suppliers and supply chains. The C-SCRM PMO may be helpful in developing specific strategies and implementation plans for integrating C-SCRM considerations into acquisitions.\n\nAcquisition activities relevant to C-SCRM include:\n\n- Promoting awareness and communicating C-SCRM expectations as part of supplier relationship management efforts\n- Establishing a checklist of acquisition security requirements that must be completed as part of procurement requests to ensure that necessary provision and protections are in place\n- Leveraging an external shared service provider or utilizing the C-SCRM PMO to provide supplier, product, and/or service assessment activities as a shared service to other internal processes, including acquisition\n- Conducting due diligence to inform determinations about a bidder's responsibility and to identify and assess bidders' risk posture or risk associated with a given product or service\n- Obtaining open source software from vetted and approved libraries\n- Including C-SCRM criteria in source selection evaluations\n- Establishing and referencing a list of prohibited suppliers, if appropriate, per applicable regulatory and legal references\n- Establishing and procuring from an approved products list or list of preferred or qualified suppliers who have demonstrated conformance with the enterprise's security requirements through a rigorous process defined by the enterprise or another acceptable qualified list program activity\n- Ensuring that products, including software or logic-bearing products (i.e., hardware), are supplied with a software bill of materials that complies with appropriate agency-approved protocols",
  "The C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan should address the acquisition security-relevant foundational elements necessary to implement a C-SCRM program. To support the strategy, enterprise leaders should promote the value and importance of C-SCRM within acquisitions and ensure that sufficient, dedicated funding is in place for necessary activities. Doing so will help enterprises ensure responsibility for program or business processes and...# Accountability for Progress\n\nEnterprises should build sufficient time into acquisition and project activities to ensure that C-SCRM activities can be completed. Enterprises should also assign roles and responsibilities, some of which will be cross-enterprise in nature and team-based, while others will be specific to acquisition processes. Finally, relevant training should be provided to members of the acquisition workforce to ensure that roles and responsibilities are understood and executed in alignment with leader expectations.\n\n## Baseline Context\n\nThe enterprise's capabilities, resources, operational constraints, and existing portfolio of supplier relationships, contracts, acquired services, and products provide the baseline context necessary to lay out a strategic path that is both realistic and achievable. This baseline starting point also serves as a marker by which performance progress and outcomes can be tracked and assessed.\n\n## Inventory of Supplier Relationships\n\nA critical first step is to ensure that there is a current and accurate inventory of the enterprise's supplier relationships, contracts, and any products or services those suppliers provide. This information allows for a mapping of these suppliers into strategically relevant groupings as determined by the organization. For example, an assessment of these suppliers might result in groupings of multiple categories (e.g., \"strategic/innovative,\" \"mission-critical,\" \"sustaining,\" or \"standard/non-essential\"). This segmentation facilitates further analysis and understanding of the exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and helps to focus attention and assign priority to those critical suppliers of the most strategic or operational importance to the enterprise and its mission and business processes.\n\nIt is useful to identify which products and services require a higher level of confidence in risk mitigation and areas of risk, such as overreliance on a single source of supply. This inventory and mapping also facilitates the selection and tailoring of C-SCRM contract language and evaluation criteria. Additional information can be found in Appendix A of this document and SA-1, SA-2, SA-4, SR-5, SR-13 of NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5.\n\n## 3.1.2. The Role of C-SCRM in the Acquisition Process",

This includes program officials, personnel with technical and security expertise, and representatives from supply and procurement communities.\n\nWhile procurement requirements address and are tailored to a specific purpose and ensuring that compliance mandates are met, contextual factors such as mission criticality, the sensitivity of data, and the operational environment must also be considered to effectively address cybersecurity risk in supply chains.

The program office or requiring official should consult with information security personnel to complete this control selection process and work with their procurement official to incorporate these controls into requirements documents and contracts.\n\n## Security in Procurement Decisions\n\nSecurity is a critical factor in procurement decisions. For this reason, when purchasing ICT/OT related products or services, enterprises should avoid using a \"lowest price, technically acceptable\" (LPTA) source selection process.\n\n## Incorporating C-SCRM Considerations\n\nAcquisition policies and processes need to incorporate C-SCRM considerations into each step of the procurement and contract management life cycle management process (i.e., plan procurement, define and develop requirements, perform market analysis, complete procurement, ensure compliance, and monitor performance for changes that affect C-SCRM risk status) as described in [IR7622].

This includes ensuring that cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain are addressed when making ICT/OT-related charge card purchases.\n\n## Planning Procurement\n\nDuring the 'plan procurement' step, the need for and the criticality of the good or service to be procured needs to be identified, along with a description of the factors driving the determination of the need and level of criticality as this informs how much risk may be tolerated, who should be involved in the planning, and the development of the specific requirements that will need to be satisfied. This activity is typically led by the acquirer mission and business process owner or a designee in collaboration with the procurement official or contracting officer representative.\n\n## Developing Requirements\n\nDuring the planning phase, the enterprise should develop and define requirements to address cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain in addition to specifying performance, schedule, and cost objectives.

Finally, enterprises should continuously apply lessons learned and collected during the acquisition process to enhance their ability to assess, respond to, and monitor cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.\n\nIn addition to process activities, there are many useful acquisition security-enhancing tools and techniques available, including obscuring the system end use or system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results of a supply chain cybersecurity risk assessment can guide and inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation.

The type and rigor of the required methods should be commensurate with the criticality of the service or product being acquired and the corresponding assurance requirements.\n\nAdditional guidance for integrating C-SCRM into the acquisition process is provided in Appendix C, which demonstrates the enhanced overlay of C-SCRM into the [SP80039] Risk Management Process. In addition, enterprises should refer to and follow the acquisition and procurement policies, regulations, and best practices that are specific to their domain (e.g., critical infrastructure sector, state government).",

Supply Chain Information Sharing\n\nEnterprises are continuously exposed to risk originating from their supply chains. An effective information-sharing process helps to ensure that enterprises can gain access to information that is critical to understanding and mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and also share relevant information with others that may benefit from or require awareness of these risks.\n\nTo aid in identifying, assessing, monitoring, and responding to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, enterprises should build information-sharing processes and activities into their C-SCRM programs. This may include establishing information-sharing agreements with peer enterprises, business partners, and suppliers. By exchanging Supply Chain Risk Information (SCRI) within a sharing community, enterprises can leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and capabilities of that sharing community to gain a more complete understanding of the threats that the enterprise may face. Additionally, the sharing of SCRI allows enterprises.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nTo better detect campaigns that target specific industry sectors and institutions.

It may exist in various forms (e.g., raw data, a supply chain network map, risk assessment report) and should be accompanied by the metadata that will facilitate an assessment of a level of confidence in and credibility of the information. Enterprises should follow established processes and procedures that describe whether and when the sharing or reporting of certain information is mandated or voluntary and if there are any necessary requirements to adhere to regarding information handling, protection, and classification.\n\n## 3.3.

C-SCRM Key Practices are meant to specifically emphasize and draw attention to a subset of the C-SCRM practices described throughout this publication. Enterprises should prioritize achieving a base-level of maturity in these key practices prior to advancing on to additional C-SCRM capabilities. Enterprises should tailor their implementation of these practices to what is applicable and appropriate given their unique context (e.g., based on available resources and risk profile). C-SCRM Key Practices are described in NIST standards and guidelines, such as and other applicable national and international standards. C-SCRM Practices include integrating C-SCRM across the enterprise; establishing a formal program; knowing and managing critical products, services, and suppliers; understanding an enterprise's supply chain; closely collaborating with critical suppliers; including critical suppliers in resilience and improvement activities; assessing and monitoring throughout the supplier relationship; and planning for the full life cycle.\n\n### 3.4.1.

Major benefits include increasing stakeholder accountability for C-SCRM performance; improving the effectiveness of C-SCRM activities; demonstrating compliance with laws, rules, and regulations; providing quantifiable inputs for resource allocation decisions; and cost-avoidance associated with reduced impact from or the likelihood of experiencing a cyber supply chain incident.\n\nEnterprises can use a framework to baseline their C-SCRM capabilities, such as NIST CSF Implementation Tiers, which provide a useful context for an enterprise to track and gauge the increasing rigor and sophistication of their C-SCRM practices. Progression against framework topics is measured using ordinal (i.e., 1-5) scales that illustrate the progression of capabilities across tiers. The following are examples of how C-SCRM capabilities could be gauged by applying NIST CSF Tiers:\n\n- **CSF Tier 1**: The enterprise does not understand its exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain or its role in the larger ecosystem. The enterprise does not collaborate with other entities or have processes in place to identify, assess, and...# Mitigating Cybersecurity Risks Throughout the Supply Chain\n\n## CSF Tier 2\nThe enterprise understands its cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and its role in the larger ecosystem.

The enterprise has not internally formalized its capabilities to manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain or its capability to engage and share information with entities in the broader ecosystem.\n\n## CSF Tier 3\nThe enterprise-wide approach to managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain is enacted via enterprise risk management policies, processes, and procedures. This likely includes a governance structure (e.g., Risk Council) that balances the management of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain with other enterprise risks. Policies, processes, and procedures are consistently implemented as intended and continuously monitored and reviewed. Personnel possess the knowledge and skills to perform their appointed cybersecurity supply chain risk management responsibilities. The enterprise has formal agreements in place to communicate baseline requirements to its suppliers and partners. The enterprise understands its external dependencies and collaborates with partners to share information to enable risk-based management decisions within the enterprise in response to events.\n\n## CSF Tier 4\nThe enterprise actively consumes and distributes information with partners and uses real-time or near real-time information to improve cybersecurity and supply chain security before an event occurs. The enterprise leverages institutionalized knowledge of cybersecurity supply chain risk management with its external suppliers and partners, internally in related functional areas, and at all levels of the enterprise. The enterprise communicates proactively using formal (e.g., agreements) and informal mechanisms to develop and maintain strong relationships with its suppliers, buyers, and other partners.\n\nBuilding capabilities begins by establishing a solid programmatic foundation that includes enabling strategies and plans, establishing policies and guidance, investment in training, and dedicating program resources.

When developing C-SCRM measures, enterprises should focus on the stakeholder's highest priorities and target measures based on data that can be realistically sourced and gathered. Each established measure should have a specified performance target used to gauge whether goals and objectives in relation to that measure are being met. Enterprises should consider the use of measures templates to formalize each measure and serve as a source of reference for all information pertaining to that measure. Finally, enterprises should develop a formal feedback loop with stakeholders to ensure that measures are continually providing the desired insights and remain aligned with the enterprise's overall strategic objectives for C-SCRM.\n\n## 3.6. Dedicated Resources\nTo appropriately manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain,# Funding for C-SCRM Efforts\n\nEnterprises should dedicate funds toward this effort. Identifying resource needs and taking steps to secure adequate, recurring, and dedicated funding are essential and important activities that need to be built into the C-SCRM strategy and implementation planning effort and incorporated into an enterprise's budgeting, investment review, and funds management processes. Access to adequate resources is a critical, key enabler for the establishment and sustainment of a C-SCRM program capability. Where feasible, enterprises should be encouraged to leverage existing fund sources to improve their C-SCRM posture. The continued availability of dedicated funds will allow enterprises to sustain, expand, and mature their capabilities over time.",

Where feasible, enterprises should be encouraged to leverage existing fund sources to improve their C-SCRM posture. The continued availability of dedicated funds will allow enterprises to sustain, expand, and mature their capabilities over time.\n\nSecuring and assigning C-SCRM funding is representative of leadership's commitment to the importance of C-SCRM, its relevance to national and economic security, and ensuring the protection, continuity, and resilience of mission and business processes and assets. Funding facilitates goal and action-oriented planning. Examining resource needs and allocating funding prompts a budgeting and strategic-planning process. Effective enterprises begin by defining a set of goals and objectives upon which to build a strategic roadmap, laying out the path to achieving them through the assignment and allocation of finite resources. The establishment of dedicated funding tied to C-SCRM objectives sets conditions for accountability of performance and compels responsible staff to be efficient, effective, and adopt a mindset of continuously seeking to improve C-SCRM capabilities and achieve security-enhancing outcomes.\n\nObtaining new or increased funding can be a challenge as resources are often scarce and necessary for many competing purposes. The limited nature of funds forces prioritization. C-SCRM leaders need to first examine what can be accomplished within the constraints of existing resources and be able to articulate, prioritize, and defend their requests for additional resources. For new investment proposals, this requires a reconciliation of planned initiatives against the enterprise's mission and business objectives. When well-executed, a systematic planning process can tighten the alignment of C-SCRM processes to these objectives.",

For new investment proposals, this requires a reconciliation of planned initiatives against the enterprise's mission and business objectives. When well-executed, a systematic planning process can tighten the alignment of C-SCRM processes to these objectives.\n\nMany C-SCRM processes can and should be built into existing program and operational activities and may be adequately performed using available funds. However, there may be a need for an influx of one-time resources to establish an initial C-SCRM program capability. For example, this might include the need to hire new personnel with expertise in C-SCRM, acquire contractor support to aid in developing C-SCRM program guidance, or develop content for role-based C-SCRM training. There may also be insufficient resources in place to satisfy all recurring C-SCRM program needs. Existing funds may need to be reallocated toward C-SCRM efforts or new or additional funds requested. Enterprises should also seek out opportunities to leverage.# Shared Services in C-SCRM\n\nThe use of shared services can optimize the use of scarce resources and concentrate capability into centers of excellence that provide cost-efficient access to services, systems, or tools. Enterprises can adopt cost-sharing mechanisms across their lower-level entities that allow cost-efficient access to C-SCRM resources and capabilities.\n\n## Challenges of Shared Services\n\nEnterprises that pursue shared-services models for C-SCRM should also be aware of the challenges of such models. Shared services (e.g., C-SCRM PMO) are most effective when the enterprise at large relies on a fairly homogenous set of C-SCRM strategies, policies, and processes. In many instances, the centralized delivery of C-SCRM services requires a robust technology infrastructure. The enterprise's systems should be able to support process automation and centralized delivery in order to fully realize the benefits of a shared-services model.\n\n## Consultation with Budget/Finance Officials",
  "The use of shared services can optimize the use of scarce resources and concentrate capability into centers of excellence that provide cost-efficient access to services, systems, or tools. Enterprises can adopt cost-sharing mechanisms across their lower-level entities that allow cost-efficient access to C-SCRM resources and capabilities.\n\n## Challenges of Shared Services\n\nEnterprises that pursue shared-services models for C-SCRM should also be aware of the challenges of such models. Shared services (e.g., C-SCRM PMO) are most effective when the enterprise at large relies on a fairly homogenous set of C-SCRM strategies, policies, and processes. In many instances, the centralized delivery of C-SCRM services requires a robust technology infrastructure. The enterprise's systems should be able to support process automation and centralized delivery in order to fully realize the benefits of a shared-services model.\n\n## Consultation with Budget/Finance Officials\n\nConsultation with budget/finance officials is critical to understanding what options may be available and viable in the near term and out-years. These officials can also advise on how best to justify needs, as well as the timeframes and processes for requesting new funds. There are likely different processes to follow for securing recurring funds versus requesting one-time funding. For example, funding for a new information system to support a C-SCRM capability may involve the development of a formal business case presented to an enterprise's investment review board for approval.\n\nOrganizations may find it helpful to break out resource needs into ongoing and one-time costs or into cost categories that align with budget formulation, resource decision-making, and the allocation and management of available funds.\n\n## C-SCRM PMO Responsibilities\n\nIt is recommended that the C-SCRM PMO have the lead responsibility of coordinating with mission and business process and budget officials to build out and maintain a multi-year C-SCRM program budget that captures both recurring and non-recurring resource requirements and maps those requirements to available funding and fund sources.\n\nTo understand the amount of funding required, when, and for what purpose, enterprises should identify and assess which type and level of resources (people or things) are required to implement a C-SCRM program capability and perform required C-SCRM processes on an ongoing basis. The cost associated with each of these identified resource needs would then be captured, accumulated, and reflected in a budget that includes line items for relevant cost categories, such as personnel costs, contracts, training, travel, tools, or systems.",

The actual allocation of funds may be centralized in a single C-SCRM budget or dispersed across the enterprise and reflected in individual office or mission and business process-area budgets. Regardless of how funds are actually assigned, a# Centralized C-SCRM Budget and Funds Status\n\nA centralized picture of the C-SCRM budget and funds status will provide a valuable source of information that justifies new requests, informs prioritization decisions, and adjusts expectations about certain activities and the duration in which they can be accomplished.\n\nEnsuring that C-SCRM program funding is distinctly articulated within the enterprise's budget\u2014with performance measures linked to the funding\u2014will drive accountability for results. The visible dedication of funds in budget requests, performance plans, and reports compels leadership attention on C-SCRM processes and the accomplishment of objectives. Budgets must be requested and justified on a periodic basis. This process allows leadership and oversight officials to trace and measure the effectiveness and efficiency of allocated resources. This, in turn, serves as a driving function for program and operational C-SCRM personnel to track and manage their performance.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n### C-SCRM in Acquisition\n\nThe integration of C-SCRM into acquisition activities is critical to the success of any C-SCRM program. C-SCRM requirements should be embedded throughout the acquisition life cycle. The C-SCRM activities include performing risk assessments of services, suppliers, and products; identifying relevant C-SCRM controls; conducting due diligence; and continuously monitoring suppliers.\n\n### Supply Chain Information Sharing",
  "## Key Takeaways\n\n### C-SCRM in Acquisition\n\nThe integration of C-SCRM into acquisition activities is critical to the success of any C-SCRM program. C-SCRM requirements should be embedded throughout the acquisition life cycle. The C-SCRM activities include performing risk assessments of services, suppliers, and products; identifying relevant C-SCRM controls; conducting due diligence; and continuously monitoring suppliers.\n\n### Supply Chain Information Sharing\n\nEnterprises will gain access to information critical to understanding and mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain by building information-sharing processes and activities into C-SCRM programs. Enterprises should engage with peers, business partners, suppliers, and information-sharing communities (e.g., ISACs) to gain insight into cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and learn from the experiences of the community at large.\n\n### C-SCRM Awareness and Training\n\nEnterprises should adopt enterprise-wide and role-based training programs to educate users on the potential impact that cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain can have on the business and how to adopt best practices for risk mitigation. Robust C-SCRM training is a key enabler for enterprises as they shift toward a C-SCRM-aware culture.\n\n### C-SCRM Key Practices\n\nThis publication outlines several foundational, sustaining, and enabling C-SCRM practices that enterprises should adopt and tailor to their unique contexts. Enterprises should prioritize reaching a base level of maturity in key practices before focusing on advanced C-SCRM capabilities.\n\n### Capability Implementation Measurement and C-SCRM Measures\n\nEnterprises should actively manage the efficiency and effectiveness of their C-SCRM programs. First, enterprises should adopt a C-SCRM framework as the basis for measuring their progress toward C-SCRM objectives. Next, enterprises should create and implement quantitative performance measures and target tolerance that provide a periodic glimpse into the enterprise's progress through the lens of specific operational objectives.\n\n### Dedicated Resources\n\nWhere possible and applicable, enterprises should commit dedicated funds to C-SCRM. The benefits of doing so include facilitating strategic and goal-oriented planning, driving accountability of internal stakeholders to execute and mature the C-SCRM practices of the enterprise, and the continuous monitoring of progress by enterprise leadership."
