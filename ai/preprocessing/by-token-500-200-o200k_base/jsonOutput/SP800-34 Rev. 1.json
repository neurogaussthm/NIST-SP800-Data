  "# Executive Summary\n\nNIST Special Publication 800-34, Rev. 1, Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems, provides instructions, recommendations, and considerations for federal information system contingency planning. Contingency planning refers to interim measures to recover information system services after a disruption. Interim measures may include relocation of information systems and operations to an alternate site, recovery of information system functions using alternate equipment, or performance of information system functions using manual methods. This guide addresses specific contingency planning recommendations for three platform types and provides strategies and techniques common to all systems.\n\n- Client/server systems;\n- Telecommunications systems; and\n- Mainframe systems.\n\nThis guide defines the following seven-step contingency planning process that an organization may apply to develop and maintain a viable contingency planning program for their information systems. These seven progressive steps are designed to be integrated into each stage of the system development life cycle.\n\n1. **Develop the contingency planning policy statement.** A formal policy provides the authority and guidance necessary to develop an effective contingency plan.\n2. **Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA).** The BIA helps identify and prioritize information systems and components critical to supporting the organization's mission/business processes. A template for developing the BIA is provided to assist the user.\n3. **Identify preventive controls.** Measures taken to reduce the effects of system disruptions can increase system availability and reduce contingency life cycle costs.\n4. **Create contingency strategies.** Thorough recovery strategies ensure that the system may be recovered quickly and effectively following a disruption.\n5. **Develop an information system contingency plan.** The contingency plan should contain detailed guidance and procedures for restoring a damaged system unique to the system's security impact level and recovery requirements.\n6. **Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises.** Testing validates recovery capabilities, whereas training prepares recovery personnel for plan activation and exercising the plan identifies planning gaps; combined, the activities improve plan effectiveness and overall organization preparedness.\n7. **Ensure plan maintenance.** The plan should be a living document that is updated regularly to remain current with system enhancements and organizational changes.",
  "This guide presents three sample formats for developing an information system contingency plan based on low-, moderate-, or high-impact level, as defined by Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. Each format defines three phases that govern actions to be taken following a system disruption. The Activation/Notification Phase describes the process of activating the plan based on outage impacts and```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nnotifying recovery personnel. The Recovery Phase details a suggested course of action for recovery teams to restore system operations at an alternate site or using contingency capabilities. The final phase, Reconstitution, includes activities to test and validate system capability and functionality and outlines actions that can be taken to return the system to normal operating condition and prepare the system against future outages.\n\n## Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nInformation systems are vital elements in most mission/business processes. Because information system resources are so essential to an organization's success, it is critical that identified services provided by these systems are able to operate effectively without excessive interruption. Contingency planning supports this requirement by establishing thorough plans, procedures, and technical measures that can enable a system to be recovered as quickly and effectively as possible following a service disruption. Contingency planning is unique to each system, providing preventive measures, recovery strategies, and technical considerations appropriate to the system's information confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements and the system impact level.\n\nThis document provides guidelines to individuals responsible for preparing and maintaining information system contingency plans (ISCPs). The document discusses essential contingency plan elements and processes, highlights specific considerations and concerns associated with contingency planning for various types of information system platforms, and provides examples to assist readers in developing their own ISCPs.\n\n- Restoring information systems using alternate equipment;\n- Performing some or all of the affected business processes using alternate processing (manual) means (typically acceptable for only short-term disruptions);\n- Recovering information systems operations at an alternate location (typically acceptable for only long-term disruptions or those physically impacting the facility); and\n- Implementing of appropriate contingency planning controls based on the information system's security impact level.\n\nInformation system contingency planning refers to a coordinated strategy involving plans, procedures, and technical measures that enable the recovery of information systems, operations, and data after a disruption. Contingency planning generally includes one or more of the following approaches to restore disrupted services:\n\n### 1.1 Purpose",

Contingency planning generally includes one or more of the following approaches to restore disrupted services:\n\n### 1.1 Purpose\n\nThis publication assists organizations in understanding the purpose, process, and format of ISCP development through practical, real-world guidelines. While the principles establish a baseline to meet most organizational needs, it is recognized that each organization may have additional requirements specific to its own operating environment. This guidance document provides background information on interrelationships between information system contingency planning and other types of security and emergency management-related contingency plans, organizational resiliency, and the system development.\n```# Life Cycle (SDLC)\n\nThe document provides guidance to help personnel evaluate information systems and operations to determine contingency planning requirements and priorities. Requirements from FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, security impact levels, and NIST Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations contingency planning controls are integrated throughout the guideline. Considerations for impact levels and associated security controls for contingency planning are presented to assist planners in developing the appropriate contingency planning strategy. Although the information presented in this document is largely independent of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, and applications, technical considerations specific to common information system platforms are addressed.\n\n## 1.2 Scope\n\nThis document is published by NIST as recommended guidelines for federal organizations. To assist personnel responsible for developing contingency plans, this document discusses common technologies that may be used to support contingency capabilities. Given the broad range of information system designs and configurations, as well as the rapid development and obsolescence of products and capabilities, the scope of the discussion is not intended to be comprehensive. Rather, the document describes technology practices to enhance an organization's information system contingency planning capabilities. These guidelines present contingency planning principles for the following common platform types:\n\n- Client/server systems;\n- Telecommunications systems; and\n- Mainframe systems.",

These guidelines present contingency planning principles for the following common platform types:\n\n- Client/server systems;\n- Telecommunications systems; and\n- Mainframe systems.\n\nThe document outlines planning principles for a wide variety of incidents that can affect information system operations. These range from minor incidents causing short-term disruptions to disasters that affect normal operations for an extended period. Because information systems vary in design and purpose, specific incident types and associated contingency measures are not addressed in this guide. Instead, a defined process is provided for identifying planning requirements needed to develop an effective contingency plan for any information system.\n\nThis document does not address facility-level information system planning (commonly referred to as a disaster recovery plan) or organizational mission continuity (commonly referred to as a continuity of operations [COOP] plan) except where it is required to restore information systems and their processing capabilities. Nor does this document address continuity of mission/business processes. Although information systems typically support mission/business processes, the processes also depend on a variety of other resources and capabilities not associated with information systems. Recovery of mission essential functions is addressed by COOP plans or business continuity plans. These plans are part of a suite of security and emergency management-related plans further described in.# Section 2.2.

Contingency planning is designed to mitigate the risk of system and service unavailability by providing effective and efficient solutions to enhance system availability.\n\nThis chapter discusses the ways in which federal information system contingency planning fits into an organization's larger risk management, security, and emergency preparedness programs (each of which is a key component in developing a resiliency program). Other types of emergency preparedness-related plans and their relationships to information system contingency planning are also described. Finally, the section discusses how integrating contingency planning principles throughout the SDLC promotes system compatibility and a cost-effective means to increase an organization's ability to respond quickly and effectively to a disruptive event.\n\n## 2.1 Contingency Planning and Resilience\n\nAn organization must have the ability to withstand all hazards and sustain its mission through environmental changes. These changes can be gradual, such as economic or mission changes, or sudden, as in a disaster event. Rather than just working to identify and mitigate threats, vulnerabilities, and risks, organizations can work toward building a resilient infrastructure, minimizing the impact of any disruption on mission essential functions.\n\nResilience is the ability to quickly adapt and recover from any known or unknown changes to the environment. Resiliency is not a process, but rather an end-state for.# Resilient Organizations\n\nThe goal of a resilient organization is to continue mission essential functions at all times during any type of disruption. Resilient organizations continually work to adapt to changes and risks that can affect their ability to continue critical functions. Risk management, contingency, and continuity planning are individual security and emergency management activities that can also be implemented in a holistic manner across an organization as components of a resiliency program.\n\n## Effective Contingency Planning",

Resilient organizations continually work to adapt to changes and risks that can affect their ability to continue critical functions. Risk management, contingency, and continuity planning are individual security and emergency management activities that can also be implemented in a holistic manner across an organization as components of a resiliency program.\n\n## Effective Contingency Planning\n\nEffective contingency planning begins with the development of an organization contingency planning policy and subjection of each information system to a business impact analysis (BIA). This facilitates prioritizing the systems and processes based on the FIPS 199 impact level and develops priority recovery strategies for minimizing loss. FIPS 199 provides guidelines on determining information and information system impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations and the nation through a formula that examines three security objectives: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n### Security Objectives\n\n- **Confidentiality** preserves authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.\n- **Integrity** guards against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity.\n- **Availability** ensures timely and reliable access to and use of information.\n\nThe impact for each security objective is determined to be high, moderate, or low, based on definitions provided in FIPS 199. The highest of the individual security objective impact levels are used to determine the overall information system security impact level.\n\n## Contingency Planning Considerations\n\nContingency planning considerations and strategies address the impact level of the availability security objective of information systems. Strategies for high-impact information systems should consider high-availability and redundancy options in their design. Options may include fully redundant load balanced systems at alternate sites, data mirroring, and offsite database replication. High-availability options are normally expensive to set up, operate, and maintain and should be considered only for those high-impact information systems categorized with a high-availability security objective. Lower-impact information systems may be able to use less expensive contingency options and tolerate longer downtimes for recovery or restoration of data.\n\n## Incorporating Security Controls",

Lower-impact information systems may be able to use less expensive contingency options and tolerate longer downtimes for recovery or restoration of data.\n\n## Incorporating Security Controls\n\nEffective contingency planning includes incorporating security controls early in the development of an information system, and maintaining these controls on an ongoing basis. NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 3, identifies nine Contingency Planning (CP) security controls for information systems. Not all controls are applicable to all systems. The FIPS 199 security categorization determines which controls apply to a particular system. For example, information systems that have availability as a security objective categorized as low-impact do not require alternate processing or storage sites, and information systems that have an availability security objective categorized as moderate-impact require compliance with only the first system backup control enhancements. Using the FIPS 199 security categorization allows for...# Tailoring of the CP Security Controls in NIST SP 800-53\n\nto those applicable to the appropriate security control baselines. Table 2-1 provides a summary of the CP controls from NIST SP 800-53 and their applicability to the security control baselines. Further details and descriptions of the contingency planning controls are provided in Appendix E.\n\nSeveral CP controls reference environmental controls, which are part of the NIST SP 800-53 Physical and Environmental Protection (PE) control family. Environmental controls considerations are only for the location or building that houses the information system. The environment includes the hardware and technology assets that support the information system. Section 3.3 of NIST SP 800-53 provides more information on environmental controls and their relationship to information systems.",

Section 3.3 of NIST SP 800-53 provides more information on environmental controls and their relationship to information systems.\n\nThere are options available to organizations to facilitate compliance with the CP controls. NIST SP 800-53 allows for compensating security controls to provide comparable protection for an information system to comply with the intent of a CP control. An organization may use a compensating security control in lieu of a CP control as long as there is justification for the use of the compensating control and willingness to accept the risk of the compensating control implementation. Further explanation of compensating security controls is available in Section 3.3 of NIST SP 800-53.\n\n## 2.2 Types of Plans\n\nInformation system contingency planning represents a broad scope of activities designed to sustain and recover critical system services following an emergency event. Information system contingency planning fits into a much broader security and emergency management effort that includes organizational and business process continuity, disaster recovery planning, and incident management. Ultimately, an organization would use a suite of plans to properly prepare response, recovery, and continuity activities for disruptions affecting the organization's information systems, mission/business processes, personnel, and the facility. Because there is an inherent relationship between an information system and the mission/business process it supports, there must be coordination between each plan during development and updates to ensure that recovery strategies and supporting resources neither negate each other nor duplicate efforts.",

Continuity planning normally applies to the mission/business itself; it concerns the ability to continue critical functions and processes during and after an emergency event. Contingency planning normally applies to information systems, and provides the steps needed to recover the operation of all or part of designated information systems at an existing or new location in an emergency. Cyber Incident Response Planning is a type of plan that normally focuses on detection, response, and recovery to a computer security incident or event.\n\nIn general, universally accepted definitions for information system contingency planning and the related planning areas have not been available. Occasionally, this leads to confusion.# Regarding the Actual Scope and Purpose of Various Types of Plans\n\nTo provide a common basis of understanding regarding information system contingency planning, this section identifies several other types of plans and describes their purpose and scope relative to information system contingency planning. Because of the lack of standard definitions for these types of plans, the scope of actual plans developed by organizations may vary from the descriptions below. This guide applies the descriptions and references in sections below to security and emergency management-related plans. The plans listed are in alphabetical order, and do not imply any order of importance.\n\n## 2.2.1 Business Continuity Plan (BCP)",

An example of a mission/business process may be an organization's payroll process or customer service process. A BCP may be written for mission/business processes within a single business unit or may address the entire organization's processes. The BCP may also be scoped to address only the functions deemed to be priorities. A BCP may be used for long-term recovery in conjunction with the COOP plan, allowing for additional functions to come online as resources or time allow. Because mission/business processes use information systems (ISs), the business continuity planner must coordinate with information system owners to ensure that the BCP expectations and IS capabilities are matched.\n\n## 2.2.2 Continuity of Operations (COOP) Plan\n\nCOOP focuses on restoring an organization's mission essential functions (MEF) at an alternate site and performing those functions for up to 30 days before returning to normal operations. Additional functions, or those at a field office level, may be addressed by a BCP. Minor threats or disruptions that do not require relocation to an alternate site are typically not addressed in a COOP plan.\n\n### Standard elements of a COOP plan include:\n- Program plans and procedures\n- Continuity communications\n- Risk management\n- Vital records management\n- Budgeting and acquisition of resources\n- Human capital\n- Essential functions\n- Test, training, and exercise\n- Order of succession\n- Devolution\n- Delegation of authority\n- Reconstitution\n- Continuity facilities",

A crisis communications plan is often developed by the organization responsible for public outreach. The plan provides various formats for communications appropriate to the incident. The crisis communications plan typically designates specific individuals as the only authority for answering questions from or providing information to the public regarding emergency response. It may also include procedures for disseminating reports to personnel on the status of the incident and templates for public press releases. The crisis communication plan procedures should be communicated to the organization's COOP and BCP planners to ensure that the plans include clear direction that only approved statements are released to the public by authorized officials.

A CIP plan is a set of policies and procedures that serve to protect and recover these national assets and mitigate risks and vulnerabilities. CIP plans define the roles and responsibilities for protection, develop partnerships and information sharing relationships, implement the risk management framework defined in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) - 7 for CIKR assets, and integrate federal, state and local emergency preparedness, protection, and resiliency of critical infrastructure.\n\n### 2.2.5 Cyber Incident Response Plan\nThe cyber incident response plan establishes procedures to address cyber attacks against an organization's information system(s). These procedures are designed to enable security personnel to identify, mitigate, and recover from malicious computer incidents, such as unauthorized access to a system or data, denial of service, or unauthorized changes to system hardware, software, or data (e.g.,# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nmalicious logic, such as a virus, worm, or Trojan horse). This plan may be included as an appendix of the BCP.\n\n## 2.2.6 Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)",

This plan may be included as an appendix of the BCP.\n\n## 2.2.6 Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)\n\nThe DRP applies to major, usually physical disruptions to service that deny access to the primary facility infrastructure for an extended period. A DRP is an information system-focused plan designed to restore operability of the target system, application, or computer facility infrastructure at an alternate site after an emergency. The DRP may be supported by multiple information system contingency plans to address recovery of impacted individual systems once the alternate facility has been established. A DRP may support a BCP or COOP plan by recovering supporting systems for mission/business processes or mission essential functions at an alternate location. The DRP only addresses information system disruptions that require relocation.\n\n## 2.2.7 Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP)\n\nAn ISCP provides established procedures for the assessment and recovery of a system following a system disruption. The ISCP provides key information needed for system recovery, including roles and responsibilities, inventory information, assessment procedures, detailed recovery procedures, and testing of a system. The ISCP differs from a DRP primarily in that the information system contingency plan procedures are developed for recovery of the system regardless of site or location. An ISCP can be activated at the system's current location or at an alternate site. In contrast, a DRP is primarily a site-specific plan developed with procedures to move operations of one or more information systems from a damaged or uninhabitable location to a temporary alternate location. Once the DRP has successfully transferred an information system site to an alternate site, each affected system would then use its respective ISCP to restore, recover, and test systems, and put them into operation.\n\n## 2.2.8 Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP)",

Such events include a fire, bomb threat, chemical release, domestic violence in the workplace, or a medical emergency. Shelter-in-place procedures for events requiring personnel to stay inside the building rather than evacuate are also addressed in an OEP. OEPs are developed at the facility level, specific to the geographic location and structural design of the building. General Services Administration (GSA)-owned facilities maintain plans based on the GSA OEP template. The facility OEP may be appended to the COOP or BCP, but is executed separately and as a first response to the incident. Aspects of planning for personnel safety and evacuation are discussed in Appendix D.\n\nError! Reference source not found. summarizes the types of plans.

Figure 2-1 shows the interrelationship of each plan as they are implemented to.# Chapter 3. Information System Contingency Planning Process\n\nThis section describes the process to develop and maintain an effective information system contingency plan. The process presented is common to all information systems. The seven steps in the process are:\n\n1. Develop the contingency planning policy;\n2. Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA);\n3. Identify preventive controls;\n4. Create contingency strategies;\n5. Develop an information system contingency plan;\n6. Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises; and\n7. Ensure plan maintenance.\n\nThese steps represent key elements in a comprehensive information system contingency planning capability. Developing contingency planning policy and performing system BIA(s) are accomplished early in the SDLC (see Appendix F) and before the systems are categorized in accordance with the RMF.\n\nSix of the seven planning process steps are discussed in this section. Because plan development represents the core of information system contingency planning, including the individual sections that compose the plan, plan development is addressed in Chapter 4. Responsibility for the planning process generally falls under the auspice of the Information System Contingency Plan Coordinator, or ISCP Coordinator, who is typically a functional or resource manager within the organization. The ISCP Coordinator develops the strategy in cooperation with other functional and resource managers associated with the system or the mission/business processes supported by the system. The ISCP Coordinator also typically manages development and execution of the contingency plan. All federal information systems must have a contingency plan. Figure 3-1 illustrates the contingency planning process.\n\n## 3.1 Develop the Contingency Planning Policy Statement\n\nTo be effective and to ensure that personnel fully understand the organization's contingency planning requirements, the contingency plan must be based on a clearly defined policy. The contingency planning policy statement should define the organization's overall contingency objectives and establish the organizational framework and responsibilities for system contingency planning. To be successful, senior management, most likely the CIO, must support a contingency program and be included in the process to develop the program policy. The policy must reflect the FIPS 199 impact levels and the contingency controls that each impact level establishes. Key policy elements are as follows:",

The procedures for execution of such a capability shall be documented in a formal contingency plan by the Information Systems Contingency Plan (ISCP) Coordinator and must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the ISCP Coordinator. The plan must account for the FIPS 199 security categorization (low, moderate, high) and comply with the appropriate security controls. The plan must assign specific responsibilities to designated staff or positions to facilitate the recovery and/or continuity of essential system functions. Resources necessary to ensure viability of the procedures must be acquired and maintained. Personnel responsible for target systems must be trained to execute contingency procedures. The plan recovery capabilities and personnel shall be tested annually to identify weaknesses of the capability.\n\n## Information System Contingency Plans\n\nAs information system contingency plans are developed during the Initiation phase of the SDLC, they should be coordinated with related organization-wide policies and programs, including information system security, physical security, human resources, system operations, and emergency preparedness functions. Information system contingency activities should be compatible with program requirements for these areas, and recovery personnel should coordinate with representatives from each area to remain aware of new or evolving policies, programs, or capabilities. The ISCPs must be written in coordination with other plans associated with each target system as part of organization-wide resilience strategy. Such plans include the following:",

Implementing the RMF on an information system encompasses a broad range of activities to identify, control, and mitigate risks. From the information system contingency planning perspective, the six steps in the RMF actively support the development, implementation, testing, and maintenance of an information system's contingency plan as it supports the mission of the organization.\n\n### 3.2 Conduct the Business Impact Analysis (BIA)\n\nThe BIA is a key step in implementing the CP controls in NIST SP 800-53 and in the contingency planning process overall. The BIA enables the ISCP Coordinator to characterize the system components, supported mission/business processes, and interdependencies. The BIA purpose is to correlate the system with the critical mission/business processes and services provided, and based on that information, characterize the consequences of a disruption. The ISCP Coordinator can use the BIA results to determine contingency planning requirements and priorities. Results from the BIA should be appropriately incorporated into the analysis and strategy development efforts for the organization's COOP, BCPs, and DRP. The BIA should be performed during the Initiation phase of the SDLC. As the system design evolves and components.```markdown\n# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT",

Priority levels can be established for sequencing recovery activities and resources.\n\nThe sample BIA process and data collection activities, outlined in this section and illustrated in Figure 3-2, consisting of a representative information system with multiple components (servers), are designed to help the ISCP Coordinator streamline and focus contingency plan development activities to achieve a more effective plan. An example of the BIA process and a BIA template are provided in Appendix B.\n\n### 3.2.1 Determine Business Processes and Recovery Criticality\n\nAn information system can be very complex and often supports multiple mission/business processes, resulting in different perspectives on the importance of system services or capabilities. To accomplish the BIA and better understand the impacts a system outage or disruption can have on the organization, the ISCP Coordinator should work with management and internal and external points of contact (POC) to identify and validate mission/business processes and processes that depend on or support the information system. The identified processes' impacts are then further analyzed in terms of...\n```# Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality\n\nand the established FIPS 199 impact level for the information system.",

The identified processes' impacts are then further analyzed in terms of...\n```# Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality\n\nand the established FIPS 199 impact level for the information system.\n\nFIPS 199 requires organizations to categorize their information systems as low impact, moderate impact, or high impact for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (RMF Step 1). The FIPS 199 category for the availability security objective serves as a basis of the BIA. Further identification of additional mission/business processes and impacts captures the unique purpose of the system. Organizational and system uniqueness are important considerations for contingency planning and business impact. Adding information types to address this uniqueness will enhance the prioritization of system component impacts.\n\nUnique processes and impacts can be expressed in values or units of measurement that are meaningful to the organization. Values can be identified using a scale and should be characterized as an indication of impact severity to the organization if the process could not be performed. For example, an impact category such as \"Costs\" can be created with impact values expressed in terms of staffing, overtime, or fee-related costs.\n\nThe ISCP Coordinator should next analyze the supported mission/business processes and with the process owners, leadership and business managers determine the acceptable downtime if a given process or specific system data were disrupted or otherwise unavailable. Downtime can be identified in several ways.\n\n## Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)\n\nThe MTD represents the total amount of time the system owner/authorizing official is willing to accept for a mission/business process outage or disruption and includes all impact considerations. Determining MTD is important because it could leave contingency planners with imprecise direction on (1) selection of an appropriate recovery method, and (2) the depth of detail which will be required when developing recovery procedures, including their scope and content.\n\n## Recovery Time Objective (RTO)",

Determining the information system resource RTO is important for selecting appropriate technologies that are best suited for meeting the MTD. When it is not feasible to immediately meet the RTO and the MTD is inflexible, a Plan of Action and Milestone should be initiated to document the situation and plan for its mitigation.\n\n## Recovery Point Objective (RPO)\n\nThe RPO represents the point in time, prior to a disruption or system outage, to which mission/business process data can be recovered (given the most recent backup copy of the data) after an outage. Unlike RTO, RPO is not considered as part of MTD. Rather, it is a factor of how much data loss the mission/business process can tolerate during the recovery process.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nBecause the RTO must ensure that the MTD is not exceeded, the RTO must normally be shorter than the MTD.

This can be depicted using a simple chart, such as the example in Figure 3-3.\n\nThe longer a disruption is allowed to continue, the more costly it can become to the organization and its operations. Conversely, the shorter the RTO, the more expensive the recovery solutions cost to implement. For example, if the system must be recovered immediately, zero downtime solutions and alternate processing site costs will be much higher, whereas a low-impact system with a longer RTO would be able to implement a less costly simple tape backup system. Plotting the cost balance points will show an optimal point between disruption and recovery costs. The intersecting point (Cost Balance Point in Figure 3-3: Cost Balancing) will be different for every organization and system based on the financial constraints and operating requirements.",

Working with management and internal and external POCs associated with the system, the ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the complete information system resources are identified. A simple table such as the one shown in Table 3-1 can be used to capture relevant information system resources.\n\n### 3.2.3 Identify System Resource Recovery Priorities\n\nDeveloping recovery priorities is the last step of the BIA process. Recovery priorities can be effectively established taking into consideration mission/business process criticality, outage impacts, tolerable downtime, and system resources. The result is an information system recovery priority hierarchy. The ISCP Coordinator should consider system recovery measures and technologies to meet the recovery priorities.\n```# 3.3 Identify Preventive Controls\n\nIn some cases, the outage impacts identified in the BIA may be mitigated or eliminated through preventive measures that deter, detect, and/or reduce impacts to the system.

The methods and strategies should address disruption impacts and allowable downtimes identified in the BIA and should be integrated into the system architecture during the Development/Acquisition phase of the SDLC. A wide variety of recovery approaches may be considered, with the appropriate choice being highly dependent upon the incident, type of system, BIA/FIPS 199 impact level, and the system's operational requirements. Specific recovery methods further described in Section 3.4.2 should be considered and may include commercial contracts with alternate site vendors, reciprocal agreements with internal or external organizations, and service-level agreements (SLAs) with equipment vendors. In addition, technologies such as redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID), automatic failover, UPS, server clustering, and# Mirrored Systems\n\nMirrored systems should be considered when developing a system recovery strategy.

Policies should specify the minimum frequency and scope of backups (e.g., daily or weekly, incremental or full) based on data criticality and the frequency that new information is introduced. Data backup policies should designate the location of stored data, file-naming conventions, media rotation frequency, and method for transporting data offsite. Data may be backed up on magnetic disk, tape, or optical disks, such as compact disks (CDs). The specific method chosen for conducting backups should be based on system and data availability and integrity requirements. These methods may include electronic vaulting, network storage, and tape library systems.\n\nIt is good business practice to store backed-up data offsite. Commercial data storage facilities are specially designed to archive media and protect data from threatening elements. If using offsite storage, data is backed up at the organization's facility and then labeled, packed, and transported to the storage facility. If the data is required for recovery or testing purposes, the organization contacts the storage facility requesting specific data to be transported to the organization or to an alternate facility. Commercial storage facilities often offer media transportation and response and recovery services.\n\nWhen selecting an offsite storage facility and vendor, the following criteria should be considered:\n\n- **Geographic area:** distance from the organization and the probability of the storage site being affected by the same disaster as the organization's primary site;\n- **Accessibility:** length of time necessary to retrieve the data from storage and the storage facility's operating hours;\n- **Security:** security capabilities of the shipping method, storage facility, and personnel; all must meet the data's security requirements;\n- **Environment:** structural and environmental conditions of the storage facility (i.e., temperature, humidity, fire prevention, and power management controls); and\n- **Cost:** cost of shipping, operational fees, and disaster response/recovery services.\n\n## 3.4.3 Alternate Sites",
  "When selecting an offsite storage facility and vendor, the following criteria should be considered:\n\n- **Geographic area:** distance from the organization and the probability of the storage site being affected by the same disaster as the organization's primary site;\n- **Accessibility:** length of time necessary to retrieve the data from storage and the storage facility's operating hours;\n- **Security:** security capabilities of the shipping method, storage facility, and personnel; all must meet the data's security requirements;\n- **Environment:** structural and environmental conditions of the storage facility (i.e., temperature, humidity, fire prevention, and power management controls); and\n- **Cost:** cost of shipping, operational fees, and disaster response/recovery services.\n\n## 3.4.3 Alternate Sites\n\nAs stated in Section 2.1, NIST SP 800-53 identifies the CP controls for information systems. The FIPS 199 security categorization for the availability security objective determines which controls apply to a particular system. For example, an information system categorized with a low-availability security objective does not require alternate storage or a processing site (CP-6 and CP-7, respectively), and an information system with a moderate-availability security objective requires the system backup and testing.# Contingency Planning Controls\n\nThe backup (CP-9 [1]). Further details and descriptions of the contingency planning controls are provided in Appendix E.\n\nAlthough major disruptions with long-term effects may be rare, they should be accounted for in the contingency plan. Thus, for all FIPS 199 moderate- or high-impact systems, the plan should include a strategy to recover and perform system operations at an alternate facility for an extended period. Organizations may consider FIPS 199 low-impact systems for alternate site processing, but that is an organizational decision and not required.\n\nIn general, three types of alternate sites are available:\n\n- Dedicated site owned or operated by the organization;\n- Reciprocal agreement or memorandum of agreement with an internal or external entity; and\n- Commercially leased facility.",

Other variations or combinations of these can be found, but generally all variations retain similar core features found in one of these three site types. Progressing from basic to advanced, the sites are described below.\n\n- **Cold Sites** are typically facilities with adequate space and infrastructure (electric power, telecommunications connections, and environmental controls) to support information system recovery activities.\n- **Warm Sites** are partially equipped office spaces that contain some or all of the system hardware, software, telecommunications, and power sources.\n- **Hot Sites** are facilities appropriately sized to support system requirements and configured with the necessary system hardware, supporting infrastructure, and support personnel.\n\nAs discussed above, these three alternate site types are the most common. There are also variations, and hybrid mixtures of features from any one of the three. Each organization should evaluate its core requirements in order to establish the most effective solution. Two examples of variations to the site types are:\n\n- **Mobile Sites** are self-contained, transportable shells custom-fitted with specific telecommunications and system equipment necessary to meet system requirements.\n- **Mirrored Sites** are fully redundant facilities with automated real-time information mirroring. Mirrored sites are identical to the primary site in all technical respects.",

Mirrored sites are identical to the primary site in all technical respects.\n\nThere are obvious cost and ready-time differences among the options. In these examples, the mirrored site is the most expensive choice, but it ensures virtually 100 percent availability. Cold sites are the least expensive to maintain, although they may require substantial time to acquire and install necessary equipment. Partially equipped sites, such as warm sites, fall in the middle of the spectrum. In many cases, mobile sites may be delivered to the desired location within 24 hours, but the time necessary for equipment installation and setup can increase this response time. The selection of fixed-site locations should account for the time and mode of transportation necessary to move personnel and/or equipment.# Alternate Site Considerations\n\nThere. In addition, the fixed site should be in a geographic area that is unlikely to be negatively affected by the same hazard as the organization's primary site.\n\n## Criteria for Alternate Sites\n\nTable summarizes the criteria that can be employed to determine which type of alternate site meets the organization's requirements. Sites should be analyzed further by the organization, including considerations given to business impacts and downtime defined in the BIA. As sites are evaluated, the ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the system's security, management, operational, and technical controls are compatible with the prospective site. Such controls may include firewalls, physical access controls, and personnel security requirements of the staff supporting the site.\n\n## Types of Alternate Sites",

Such controls may include firewalls, physical access controls, and personnel security requirements of the staff supporting the site.\n\n## Types of Alternate Sites\n\nAlternate sites may be owned and operated by the organization (internal recovery), or commercial sites may be available under contract. If contracting for the site with a commercial vendor, adequate testing time, work space, security requirements, hardware requirements, telecommunications requirements, support services, and recovery days (how long the organization can occupy the space during the recovery period) must be negotiated and clearly stated in the contract. Customers should be aware that multiple organizations may contract with a vendor for the same alternate site; as a result, the site may be unable to accommodate all of the customers if a disaster affects enough of those customers simultaneously. The vendor's policy on how this situation should be addressed and how priority status is determined should be negotiated.\n\n## Reciprocal Agreements\n\nTwo or more organizations with similar or identical system configurations and backup technologies may enter into a formal agreement to serve as alternate sites for each other or enter into a joint contract for an alternate site. This type of site is set up via a reciprocal agreement or memorandum of understanding (MOU). A reciprocal agreement should be entered into carefully because each site must be able to support the other, in addition to its own workload, in the event of a disaster. This type of agreement requires the recovery sequence for the systems from both organizations to be prioritized from a joint perspective, favorable to both parties.\n\n## Testing and Evaluation",

This type of agreement requires the recovery sequence for the systems from both organizations to be prioritized from a joint perspective, favorable to both parties.\n\n## Testing and Evaluation\n\nTesting should be conducted at the partnering sites to evaluate the extra processing thresholds, compatible system and backup configurations, sufficient telecommunications connections, compatible security measures, and the sensitivity of data that might be accessible by other privileged users, in addition to functionality of the recovery strategy. Consideration should also be given to system interconnections and possible interconnection security agreements (ISAs). NIST SP 800-47, Security Guide for Interconnecting Information Technology Systems, provides guidance for planning, establishing, maintaining, and terminating interconnections between information systems that are owned and operated by different organizations.\n\n## Legal Considerations\n\nAn MOU or an SLA for an alternate site should be developed specific to the organization's needs and the partner organization's capabilities. The legal department of each party must review and approve the agreement. In general, the agreement should address at a minimum, each of the following elements:# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",

  "## 3.4.4 Equipment Replacement\n\nIf the information system is damaged or destroyed or the primary site is unavailable, necessary hardware and software will need to be activated or procured quickly and delivered to the alternate location. Three basic strategies exist to prepare for equipment replacement.\n\n- **Vendor Agreements.** As the contingency plan is being developed, SLAs with hardware, software, and support vendors may be made for emergency maintenance service. The SLA should specify how quickly the vendor must respond after being notified. The agreement should also give the organization priority status for the shipment of replacement equipment over equipment being purchased for normal operations. SLAs should further discuss what priority status the organization will receive in the event of a catastrophic disaster involving multiple vendor clients. In such cases, organizations with health- and safety-dependent processes will often receive the highest priority for shipment. The details of these negotiations should be# Documented in the SLA\n\nwhich should be maintained with the contingency plan.\n\n## Equipment Inventory\n\nRequired equipment may be purchased in advance and stored at a secure offsite location, such as an alternate site where recovery operations will take place (warm or mobile site) or at another location where they will be stored and then shipped to the alternate site. This solution has certain drawbacks. An organization must commit financial resources to purchase this equipment in advance, and the equipment could become obsolete or unsuitable for use over time because system technologies and requirements change.\n\n## Existing Compatible Equipment\n\nEquipment currently housed and used by the contracted hot site or by another organization within the organization may be used. Agreements made with hot sites and reciprocal internal sites stipulate that similar and compatible equipment will be available for contingency use by the organization.\n\nWhen evaluating the choices, the ISCP Coordinator should consider that purchasing equipment when needed is cost-effective but can add significant overhead time to recovery while waiting for shipment and setup; conversely, storing unused equipment is costly, but allows recovery operations to begin more quickly. When selecting the most appropriate strategy, note that the availability of transportation may be limited or temporarily halted in the event of a catastrophic disaster. Based on impacts discovered through the BIA, consideration should be given to the possibility of a widespread disaster entailing mass equipment replacement and transportation delays that would extend the recovery period. Regardless of the strategy selected, detailed lists of equipment needs and specifications should be maintained within the contingency plan. Documentation of equipment lists is discussed further in Section 4.1.\n\n## 3.4.5 Cost Considerations",

Regardless of the strategy selected, detailed lists of equipment needs and specifications should be maintained within the contingency plan. Documentation of equipment lists is discussed further in Section 4.1.\n\n## 3.4.5 Cost Considerations\n\nThe ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the strategy chosen can be implemented effectively with available personnel and financial resources. The cost of each type of alternate site, equipment replacement, and storage option under consideration should be weighed against budget limitations. The coordinator should determine known contingency planning expenses, such as alternate site contract fees, and those that are less obvious, such as the cost of implementing an agency-wide contingency awareness program and contractor support. The budget must be sufficient to encompass software, hardware, travel and shipping, testing, plan training programs, awareness programs, labor hours, other contracted services, and any other applicable resources (e.g., desks, telephones, fax machines, pens, and paper). The organization should perform a cost-benefit analysis to identify the optimum contingency strategy. Table provides a template for evaluating cost considerations.\n\n## 3.4.6 Roles and Responsibilities\n\nHaving selected and implemented the backup and system recovery strategies, the ISCP Coordinator must designate appropriate teams to implement the strategy. Each team should be trained and ready to respond in the event of a disruptive situation requiring plan activation. Recovery personnel should be assigned to# Recovery Teams and Their Roles\n\nOne of several specific teams that will respond to the event, recover capabilities, and return the system to normal operations. To do so, recovery team members need to clearly understand the team's recovery effort goal, individual procedures the team will execute, and how interdependencies between recovery teams may affect overall strategies.\n\n## Types of Teams Required",

The size of each team, team titles, and hierarchy designs depend on the organization. In addition to a single authoritative role for overall decision-making responsibility, including plan activation, a capable strategy will require some or all of the following groups:\n\n- Management team (including the ISCP Coordinator);\n- Outage assessment team;\n- Operating system administration team;\n- Server recovery team (e.g., client server, Web server);\n- Local Area Network/Wide Area Network (LAN/WAN) recovery team;\n- Database recovery team;\n- Network operations recovery team;\n- Application recovery team(s);\n- Telecommunications team;\n- Test team;\n- Transportation and relocation team;\n- Media relations team;\n- Legal affairs team;\n- Physical/personnel security team; and\n- Procurement team (equipment and supplies).\n\n## Team Composition\n\nPersonnel should be chosen to staff these teams based on their skills and knowledge.

Team members must understand not only the contingency plan purpose, but also the procedures necessary for executing the recovery strategy.",

Team members must understand not only the contingency plan purpose, but also the procedures necessary for executing the recovery strategy.\n\nTeams should be sufficient in size to remain viable if some members are unavailable to respond or alternate team members may be designated. Similarly, team members should be familiar with the goals and procedures of other teams to facilitate cross-team coordination. The ISCP Coordinator should also consider that a disruption could render some personnel unavailable to respond. In this situation, executing the plan may be possible only by using personnel from another geographic area of the organization or by hiring contractors or vendors. Such personnel may be coordinated and trained as an alternate team.\n\n## Team Leadership\n\nEach team is led by a team leader who directs overall team operations, acts as the team's representative to management, and liaises with other team leaders. The team leader disseminates information to team members and approves any decisions that must be made within the team.

In addition, as indicated in Step 4 (Assess Security Controls) of the RMF, the effectiveness of the information system controls should be assessed by using the procedures documented in NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems. NIST SP 800-84, Guide to Test, Training and Exercise Programs for Information Technology Plans and Capabilities, provides guidelines on designing, developing, conducting, and evaluating test, training, and exercise (TT&E) events so that organizations can improve their ability to prepare for, respond to, manage, and recover from adverse events. While the majority of TT&E activities occur during the Operations/Maintenance phase, initial TT&E events should be conducted during the Implementation/Assessment phase of the SDLC to validate ISCP recovery procedures.",
  "Organizations should conduct TT&E events periodically, following organizational or system changes, or the issuance of new TT&E guidance, or as otherwise needed. Execution of TT&E events assists organizations in determining the plan's effectiveness, and that all personnel know what their roles are in the conduct of each information system plan. TT&E event schedules are often dictated in part by organizational requirements. For example, NIST SP 800-53 includes a control (CP-4) for federal organizations to conduct exercises or tests for their systems' contingency plans around an organization-defined frequency. Section 3.5.4 provides guidance on the type of TT&E identified for each FIPS 199 impact level.\n\nFor each TT&E activity conducted, results are documented in an after-action report, and Lessons Learned corrective actions are captured for updating information in the ISCP. While NIST SP 800-84 provides detailed information on how to plan and conduct TT&E activities for information systems, the following sections provide summarized details.\n\n#### 3.5.1 Testing\n\nISCP testing is a critical element of a viable contingency capability. Testing enables plan deficiencies to be identified and addressed by validating one or more of the system components and the operability of the# Contingency Plan Testing and Training\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting can take on several forms and accomplish several objectives but should be conducted in as close to an operating environment as possible. Each information system component should be tested to confirm the accuracy of individual recovery procedures. The following areas should be addressed in a contingency plan test, as applicable:\n\n- Notification procedures;\n- System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media;\n- Internal and external connectivity;\n- System performance using alternate equipment;\n- Restoration of normal operations; and\n- Other plan testing (where coordination is identified, i.e., COOP, BCP).\n\nTo derive the most value from the test, the ISCP Coordinator should develop a test plan designed to examine the selected element(s) against explicit test objectives and success criteria. The use of test objectives and success criteria enable the effectiveness of each system element and the overall plan to be assessed. The test plan should include a schedule detailing the time frames for each test and test participants. The test plan should also clearly delineate scope, scenario, and logistics. The scenario chosen may be a worst-case incident or an incident most likely to occur. It should mimic reality as closely as possible.\n\n### Testing",

For example, an organization could test call tree lists to determine if calling can be executed within prescribed time limits; another test may be removing power from a system or system component. A test is conducted in as close to an operational environment as possible; if feasible, an actual test of the components or systems used to conduct daily operations for the organization should be used. The scope of testing can range from individual system components or systems to comprehensive tests of all systems and components that support an ISCP. Tests often focus on recovery and backup operations; however, testing varies depending on the FIPS 199 impact level, the goal of the test, and its relation to a specific ISCP.\n\n## 3.5.2 Training\n\nTraining for personnel with contingency plan responsibilities should focus on familiarizing them with ISCP roles and teaching skills necessary to accomplish those roles. This approach helps ensure that staff is prepared to participate in tests and exercises as well as actual outage events. Training should be provided at least annually. Personnel newly appointed to ISCP roles should receive training shortly thereafter. Ultimately, ISCP personnel should be trained to the extent that they are able to execute their respective recovery roles and responsibilities without aid of the actual ISCP document. This is an important goal in the event that paper or electronic versions of the plan are unavailable for the first few hours, as a result of the disruption.

Training personnel on their roles and responsibilities before an exercise or test event is typically split between a presentation on their roles and responsibilities and activities that allow personnel to demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter.\n\n### 3.5.3 Exercises\nNIST SP 800-84 identifies the following types of exercises widely used in information system TT&E programs by single organizations:\n- **Tabletop Exercises.** Tabletop exercises are discussion-based exercises where personnel meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular emergency situation. A facilitator presents a scenario and asks the exercise participants questions related to the scenario, which initiates a discussion among the participants of roles, responsibilities, coordination, and decision making. A tabletop exercise is discussion-based only and does not involve deploying equipment or other resources.",

A tabletop exercise is discussion-based only and does not involve deploying equipment or other resources.\n\n- **Functional Exercises.** Functional exercises allow personnel to validate their operational readiness for emergencies by performing their duties in a simulated operational environment. Functional exercises are designed to exercise the roles and responsibilities of specific team members, procedures, and assets involved in one or more functional aspects of a plan (e.g., communications, emergency notifications, system equipment setup). Functional exercises vary in complexity and scope, from validating specific aspects of a plan to full-scale exercises that address all plan elements. Functional exercises allow staff to execute their roles and responsibilities as they would in an actual emergency situation, but in a simulated manner.\n\n## Exercises\nAn exercise is a simulation of an emergency designed to validate the viability of one or more aspects of an ISCP. In an exercise, personnel with roles and responsibilities in a particular ISCP meet to validate the content of a plan through discussion of their roles and their responses to emergency situations, execution of responses in a simulated operational environment, or other means of validating responses that do not involve using the actual operational environment. Exercises are scenario-driven, such as a power failure in one of the organization's data.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\ncenters or a fire causing certain systems to be damaged, with additional situations often being presented during the course of an exercise.\n\n## 3.5.4 TT&E Program Summary",

Guidance on establishing an effective ISCP TT&E program and the various methods and approaches for conducting TT&E activities is provided in NIST SP 800-84. The depth and rigor of ISCP TT&E activities increases with the FIPS 199 availability security objective. All tests and exercises should include some kind of determination of the effects on the organization's operations and provide for a mechanism to update and improve the plan as a result.\n\nEach of the three ISCP Templates (FIPS 199 low, moderate, and high) included as appendices to this guide contain details for conducting TT&E activities appropriate to their respective impact level.\n\n- For low-impact systems, a tabletop exercise at an organization-defined frequency is sufficient. The tabletop should simulate a disruption, include all main ISCP points of contact, and be conducted by the system owner or responsible authority.\n\n- For moderate-impact systems, a functional exercise at an organization-defined frequency should be conducted. The functional exercise should include all ISCP points of contact and be facilitated by the system owner or responsible authority. Exercise procedures should be developed to include an element of system recovery from backup media.\n\n- For high-impact systems, a full-scale functional exercise at an organization-defined frequency should be conducted. The full-scale functional exercise should include a system failover to the alternate location. This could include additional activities such as full notification and response of key personnel to the recovery location, recovery of a server or database from backup media or setup, and processing from a server at an alternate location. The test should also include a full recovery and reconstitution of the information system to a known state.",

During the Operation/Maintenance phase of the SDLC, information systems undergo frequent changes because of shifting business needs, technology upgrades, or new internal or external policies. Therefore, it is essential that the ISCP be reviewed and updated regularly as part of the organization's change management process to ensure that new information is documented and contingency measures are revised if required. As identified as part of RMF Step 6 (Continuous Monitoring), a continuous monitoring process can provide organizations with an effective tool for plan maintenance, producing ongoing updates to security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestone documents.\n\nAs a general rule, the plan should be reviewed for accuracy and completeness at# Current Page Raw OCR Text\n\nAn organization-defined frequency or whenever significant changes occur to any element of the plan. Certain elements, such as contact lists, will require more frequent reviews. The plans for moderate- or high-impact systems should be reviewed more often. At a minimum, plan reviews should focus on the following elements:",

Typically, copies of the plan are provided to recovery personnel for storage. A copy should also be stored at the alternate site and with the backup media. Storing a copy of the plan at the alternate site ensures its availability and good condition in the event local plan copies cannot be accessed because of disaster. The ISCP Coordinator should maintain a record of copies of the plan and to whom they were distributed. Other information that should be stored with the plan includes contracts with vendors (SLAs and other contracts), software licenses, system user manuals, security manuals, and operating procedures.\n\nChanges made to the plan, strategies, and policies should be coordinated through the ISCP Coordinator, who should communicate changes to the representatives of associated plans or programs, as necessary. The ISCP Coordinator should record plan modifications using a record of changes, which lists the page number, change comment, and date of change. The record of changes, depicted in Table, should be integrated into the plan as discussed in Section 4.1.\n\nThe ISCP Coordinator should coordinate frequently with associated internal and external organizations and system POCs to ensure that impacts caused by changes within any organization will be reflected in the contingency plan. Strict version control must be maintained by requesting old plans or plan pages to be returned to the ISCP Coordinator in exchange for the new plan or plan pages.

Information System Contingency Plan Development\nThis chapter discusses the key elements that compose the ISCP. As described in Chapter 3, ISCP development is a critical step in the process of implementing a comprehensive contingency planning program. The plan contains detailed roles, responsibilities, teams, and procedures associated with restoring an information system following a disruption. The ISCP should document technical capabilities designed to support contingency operations and should be tailored to the organization and its requirements. Plans need to balance detail with flexibility; usually, the more detailed the plan, the less scalable and versatile the approach. The information presented here is meant to be a guide; nevertheless, the plan format in this document may be modified as needed to better meet the user's specific system, operational, and organization requirements. Appendix A provides templates that organizations may use to develop ISCPs for their information systems at the appropriate FIPS 199 impact level. The information and templates provided are guides and may be modified, customized, and/or adapted as necessary to best meet the specific system, operational, and organizational requirements for contingency planning. Appendix D discusses planning considerations regarding personnel which should be coordinated with the ISCP development.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4-1, this guide identifies five main components of the contingency plan. The supporting information and plan appendices provide essential information to ensure a comprehensive plan. The Activation and Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution Phases address specific actions that the organization should take following a system disruption or emergency. Each plan component is discussed later in this section.",
  "As shown in Figure 4-1, this guide identifies five main components of the contingency plan. The supporting information and plan appendices provide essential information to ensure a comprehensive plan. The Activation and Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution Phases address specific actions that the organization should take following a system disruption or emergency. Each plan component is discussed later in this section.\n\nPlans should be formatted to provide quick and clear directions in the event that personnel unfamiliar with the plan or the systems are called on to perform recovery operations. Plans should be clear, concise, and easy to implement in an emergency. Where possible, checklists and step-by-step procedures should be used. A concise and well-formatted plan reduces the likelihood of creating an overly complex or confusing plan.\n\n### 4.1 Supporting Information\nThe supporting information component includes an introduction and concept of operations section providing essential background or contextual information that makes the contingency plan easier to understand, implement, and maintain. These details aid in understanding the applicability of the guidance, in making decisions on how to use the plan, and in providing.\n```# Information on Where Associated Plans and Information Outside the Scope of the Plan May Be Found\n\nThe introduction section orients the reader to the type and location of information contained in the plan. Generally, the section includes the background, scope, and assumptions. These subsections are described below.\n\n## Background\nThis subsection establishes the reason for developing the ISCP and defines the plan objectives.\n\n## Scope\nThe scope identifies the FIPS 199 impact level and associated RTOs as well as the alternate site and data storage capabilities (as applicable).\n\n## Assumptions\nThis section includes the list of assumptions that were used in developing the ISCP as well as a list of situations that are not applicable. See Appendix A Sample Information System Contingency Plan Templates, for a sample of assumptions and situations.\n\n# Concept of Operations\n\nThe concept of operations section provides additional details about the information system, the three phases of the contingency plan (Activation and Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution), and a description of the information system contingency plan roles and responsibilities. This section may include the following elements:",

This section may include the following elements:\n\n## System Description\nIt is necessary to include a general description of the information system addressed by the contingency plan. The description should include the information system architecture, location(s), and any other important technical considerations. An input/output (I/O) diagram and system architecture diagram, including security devices (e.g., firewalls, internal and external connections) are useful. The content for the system description can usually be taken from the System Security Plan.\n\n## Overview of Three Phases\nThe ISCP recovery is implemented in three phases: (1) Activation and Notification, (2) Recovery, and (3) Reconstitution.\n\n## Roles and Responsibilities\nThe roles and responsibilities section presents the overall structure of contingency teams, including the hierarchy and coordination mechanisms and requirements among the teams. The section also provides an overview of team member roles and responsibilities in a contingency situation. Teams and team members should be designated for specific response and recovery roles during contingency plan activation.\n\n# 4.2 Activation and Notification Phase\n\nThe Activation and Notification Phase defines initial actions taken once a system disruption or outage has been detected or appears to be imminent. This phase includes activities to notify recovery personnel, conduct an outage assessment, and activate the plan. At the completion of the Activation and Notification Phase, ISCP staff will be prepared to perform recovery measures to restore system functions.",

This phase includes activities to notify recovery personnel, conduct an outage assessment, and activate the plan. At the completion of the Activation and Notification Phase, ISCP staff will be prepared to perform recovery measures to restore system functions.\n\n## 4.2.1 Activation Criteria and Procedure\nThe ISCP should be activated if one or more of the activation criteria for that system are met. If an activation criterion is met, the designated authority should activate the plan. Activation criteria for system outages or disruptions are unique for each organization and should be stated in the contingency planning policy. Criteria may be based on:# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n- Extent of any damage to the system (e.g., physical, operational, or cost);\n- Criticality of the system to the organization's mission (e.g., critical infrastructure protection asset); and\n- Expected duration of the outage lasting longer than the RTO.\n\nThe appropriate recovery teams may be notified once the system outage or disruption has been identified and the ISCP Coordinator has determined that activation criteria have been met. Notification procedures should follow the procedures outlined in Section 4.2.2 below.\n\n## 4.2.2 Notification Procedures",

Notification procedures should follow the procedures outlined in Section 4.2.2 below.\n\n## 4.2.2 Notification Procedures\n\nAn outage or disruption may occur with or without prior notice. For example, advance notice is often given that a hurricane is predicted to affect an area or that a computer virus is expected on a certain date. However, there may be no notice of equipment failure or a criminal act. Notification procedures should be documented in the plan for both types of situation. The procedures should describe the methods used to notify recovery personnel during business and non-business hours. Prompt notification is important for reducing the effects of a disruption on the system; in some cases, it may provide enough time to allow system personnel to shut down the system gracefully to avoid a hard crash.\n\nFollowing the outage or disruption, notification should be sent to the Outage Assessment Team so that it may determine the status of the situation and appropriate next steps. Outage assessment procedures are described in Section 4.2.3. When outage assessment is complete, the appropriate recovery and system support personnel should be notified.\n\nNotifications can be accomplished through a variety of methods, either automated or manual and include telephone, pager, electronic mail (email), cell phone, and messaging. Automated notification systems follow established protocols and criteria and can include rapid authentication and acceptance and secure messaging. Automated notification systems require up-front investment and learning curve, but may be an effective way for some organizations to ensure prompt and accurate delivery.",

Automated notification systems follow established protocols and criteria and can include rapid authentication and acceptance and secure messaging. Automated notification systems require up-front investment and learning curve, but may be an effective way for some organizations to ensure prompt and accurate delivery.\n\nNotifications sent via email should be done with caution because there is no way to ensure receipt and acknowledgement. Although email has potential as an effective method of disseminating notifications to work or personal accounts, there is no way to guarantee that the message will be read. If using an email notification method, recovery personnel should be informed of the necessity to frequently and regularly check their accounts. Notifications sent during business hours should be sent to the work address, whereas personal email messaging may be useful in the event that the local area network (LAN) is down.\n\nThe notification strategy should define procedures to be followed in the event that specific personnel cannot be contacted. Notification procedures should be documented clearly in the contingency plan. Copies of the procedures can be made and located securely at alternate locations. A common manual notification method is a call tree. This technique involves assigning notification duties to specific individuals, who in turn are responsible for notifying other recovery personnel. The call tree should account for primary and alternate contact methods and should discuss procedures.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nTo be followed if an individual cannot be contacted.

Depending on the type of outage or disruption, the POC may have recovery responsibilities. For each system interconnection with an external organization, a POC should be identified. These POCs should be listed in an appendix to the plan.\n\nThe type of information to be relayed to those being notified should be documented in the plan. The amount and detail of information relayed may depend on the specific team being notified. As necessary, notification information may include the following:\n\n- Nature of the outage or disruption that has occurred or is impending;\n- Any known outage estimates;\n- Response and recovery details;\n- Where and when to convene for briefing or further response instructions;\n- Instructions to prepare for relocation for estimated time period (if applicable); and\n- Instructions to complete notifications using the call tree (if applicable).\n\n## 4.2.3 Outage Assessment",

The outage assessment should be completed as quickly as the given conditions permit, with personnel safety remaining the highest priority. When possible, the Outage Assessment Team is the first team notified of the disruption. Outage assessment procedures may be unique for the particular system, but the following minimum areas should be addressed:\n\n- Cause of the outage or disruption;\n- Potential for additional disruptions or damage;\n- Status of physical infrastructure (e.g., structural integrity of computer room, condition of electric power, telecommunications, and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning [HVAC]);\n- Inventory and functional status of system equipment (e.g., fully functional, partially functional, nonfunctional);\n- Type of damage to system equipment or data (e.g., water, fire and heat, physical impact, electrical surge);\n- Items to be replaced (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, supporting materials); and\n- Estimated time to restore normal services.\n\nPersonnel with outage assessment responsibilities should understand and be able.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## to perform these\nprocedures in the event the plan is inaccessible during the situation. Once impact to the system has been determined, the appropriate teams should be notified of updated information and the planned response to the situation.

Based upon the results of the outage assessment, ISCP notifications may be revisited and expanded using the procedures described in Section 4.2.2.\n\n## 4.3 Recovery Phase\nFormal recovery operations begin after the ISCP has been activated, outage assessments have been completed (if possible), personnel have been notified, and appropriate teams have been mobilized. Recovery Phase activities focus on implementing recovery strategies to restore system capabilities, repair damage, and resume operational capabilities at the original or new alternate location. At the completion of the Recovery Phase, the information system will be functional and capable of performing the functions identified in the plan. Depending on the recovery strategies defined in the plan, these functions could include temporary manual processing, recovery and operation at an alternate system, or relocation and recovery at an alternate site. It is feasible that only system resources identified as high priority in the BIA will be recovered at this stage.\n\n### 4.3.1 Sequence of Recovery Activities\nWhen recovering a complex system, such as a wide area network (WAN) or virtual local area network (VLAN) involving multiple independent components, recovery procedures should reflect system priorities identified in the BIA. The sequence of activities should reflect the system's MTD to avoid significant impacts to related systems. Procedures should be written in a stepwise, sequential format so system components may be restored in a logical manner. For example, if a LAN is being recovered after a disruption, then the most critical servers should be recovered before other, less critical devices, such as printers. Similarly, to recover an application server, procedures first should address operating system restoration and verification before the application and its data are recovered. The procedures should also include escalation steps and instructions to coordinate with other teams where relevant when certain situations occur, such as:\n- An action is not completed within the expected time frame;\n- A key step has been completed;\n- Item(s) must be procured; and\n- Other system-specific concerns exist.",
  "If conditions require the system to be recovered at an alternate site, certain materials will need to be transferred or procured. These items may include shipment of data backup media from offsite storage, hardware, copies of the recovery plan, and software programs. Procedures should designate the appropriate team or team members to coordinate shipment of equipment, data, and vital records. References to applicable appendices, such as equipment lists or vendor contact information, should be made in the plan where necessary. Procedures should clearly describe requirements to package, transport, and purchase materials required to recover the system.\n\n### 4.3.2 Recovery Procedures# Recovery Phase Operations\n\nTo facilitate Recovery Phase operations, the ISCP should provide detailed procedures to restore the information system or components to a known state. Given the extensive variety of system types, configurations, and applications, this planning guide does not provide specific recovery procedures. Recovery considerations are detailed for each of the platform types in Chapter 5.\n\nProcedures should be assigned to the appropriate recovery team and typically address the following actions:\n\n- Obtaining authorization to access damaged facilities and/or geographic area;\n- Notifying internal and external business partners associated with the system;\n- Obtaining necessary office supplies and work space;\n- Obtaining and installing necessary hardware components;\n- Obtaining and loading backup media;\n- Restoring critical operating system and application software;\n- Restoring system data to a known state;\n- Testing system functionality including security controls;\n- Connecting system to network or other external systems; and\n- Operating alternate equipment successfully.\n\nRecovery procedures should be written in a straightforward, step-by-step style. To prevent difficulty or confusion in an emergency, no procedural steps should be assumed or omitted. A checklist format is useful for documenting the sequential recovery procedures and for troubleshooting problems if the system cannot be recovered properly. Figure 4-3 provides a partial example of a procedural checklist for a LAN Recovery Team.\n\n## 4.3.3 Recovery Escalation and Notification\n\nAs identified as part of the BIA, system components, infrastructure, and associated facilities are critical components supporting daily mission/business processes. The systems, applications, and infrastructure that connect users to these are subject to events causing service interruptions and outages. Including an escalation and notification component within the Recovery Phase helps to ensure that overall, a repeatable, structured, consistent, and measurable recovery process is followed.",

The systems, applications, and infrastructure that connect users to these are subject to events causing service interruptions and outages. Including an escalation and notification component within the Recovery Phase helps to ensure that overall, a repeatable, structured, consistent, and measurable recovery process is followed.\n\nEffective escalation and notification procedures should define and describe the events, thresholds, or other types of triggers that are necessary for additional action. Actions would include additional notifications for more recovery staff, messages and status updates to leadership, and notices for additional resources. Procedures should be included to establish a clear set of events, actions and results, and should be documented for teams or individuals as appropriate.\n\n## 4.4 Reconstitution Phase\n\nThe Reconstitution Phase is the third and final phase of ISCP implementation and defines the actions taken to test and validate system capability and functionality. During Reconstitution, recovery activities are completed and normal system operations are resumed. If the original facility is unrecoverable, the activities in this phase can also be applied to preparing a new permanent location to support system processing requirements. This phase consists of two major activities: validating successful recovery and deactivation of the plan. Validation of recovery typically includes these steps:\n\n- Concurrent Processing. Concurrent processing is the process of running a system at two separate locations concurrently until there is a level of assurance that the# Recovered System Operations\n\nThe recovered system is operating correctly and securely.\n\n## Validation Data Testing\n\nData testing is the process of testing and validating recovered data to ensure that data files or databases have been recovered completely and are current to the last available backup.\n\n## Validation Functionality Testing\n\nFunctionality testing is a process for verifying that all system functionality has been tested, and the system is ready to return to normal operations.",

This declaration may be made in a recovery/reconstitution log or other documentation of reconstitution activities. The ISCP Coordinator, in coordination with the Information System Owner, ISSO, SAISO and with the concurrence of the Authorizing Official, must determine if the system has undergone significant change and will require reassessment and reauthorization. The utilization of a continuous monitoring strategy/program can guide the scope of the reauthorization to focus on those environment/facility controls and any other controls which would be impacted by the reconstitution efforts. Assessment and authorization guidance is available in NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 1 Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.\n\n## Deactivation of the Plan\n\nDeactivation of the plan is the process of returning the system to normal operations and finalizing reconstitution activities to prepare the system against another outage or disruption. These activities include:\n\n### Notifications\n\nUpon return to normal operations, users should be notified by the ISCP Coordinator (or designee) using predefined notification procedures.\n\n### Cleanup\n\nCleanup is the process of cleaning up work space or dismantling any temporary recovery locations, restocking supplies, returning manuals or other documentation to their original locations, and readying the system for another contingency event.\n\n### Offsite Data Storage\n\nIf offsite data storage is used, procedures should be documented for returning retrieved backup or installation media to its offsite data storage location.\n\n### Data Backup\n\nAs soon as reasonable following reconstitution, the system should be fully backed up and a new copy of the current operational system stored for future recovery efforts. This full backup should be stored with other system backups and comply with applicable security controls.\n\n### Event Documentation",

An after-action report with lessons learned should be documented and included for updating the ISCP.\n\nOnce all activities and steps have been completed and documentation has been updated, the ISCP can be formally deactivated. An announcement with the declaration should be sent to all business and technical stakeholders.```markdown\n# Contacts\n\n## 4.5 Plan Appendices\n\nContingency plan appendices provide key details not contained in the main body of the plan.

Technical Contingency Planning Considerations\n\nThis chapter complements the process and framework guidelines presented in earlier sections by discussing technical contingency planning considerations for specific types of information systems. The information presented in this section will assist the reader in selecting, developing, and implementing specific technical contingency strategies based on the type of information system. Because each system is unique, considerations are provided at a level that may be used by the widest audience. The list of platforms is not comprehensive, but is representative of commonly found systems in production or development. Not all of the information presented may apply to a specific information system; the ISCP Coordinator should draw on the considerations as appropriate and customize them to meet a system's particular contingency requirements. The following representative platform types are addressed in this section:\n\n- Client/server systems;\n- Telecommunications systems; and\n- Mainframe systems.\n\nFor each system type, contingency measures are considered from two perspectives. First, the document discusses technical requirements or factors that the ISCP Coordinator should consider when planning a system recovery strategy during the Development/Acquisition Phase of the SDLC.

When developing solutions for technical contingency plans, there are several areas that should be considered regardless of the platform or type of system. These considerations provide a common foundation for any type of contingency planning effort. Several of these contingency measures are common to all information systems. Common\n``````markdown\n# Considerations Include the Following:\n\n- Use of information gathered from the BIA process;\n- Development of data security, integrity, and backup policies and procedures;\n- Protection of equipment and system resources;\n- Adherence and compliance with security controls in NIST SP 800-53;\n- Development of primary and alternate sites with appropriately sized and configured power management systems and environmental controls; and\n- Use of high availability (HA) processes to provide for online real-time resilient access to alternate system resources.

Each of these strategy decisions have cost versus availability or recovery implications. Availability and recovery implications are discussed throughout the rest of this chapter.\n\n## 5.1.2 Maintenance of Data Security, Integrity, and Backup\n\nMaintaining the integrity and security of system data and software is a key component in contingency planning. Data integrity involves keeping data safe and accurate on the system's primary storage devices. There are several methods available to maintain the integrity of stored data. These methods use redundancy and fault tolerance processes to store data on more than one drive and eliminate loss of data from single drive failures. Data security involves protecting data both onsite and offsite from unauthorized access or use. Encryption is a common method for securing stored system data. Encryption is most effective when applied to both the primary data storage device and on backup media going to an offsite location. If using encryption for offsite data storage, it is important that media readers (e.g., tape drives, CD or DVD readers) are available at the alternate site location to correctly read the encrypted data during recovery efforts. A solid key management process must be established so encrypted data is available as needed. Keying material, which is the data used to establish and maintain the keys, needs to be managed, ideally at a central location in the organization. These keys should be stored separate from, but accessible to, the primary encrypted backup data.\n\nKeeping backups of data in a secure offsite location allows for a ready access to backups during a contingency event. An effective data backup process is crucial to an ISCP Coordinator's overall recovery strategy. Data backups are done primarily for recovery purposes. Backups can be done through many different methods and techniques. MTD determinations and security requirements from the BIA help dictate the best method for backing up a particular system for recovery.\n```# Data Backup Methods",

Backups can be done through many different methods and techniques. MTD determinations and security requirements from the BIA help dictate the best method for backing up a particular system for recovery.\n```# Data Backup Methods\n\nData backups should be conducted on all systems on a regular basis. Systems can be backed up for individual computers or on a centralized storage device, such as network attached storage (NAS) or storage area network (SAN). There are three common methods for performing system backups:\n\n## Full\n\nA full backup captures all files on the disk or within the folder selected for backup. Because all backed-up files are recorded to a single media or media set, locating a particular file or group of files is simple. However, the time required to perform a full backup can be lengthy. In addition, maintaining multiple iterations of full backups of files that do not change frequently (such as system files) could lead to excessive, unnecessary media storage requirements.\n\n## Incremental\n\nAn incremental backup captures files that were created or changed since the last backup, regardless of backup type. Incremental backups afford more efficient use of storage media, and backup times are reduced. However, to recover a system from an incremental backup, media from different backup operations may be required. For example, consider a case in which a directory needs to be recovered. If the last full backup was performed three days prior and one file had changed each day, then the media for the full backup and for each day's incremental backups would be needed to restore the entire directory.\n\n## Differential\n\nA differential backup stores files that were created or modified since the last full backup. Therefore, if a file is changed after the previous full backup, a differential backup will save the file each time until the next full backup is completed. A differential backup takes less time to complete than a full backup. Restoring from a differential backup may require fewer media than an incremental backup because only the full backup media and the last differential media would be needed. As a disadvantage, differential backups take longer to complete than incremental backups because the amount of data since the last full backup increases each day until the next full backup is executed.",
  "## Differential\n\nA differential backup stores files that were created or modified since the last full backup.

As a disadvantage, differential backups take longer to complete than incremental backups because the amount of data since the last full backup increases each day until the next full backup is executed.\n\nA combination of backup operations can be used depending on system configuration and recovery requirements. For example, a full backup can be conducted on the weekend with differential backups conducted each evening. In developing a system backup policy, the following questions should be considered:\n\n- Where and how will media be stored?\n- What data should be backed up and how often should it be backed up?\n- How quickly are the backups to be retrieved in the event of an emergency?\n- Who is authorized to retrieve the media?\n- Where will the media be delivered and what is the rotation schedule of backup media?\n- Who will restore the data from the media?\n- What is the media-labeling scheme?\n- How long will the backup media be retained?\n- When the media are stored onsite, what environmental controls are provided to preserve the media?\n- What is the appropriate backup medium for the types of backups to be conducted?# Backup Solutions and Resource Protection\n\n## Choosing the Appropriate Backup Solution\n\nCertain factors should be considered when choosing the appropriate backup solution:\n\n- **Equipment Interoperability**: To facilitate recovery, the backup device must be compatible with the platform operating system and applications and should be easy to install onto different models or types of systems.\n\n- **Storage Volume**: To ensure adequate storage, the amount of data to be backed up should determine the appropriate backup solution.\n\n- **Media Life**: Each type of medium has a different use and storage life beyond which the media cannot be relied on for effective data recovery.\n\n- **Backup Software**: When choosing the appropriate backup solution, the software or method used to back up data should be considered. In some cases, the backup solution can be as simple as a file copy using the operating system file manager; in cases involving larger data transfers, a third-party application may be needed to automate and schedule the file backup.",

In some cases, the backup solution can be as simple as a file copy using the operating system file manager; in cases involving larger data transfers, a third-party application may be needed to automate and schedule the file backup.\n\n## Protection of Resources\n\nPart of a successful contingency planning policy is making a system resilient to environmental and component-level failures that would otherwise cause system disruptions. There are several methods for making valuable hardware and software resilient. Determination of the appropriate methods should be based on risk-informed decisions. Depending on results of the risk management process, these methods may or may not be applicable for a particular system.\n\nThe system and its data can become corrupt as a result of a power failure. Critical hardware, such as servers, can be configured with dual power supplies to prevent corruption. The two power supplies should be used simultaneously so that if the main power supply becomes overheated or unusable, the second unit will become the main power source, resulting in no system disruption.\n\nThe second power supply will protect against hardware failure, but not power failure. However, a UPS can protect the system if power is lost. A UPS usually provides 30 to 60 minutes of temporary backup power to permit a graceful shutdown. A UPS can also protect against power fluctuations by filtering incoming power and providing a steady power source. If high availability is required, a gas- or diesel-powered generator may be needed. The generator can be wired directly into the site's power system and configured to start automatically when a power interruption is detected. A combination UPS/generator system can provide clean, secure power for a system as long as fuel is available for the generator. Fuel availability should be considered for those who opt for a UPS/generator to support their system environment.",

Fuel availability should be considered for those who opt for a UPS/generator to support their system environment.\n\nIn addition to backing up data, organizations should also back up system software and drivers. Organizations should store software and software licenses in an alternate location. This includes original installation media, license terms and conditions, and license keys, if required. Image loads for client systems (such as desktops and portable systems) should also be backed up and stored at an alternate location, along with complete documentation of the software included in the system.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Image Load, Any\nConfiguration information for the type of computer for which the image is intended, and installation instructions.\n\nOrganizations may use third-party vendors to recover data from failed storage devices. Organizations should consider the security risk of having their data handled by an outside company and ensure that proper security vetting of the service provider is conducted before turning over equipment. The service provider and employees should sign non-disclosure agreements, be properly bonded, and adhere to organization-specific security policies.\n\n### 5.1.4 Adherence to Security Controls\nThe security controls established in NIST SP 800-53 provide a solid foundation for establishing information system security, integrity, and contingency policies. Adherence to these controls for contingency planning purposes helps protect an information system against threats that can disrupt operations.",

When selecting the offsite location, hours of the location, ease of accessibility to backup media, physical storage limitations, and the contract terms should be taken into account. The ISCP Coordinator should reference the organization's resilience policy and the BIA to assist in determining how often backup media should be tested. Each backup tape, cartridge, or disk should be uniquely labeled to ensure that the required data can be identified quickly in an emergency. This requires that the organization develop an effective media marking and tracking strategy.\n\nAlternate processing facilities provide a location for an organization to resume system operations in the event of a catastrophic event that disables or destroys the system's primary facility. There are three primary types of alternate processing facilities, corresponding to the level of readiness to function as a system's operations facility.",

There are three primary types of alternate processing facilities, corresponding to the level of readiness to function as a system's operations facility.\n\n- **Cold Sites.** Cold sites are locations that have the basic infrastructure and environmental controls available (such as electrical and HVAC), but no equipment or telecommunications established or in place. There is sufficient room to house needed equipment to sustain a system's critical functions. Examples of cold sites include unused areas of a data center and unused office space (if specialized data center environments are not required). Cold sites are normally the least expensive alternate processing site solution, as the primary costs are only the lease or maintenance of the required square footage for recovery purposes. However, the recovery time is the longest, as all system equipment (including telecommunications) will need to be acquired or purchased, installed, tested, and have backup software and data loaded and tested before the system can be operational. Depending on the size and complexity of a system, recovery could take several days to weeks to complete.\n\n- **Warm Sites.** Warm sites are locations that have the basic infrastructure of...# Cold Sites\n\nCold sites, but also have sufficient computer and telecommunications equipment installed and available to operate the system at the site. However, the equipment is not loaded with the software or data required to operate the system. Warm sites should have backup media readers that are compatible with the system's backup strategy. Warm sites may not have equipment to run all systems or all components of a system, but rather only enough to operate critical mission/business processes.",

Warm sites may not have equipment to run all systems or all components of a system, but rather only enough to operate critical mission/business processes.\n\nAn example of a warm site is a test or development site that is geographically separate from the production system. Equipment may be in place to operate the system, but would require reverting to the current production level of the software, loading the data from backup media, and establishing communications to users. Another example is available equipment at an alternate facility that is running noncritical systems and that could be transitioned to run a critical system during a contingency event. A warm site is more expensive than a cold site, as equipment is purchased and maintained at the warm site, with telecommunications in place. Some costs may be offset by using equipment for noncritical functions or for testing. Recovery to a warm site can take several hours to several days, depending on system complexity and the amount of data to be restored.\n\n## Hot Sites\n\nHot sites are locations with fully operational equipment and capacity to quickly take over system operations after loss of the primary system facility. A hot site has sufficient equipment and the most current version of production software installed, and adequate storage for the production system data. Hot sites should have the most recent version of backed-up data loaded, requiring only updating with data since the last backup. In many cases, hot site data and databases are updated concurrently with or soon after the primary data and databases are updated.\n\nHot sites also need a way to quickly move system users' connectivity from the primary site. One example of a hot site is two identical systems at alternate locations that are in production, serving different geographical locations or load balancing production workload. Each location is built to handle the full workload, and data is continuously synchronized between the systems. This is the most expensive option, requiring full operation of a system at an alternate location and all telecommunications capacity, with the ability to maintain or quickly update the operational data and databases. Hot sites also require having operational support nearly equal to the production.",

This is the most expensive option, requiring full operation of a system at an alternate location and all telecommunications capacity, with the ability to maintain or quickly update the operational data and databases. Hot sites also require having operational support nearly equal to the production.\n\nThe ISCP Coordinator should look at information provided in the BIA to determine what critical mission/business processes a system supports, the MTD, and the impact loss of the system would have on the business to establish what type of recovery site is needed. An information system recovery strategy may incorporate one or more of these types of alternate processing facilities. For example, some# Functionality of a System\n\nThe functionality of a system may be highly critical and require a hot site to minimize the downtime and impact on mission/business processes. However, other functionality of the same system, such as a reporting or batch printing process, may be able to be down for several days with little impact and would just need extra space in the alternate facility to place additional equipment after it is purchased.\n\n## 5.1.6 Use of High Availability (HA) Processes\n\nHA is a process where redundancy and failover processes are built into a system to maximize its uptime and availability. The concept of HA is to achieve an uptime of 99.999 percent or higher, which equates to just a few minutes per year of downtime. Several vendors offer HA products and services designed to minimize downtime by building redundancy and resiliency into the architecture.\n\nHA can be an expensive option for systems, with duplicate hardware and special failover software to eliminate any single point of failure. Normally, there are higher cost maintenance and support requirements associated with HA systems. Therefore, HA is not a viable option for many systems and should be considered only for those systems that cannot tolerate downtime. Examples of this may be air traffic systems and financial systems. Also, HA systems cannot be a replacement for a solid backup strategy, as a corruption of data on a system may propagate through an HA system, making the system unusable. Without a backup of the system separate from the system itself, recovery may not be possible.",

Also, HA systems cannot be a replacement for a solid backup strategy, as a corruption of data on a system may propagate through an HA system, making the system unusable. Without a backup of the system separate from the system itself, recovery may not be possible.\n\nHA can be implemented at a single site, with all system redundancy resident at that site. This will keep the system running at an HA level as long as there is no interruption of the facility housing the system. However, when implementing HA products or services in a system, the ISCP Coordinator should have HA processes extended to an alternate location. Mechanisms such as block mirroring to an alternate site should be considered to provide redundancy and backup of system data outside of the system facility. Whenever a write is made to a block on a primary storage device, the same write is made to an alternate storage device, either within the same storage system, or between separate storage systems, at different locations.\n\n## 5.2 Client/Server Systems\n\nClient/server systems can have processing and data at both the server and client workstation levels. Client workstations are normally desktop computers, although portable devices may be connected to servers as clients. Portable devices include laptops, notebook computers, and handheld devices (e.g., smart phones and specialized equipment such as inventory collection bar code readers).\n\nWireless and smart phone technology advances have allowed users access to key server functionality and services such as email from their mobile phones. This is normally done by using proprietary third-party software that establishes the communications and data transfer to and from the phone via the network provided by mobile cell carriers.\n\nServers support file sharing and storage, data processing, central application hosting (such as email or a central database), printing, access control, user authentication, remote access.```markdown\n# Connectivity and Other Shared System Services\n\nLocal users log into the server through networked client machines to access resources that the server provides.\n\n## 5.2.1 Client/Server Systems Contingency Considerations",

To address these requirements, regular and frequent backups of data should be stored offsite. Specifically, the system manager should consider each of the following practices for client/server systems:\n\n- **Store backups offsite or at an alternate site.** As mentioned in Section 3.4.2, backup media should be stored offsite or at an alternate site in a secure, environmentally controlled facility.\n- **Standardize hardware, software, and peripherals.** System recovery is faster if hardware, software, and peripherals are standardized throughout the organization. Additionally, critical hardware components that need to be recovered immediately in the event of a disaster should be compatible with off-the-shelf computer components. This compatibility will avoid delays in ordering custom-built equipment from a vendor.\n- **Document system configurations and vendor information.** Well-documented system configurations ease recovery. Similarly, vendor names and emergency contact information for vendors that supply essential hardware, software, and other components should be listed in the contingency plan so that replacement components may be purchased quickly.\n\n## Client/Server and Portable System Contingency Strategies:\n\n- **Store backups offsite/alternate site.**\n- **Standardize hardware, software, and peripherals.**\n- **Document system configurations and vendor information.**\n- **Coordinate with security policies and controls.**\n- **Use results of BIA.**\n- **Minimize data on client systems.**\n- **Automate backup of data.**\n- **Develop and provide guidance on backing up data.**\n- **Store backup information at an alternate site.**\n- **Coordinate contingency solutions with cyber incident response procedures.**",

In choosing the appropriate technical contingency solution, similar security controls and security-related activities (e.g., risk assessment, vulnerability scanning) applied in the production system should be implemented in the contingency solution to ensure that executing the system.\n```# Contingency\n\nSolution does not compromise or disclose sensitive data during a system disruption or emergency.",

Impacts and priorities of associated information systems discovered through the BIA should be reviewed to determine related requirements. Additional considerations for client computers include:\n- Minimize the amount of data stored on a client computer. Critical user data should be stored on central servers that are backed up as part of an organization's enterprise backup strategy, rather than on the client computer hard drive.\n- Automate backup of data. Client/server systems should have software installed that automatically schedules data backups to a central data backup location. Data for backup should be stored at a common directory name (such as \\My Documents) to ease in automated backup and to make sure that only pertinent data is backed up. If the client system backup process is not automated from the network, users should be encouraged to back up data on a regular basis. Automated backup schedulers should be set up for stand-alone desktops and portable devices whenever possible.\n- Provide guidance on saving data on client computers. Instructing users to save data to a particular folder on the computer eases the IT department's client support requirements. If a machine must be rebuilt, the technician will know which folders to copy and preserve during recovery.\n- Store backup information at an alternate site. If users back up data on a stand-alone system rather than saving data to the network, a means should be provided for storing the media at an alternate site. Software licenses and original system software, vendor SLAs and contracts, and other important documents relevant to the stand-alone should be stored with the backup media. The storage facility should be located far enough away from the original site to reduce the likelihood that both sites would be affected by the same contingency event.\n\n## Contingency considerations for servers in a client/server system\n\nContingency considerations for servers in a client/server system rely extensively on LAN and WAN connectivity to communicate with their clients. Because of this, server components must consider system contingency measures similar to those for LANs and WANs.",

System recovery may be expedited if hardware, software, and peripherals are standardized throughout the client/server system. Recovery costs may be reduced because standard configurations may be designated and resources may be shared. Standardized components also reduce system maintenance across the organization.\n- Document systems configurations and vendors. Document the server architecture and the configurations of its various components. In addition, the contingency plan should identify vendors and model specifications to facilitate rapid equipment replacement after a disruption.\n- Coordinate with security policies and security controls. Server contingency solution(s) should# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\nbe coordinated with network security policies where similar security controls and security-related activities (e.g., risk assessment, vulnerability scanning) in the production environment should be implemented in the contingency solution(s) to ensure that, during a system disruption, executing the technical contingency solution(s) does not compromise or disclose sensitive data. Security of data within a client/server system is key as most systems are multi-tenancy, having multiple users and applications residing on the same system, with different security requirements and controls.\n\n- **Coordinate contingency solutions with cyber incident response procedures.** Because many application servers use Web services to provide an image of the organization to the public, the organization's public image could be damaged if the application server were defaced or taken down by a cyber attack. To reduce the consequences of such an attack, contingency solutions should be coordinated closely with cyber incident response procedures designed to limit the impacts of a cyber attack.\n\n- **Use results from the BIA.** Impacts and priorities discovered through the BIA of associated LANs and/or WANs should be reviewed to determine recovery requirements and priorities.\n\n## 5.2.2 Client/Server Systems Contingency Solutions\n\nWide ranges of technical contingency solutions are available for client/server systems; several efficient practices are discussed in this section.",

With increased use of digital signatures for non-repudiation and the use of encryption for confidentiality and/or integrity, organizations should consider including encryption in their backup strategy. Encryption should also be considered for backup media that goes offsite for storage, to secure data should it be lost or stolen en route or at the alternate site.\n\nIf encrypted data is sent offsite for storage, there should be a cryptographic key management system in place to make sure the data is readable if it needs to be recovered onto a new or replaced system. The cryptographic key and the encryption software both need to be on the new system, along with the keying material. Keying material is the data, such as the keys and initialization points for encryption, used to establish and maintain the encryption parameters. The keying material can be stored at a central location (such as an enterprise key management and encryption system) or on removable media separate from the backup media itself.\n\nClient/server system data backups can be accomplished in various ways, including those listed below:\n\n- **Digital video disc (DVD).** DVD-read only memory (DVD-ROM) drives come standard in most desktop computers; however, not all computers are equipped with writable DVD-ROM drives. DVDs are low-cost storage media and have a higher storage capacity of around 4.7 gigabytes (GB).

To read from a DVD-ROM, the operating system's file manager is sufficient; to write to a DVD-ROM, a rewritable DVD (DVD-RW) drive and the appropriate software are required.# Backup Solutions\n\n## Network Storage\nData stored on networked client/server systems can be backed up to a networked disk. The amount of data that can be backed up from a client/server system is limited by the network disk storage capacity or disk allocation to the particular user. If users are instructed to save files to a networked disk, the networked disk itself should be backed up through the network or server backup program. Common types of network storage architecture include network attached storage (NAS) and storage area network (SAN). These storage systems incorporate resiliency and redundancy within their design and can be configured to maintain redundancy across several locations.\n\n## External Hard Drives\nData replication or synchronization to an external hard drive is a common backup method for portable computers and stand-alone devices. Handheld devices or laptops may be connected to an external hard drive and replicate the desired data from the portable device to the external hard drive. Many external hard drives have backup software included for use in backing up primary drives.\n\n## Internet Backup\nInternet Backup, or Online Backup, is a commercial service that allows desktop and portable device users to back up data to a remote location over the Internet for a fee. A utility is installed onto the desktop or portable device that allows the user to schedule backups, select files and folders to be backed up, and establish an archiving scheme to prevent files from being overwritten. Data can be encrypted for transmission; however, this will impede the data transfer. The advantage of Internet Backup is that the user is not required to purchase data backup hardware or media and that the data is readily available to be downloaded for recovery in a contingency situation.",

The advantage of Internet Backup is that the user is not required to purchase data backup hardware or media and that the data is readily available to be downloaded for recovery in a contingency situation.\n\n## Server Backup Recommendations\nServers normally have much larger amounts of data that need to be maintained and secured. It is recommended in environments with multiple servers, that storage not be dedicated to each server but rather centralized for use by multiple servers. SAN and NAS are common multi-server storage systems. Centralizing the data of multiple servers allows for a common backup of data for offsite storage. Given the large amount of data that must be backed up, it is recommended that a separate and dedicated network be used just for the data transfers required for backing up data. This will enable the primary network to be dedicated to production traffic, and not impact the backup process.\n\n## Contingency Solutions\nContingency solutions may be built into the client/server system during design and implementation. A client/server system, for example, may be constructed so that all data resides in one location (such as the organization's headquarters) and is replicated to the local sites. Changes at local sites could be replicated back to headquarters. If data is replicated to the local sites as read-only, the data in the client/server system is backed up at each local site. This means that if the headquarters server were to fail, data could still be accessed at the local sites over the WAN. Conversely, if data were...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nuploaded hourly from local sites to the headquarters' site, then the headquarters' server would act as a backup for the local servers.",

Conversely, if data were...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nuploaded hourly from local sites to the headquarters' site, then the headquarters' server would act as a backup for the local servers.\n\nAs the example above illustrates, the client/server system typically provides some inherent level of redundancy that can be incorporated in the contingency strategy. For example, consider a critical system that is distributed between an organization's headquarters and a small office. Assuming data is replicated at both sites, a cost-effective recovery strategy may be to establish a reciprocal agreement between the two sites. Under this agreement, in the event of a disruption at one office, essential personnel would relocate to the other office to continue to process system functions. This strategy could save significant contingency costs by avoiding the need to procure and equip alternate sites.\n\nIf considering the use of remote sites for system backups, or the use of Internet or other means of backup, the ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the remotely hosted storage services can provide the same level of protection of data as the original site. This can be done through SLAs and periodic reviews and assessments of the remote storage facility and processes.\n\n## 5.3 Telecommunications Systems\n\nThere are two primary classes of telecommunications systems: LANs and WANs. Wireless connectivity, prevalent for use with portable devices, can be used in either LAN or WAN environments.\n\nA LAN is located within an office or campus environment. It can be as small as two PCs attached to a single network switch, or it may support hundreds of users and multiple servers. LANs can be developed using any of several topologies. Each connection on a LAN is considered a node.",

It can be as small as two PCs attached to a single network switch, or it may support hundreds of users and multiple servers. LANs can be developed using any of several topologies. Each connection on a LAN is considered a node.\n\nA WAN is a data communications network that consists of connecting two or more systems that are dispersed over a wide geographical area. Communications links, usually provided by a public carrier, provide the connection to enable one system to interact with other systems. WANs can connect LANs together, connect to mainframe systems, and connect client computers to servers. WANs provide much of the communications requirements of geographically dispersed environments. Types of WAN communications links include the following methods:\n\n- **T-1.** T-1 is a dedicated phone connection supporting data rates of 1.544 Megabits per second (Mbps). A T-1 line consists of 24 individual 64-kbps channels, and each channel can be configured to carry voice or data signals. Fractional T-1 communications links also can be provided when multiples of 64-kbps lines are required.\n\n- **T-3.** T-3 is a dedicated phone connection supporting data rates of about 45 Mbps. A T-3 line consists of 672 individual channels, each of which supports 64 kbps. T-3 is also referred to as a Digital Signal (DS) 3.\n\n- **Frame Relay.** Frame relay is a packet-switching protocol for connecting devices on a WAN.

Implementations of ATM support data transfer rates of from```markdown\n# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n25 to 622 Mbps and provide guaranteed throughput.\n\n## Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)\n\nSONET is the standard for synchronous data transmission on optical media. SONET supports gigabit transmission rates.\n\n### 5.3.1 Telecommunications Contingency Considerations\n\nWhen developing the telecommunications recovery strategy, the ISCP Coordinator should apply considerations that were provided in Section 5.2.1 regarding client/server systems. In addition, the following practices should be considered:\n\n- **Telecommunications documentation.** Physical and logical telecommunications diagrams should be up to date. The physical diagram should display the physical layout of the facility that houses the LAN and/or WAN, and cable jack numbers should be documented on the physical diagram. Diagrams should also identify network-connecting devices, IP addresses, Domain Name System (DNS) names, and types of communications links and vendors.

Vendors and their contact information should be documented in the contingency plan to provide for prompt hardware and software repair or replacement. The plan also should document the communications providers, including POC and contractual or SLA information.\n\n## TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONTINGENCY STRATEGIES:\n\n- DOCUMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS.\n- COORDINATE WITH VENDORS.\n- COORDINATE WITH SECURITY POLICIES AND CONTROLS.\n- IDENTIFY SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE.\n- IMPLEMENT REDUNDANCY IN CRITICAL COMPONENTS.\n- MONITOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS.\n- INTEGRATE REMOTE ACCESS AND WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORK TECHNOLOGY.\n\n- Coordinate with security policies and security controls.

Impacts and priorities discovered through the BIA of associated systems should be reviewed to determine telecommunications recovery priorities. The BIA should identify the high-availability FIPS 199 impact levels for any data networks and email that support COOP Mission, Primary, or National Essential Functions.\n\n## 5.3.2 Telecommunications Contingency Solutions\n\nWhile similar contingencies exist for both LAN and WAN telecommunications systems, there are different strategies and solutions the ISCP Coordinator should consider when determining an overall telecommunications recovery strategy. Differences in solutions primarily exist due to geographic and connectivity ownership. While LANs are typically in small areas (offices or campuses) and the routing and wiring is owned or managed by the organization, WANs typically rely on network service providers (NSPs) for both routing and wiring.\n\nWhen developing an ISCP for a LAN, the ISCP Coordinator should identify single points of failure that affect critical systems or processes outlined in the BIA. This analysis could include threats to the cabling system, such as cable cuts, electromagnetic and radio frequency interference, and damage resulting from fire, water, and other hazards. As a solution, redundant cables may be installed when appropriate. For example, it might not be cost-effective to install duplicate cables to desktops. However, it might be cost-effective to install a gigabit cable between floors so that hosts on both floors could be reconnected if the primary cable were cut.",

However, it might be cost-effective to install a gigabit cable between floors so that hosts on both floors could be reconnected if the primary cable were cut.\n\nContingency planning also should consider network-connecting devices, such as hubs, switches, routers, and bridges. The BIA should characterize the roles that each device serves in the network, and a contingency solution should be developed for each device based on its BIA criticality. As an example of a contingency strategy for network-connecting devices, redundant intelligent network routers may be installed in a network, enabling a router to assume the full traffic workload if the other router failed.\n\nRemote access is a service provided by servers and devices on the LAN. Remote access provides a convenience for users working offsite or allows for a means for servers and devices to communicate between sites. Remote access can be conducted through various methods, primarily through a virtual private network (VPN). If an emergency or serious system disruption occurs, remote access may serve as an important contingency capability by providing access to organization-wide data for recovery teams or users from another location. If remote access is established as a contingency strategy, data bandwidth requirements should be identified and used to scale the remote access solution. Additionally, security controls such as multifactor authentication and data encryption should be implemented if the communications contain FIPS 199 moderate- or high-impact information. Remote access will work only if the remote access server and the network are both functioning at either the primary or the alternate.# Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)\n\nWireless (or WiFi) local area networks can serve as an effective contingency solution to restore network services following a wired LAN disruption. Wireless networks do not require the cabling infrastructure of conventional LANs; therefore, they may be installed quickly as an interim or permanent solution.",
  "Wireless (or WiFi) local area networks can serve as an effective contingency solution to restore network services following a wired LAN disruption. Wireless networks do not require the cabling infrastructure of conventional LANs; therefore, they may be installed quickly as an interim or permanent solution.\n\nHowever, wireless networks broadcast data over a radio signal, enabling the data to be intercepted. When implementing a wireless network, security controls, such as data encryption, should be employed if the communications traffic contains FIPS 199 moderate- or high-impact information. Wireless LANs allow for quick temporary access of portable devices, which typically have wireless antennae built into them. Wireless routers commonly provide password authentication and transmission encryption as standard features.\n\n## Remote Connectivity Security Requirements\n\nFor organizations considering remote connectivity, several security requirements and guidelines must be implemented. This includes verification of a user's identity through electronic authentication, or e-authentication. E-authentication guidelines provide four basic levels of protection, from minimal identity verification (Level 1) to cryptographic two-factor authentication keys (Level 4). NIST SP 800-63, Electronic Authentication Guideline, provides more information on the four levels and implementing e-authentication into a system.\n\n## WAN Contingency Solutions\n\nWAN contingency solutions include all of the measures discussed for client/server systems and LANs. In addition, WAN contingency planning must consider the communications links that connect the disparate systems. WAN contingency strategies are influenced by the type of data routed on the network. A WAN that hosts a mission-critical system (see Section 5.4) may require a more robust recovery strategy than a WAN that connects multiple LANs for simple resource-sharing purposes.\n\nOrganizations should consider the following contingency solutions for ensuring WAN availability:\n\n- **Redundant communications links.** Redundant communications links usually are necessary when the network processes critical data. The redundant links could be the same type, such as two T-1 connections, or the backup link could provide reduced bandwidth to accommodate only critical transmissions in a contingency situation. For example, an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) line with a bandwidth of 128Kbps could be used as a contingency communications link for a primary T-1 connection. If redundant links are used, the ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the links have physical separation and do not follow the same path; otherwise, a single incident, such as a cable cut, could disrupt both links.",

If redundant links are used, the ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the links have physical separation and do not follow the same path; otherwise, a single incident, such as a cable cut, could disrupt both links.\n\n- **Redundant network service providers.** If near 100 percent connectivity is required, redundant communications links can be provided through multiple NSPs. If this solution is chosen, the ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the NSPs do not share common facilities at any point, including building entries or demarcations (places where the WAN connection ends within a facility).\n\n- **Redundant network-connecting devices.** Duplicate network-connecting devices, such as...# High Availability and Redundancy\n\nRouters, switches, and firewalls can create high availability at the LAN interfaces and provide redundancy if one device fails. Duplicate devices also provide load balancing in routing traffic.\n\n- **Redundancy from NSP or Internet Service Provider (ISP)**. The ISCP Coordinator should consult with the selected NSP or ISP to assess the robustness and reliability within their core networks (e.g., redundant network-connecting devices and power protection).\n\nTo reduce the effects of a telecommunications disruption through prompt detection, monitoring software can be installed.

The monitoring software can facilitate troubleshooting and often provides the administrator with a warning before users and other nodes notice problems.

An SLA also may be developed with the NSP or ISP to guarantee the desired network availability and establish tariffs if the vendor's network is unavailable. If the NSP or ISP is contracted to provide network-connecting devices, such as routers, the availability of these devices should be included in the SLA.\n\n## 5.4 Mainframe Systems\n\nUnlike the client/server architecture, the mainframe architecture is centralized. The clients that access the mainframe are terminals with no processing or data storage capabilities. All the processing power for the system is within the mainframe itself. The terminals accept output only from the mainframe. Early on, these terminals were primarily monitors and keyboards without processors. Now, however, mainframes normally do not have traditional terminals. Instead, desktops and portable computers access mainframes through the use of terminal emulation software.\n\nA mainframe is a multiuser computer designed to meet the computing needs of a large organization.

Because a mainframe uses a centralized architecture, the mainframe does not have the inherent redundancy that a distributed system or network provides. As a result, mainframe availability and data backups are critical. The following measures should be considered when determining mainframe contingency requirements:\n\n- Store backup media offsite. Backup media should be labeled, logged, and stored offsite in a secure, environmentally controlled facility. The storage facility should be located far enough away from the original site to reduce the likelihood that both sites would be affected by the same disaster.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Event\nAdditionally, depending on the FIPS 199 impact level, data encryption may be required for protecting system backup information while in transit and at rest to minimize the risk if backup media is lost or stolen.\n\n- Document system configurations and vendors. Maintaining detailed records of system configurations enhances system recovery capabilities. In addition, vendors that supply essential hardware, software, and other components should be identified in the contingency plan.\n- Coordinate with network security policy and system security controls. Mainframe contingency solutions should include duplicating interfaces and telecommunications infrastructure as well as coordinating with network security policies, such as stringent access controls.\n- Utilize results from the BIA. Impacts and priorities identified through the BIA of associated systems supporting organizational critical mission/business processes should be reviewed to determine recovery requirements and priorities.",

Contingency strategies should emphasize the mainframe's data storage capabilities and underlying architecture. Redundant system components are critical to ensure that a failure of a system component, such as a power supply, does not cause a system failure. UPS and power monitoring and management systems also should be used to ensure that power fluctuation will not affect the mainframe. Because mainframes typically process large critical applications, a long-term backup power solution may be needed. A gas or diesel generator can ensure that mainframe processing is not interrupted by a power outage.\n\nDisk redundancy can be provided for the direct access storage devices (DASDs) by implementing a RAID solution. Because each mainframe architecture is unique and centralized, a contingency strategy is to have a replacement system available at an alternate warm or hot site. Since backup mainframe platforms are very costly to purchase and maintain, many agencies share commercial systems. Agencies also typically maintain vendor-support contracts to repair damaged units. However, vendor support alone may not restore system functions within the allowable outage time. In all cases, vendor SLAs should be kept up to date and reviewed to ensure that the vendor provides adequate support to meet system availability requirements.",

Backup and retention schedules should be based on the criticality of the data being processed and the frequency that the data is modified. (See Section 5.2.2 for backup solutions.) As with servers, remote journaling or electronic vaulting to the alternate site could be an effective technical contingency solution. In addition, disk replication, virtualization, or NAS or SAN technologies that replicate.# Various Platforms to One\n\nReplicating server could be used in some cases.\n\n## 5.5 System Contingency Planning Considerations Summary\n\nFor information system contingency planning, the ISCP Coordinator should consider technical measures from two perspectives when planning a system recovery strategy:\n\n- **Contingency considerations** discuss technical requirements or factors to complement the contingency solution.\n- **Contingency solutions** are technically based and are used to implement the contingency strategy.\n\nTable 5-1 provides a summary of contingency considerations and solutions."
