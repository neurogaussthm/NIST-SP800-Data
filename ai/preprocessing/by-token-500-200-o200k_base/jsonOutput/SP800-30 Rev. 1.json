Organizations have maximum flexibility on how risk assessments are conducted and are encouraged to apply the guidance in this document so that the various needs of organizations can be addressed and the risk assessment activities can be integrated into broader organizational risk management processes.\n- Organizations are also cautioned that risk assessments are often not precise instruments of measurement and reflect: (i) the limitations of the specific assessment methodologies, tools, and techniques employed; (ii) the subjectivity, quality, and trustworthiness of the data used; (iii) the interpretation of assessment results; and (iv) the skills and expertise of those individuals or groups conducting the assessments.\n- Since cost, timeliness, and ease of use are a few of the many important factors in the application of risk assessments, organizations should attempt to reduce the level of effort for risk assessments by sharing risk-related information, whenever possible.\n\n# CHAPTER ONE\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n### THE NEED FOR RISK ASSESSMENTS TO SUPPORT ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT",
  "# CHAPTER ONE\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n### THE NEED FOR RISK ASSESSMENTS TO SUPPORT ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOrganizations in the public and private sectors depend on information technology and information systems to successfully carry out their missions and business functions. Information systems can include very diverse entities ranging from office networks, financial and personnel systems to very specialized systems (e.g., industrial/process control systems, weapons systems, telecommunications systems, and environmental control systems). Information systems are subject to serious threats that can have adverse effects on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation by exploiting both known and unknown vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. Threats to information systems can include purposeful attacks, environmental disruptions, human/machine errors, and\n```# Structural Failures and Information Security Risk\n\nStructural failures can result in harm to the national and economic security interests of the United States. Therefore, it is imperative that leaders and managers at all levels understand their responsibilities and are held accountable for managing information security risk\u2014that is, the risk associated with the operation and use of information systems that support the missions and business functions of their organizations.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nRisk assessment is one of the fundamental components of an organizational risk management process as described in NIST Special Publication 800-39. Risk assessments are used to identify, estimate, and prioritize risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the operation and use of information systems. The purpose of risk assessments is to inform decision makers and support risk responses by identifying:\n\n1. Relevant threats to organizations or threats directed through organizations against other organizations;\n2. Vulnerabilities both internal and external to organizations;\n3. Impact (i.e., harm) to organizations that may occur given the potential for threats exploiting vulnerabilities; and\n4. Likelihood that harm will occur.",

Impact (i.e., harm) to organizations that may occur given the potential for threats exploiting vulnerabilities; and\n4. Likelihood that harm will occur.\n\nThe end result is a determination of risk (i.e., typically a function of the degree of harm and likelihood of harm occurring). Risk assessments can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy\u2014including Tier 1 (organization level), Tier 2 (mission/business process level), and Tier 3 (information system level). At Tiers 1 and 2, organizations use risk assessments to evaluate, for example, systemic information security-related risks associated with organizational governance and management activities, mission/business processes, enterprise architecture, or the funding of information security programs. At Tier 3, organizations use risk assessments to more effectively support the implementation of the Risk Management Framework (i.e., security categorization; security control selection, implementation, and assessment; information system and common control authorization; and security control monitoring).\n\n## 1.1 Purpose and Applicability\n\nThe purpose of Special Publication 800-30 is to provide guidance for conducting risk assessments of federal information systems and organizations, amplifying the guidance in Special Publication 800-39. Risk assessments, carried out at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy, are part of an overall risk management process\u2014providing senior leaders/executives with the information needed to determine appropriate courses of action in response to identified risks.

Risk Management Process\nRisk assessment is a key component of a holistic, organization-wide risk management process as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View. Risk management processes include:\n1. Framing risk\n2. Assessing risk\n3. Responding to risk\n4. Monitoring risk\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the four steps in the risk management process\u2014including the risk assessment step and the information and communications flows necessary to make the process work effectively.\n\n### 2.1 Framing Risk\nThe first component of risk management addresses how organizations frame risk or establish a risk context\u2014that is, describing the environment in which risk-based decisions are made. The purpose of the risk framing component is to produce a risk management strategy that addresses how organizations intend to assess risk, respond to risk, and monitor risk\u2014making explicit and transparent the risk perceptions that organizations routinely use in making both investment and operational decisions. The risk management strategy establishes a foundation for managing risk and delineates the boundaries for risk-based decisions within organizations.\n\n### 2.2 Assessing Risk\nThe second component of risk management addresses how organizations assess risk within the context of the organizational risk frame. The purpose of the risk assessment component is to identify:\n1. Threats to organizations (i.e., operations, assets, or individuals) or threats directed through organizations against other organizations or the Nation\n2. Vulnerabilities internal and external to organizations\n3. The harm (i.e., adverse impact) that may occur given the potential for threats exploiting vulnerabilities\n4. The likelihood that harm will occur\n\nThe end result is a determination of risk (i.e., typically a function of the degree of harm and likelihood of harm occurring).",

The purpose of the risk response component is to provide a consistent, organization-wide response to risk in accordance with the organizational risk frame by:\n1. Developing alternative courses of action for responding to risk\n2. Evaluating the alternative courses of action\n3. Determining appropriate courses of action consistent with organizational risk tolerance\n4. Implementing risk responses based on selected courses of action\n\n### 2.4 Monitoring Risk\nThe fourth component of risk management addresses how organizations monitor risk over time.

Information security risks are those risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems and reflect the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Risk assessment is the process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing information security risks. Assessing risk requires the careful analysis of threat and vulnerability information to determine the extent to which circumstances or events could adversely impact an organization and the likelihood that such circumstances or events will occur.\n\nA risk assessment methodology typically includes: (i) a risk assessment process (as described in Chapter Three); (ii) an explicit risk model, defining key terms and assessable risk factors and the relationships among the factors; (iii) an assessment approach (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, or semi-qualitative), specifying the range of values those risk factors can assume during the risk assessment and how combinations of risk factors are identified/analyzed so that values of those factors can be functionally combined to evaluate risk; and (iv) an analysis approach (e.g., threat-oriented, asset/impact-oriented, or vulnerability-oriented), describing how combinations of risk factors are identified/analyzed to ensure adequate coverage of the problem space at a consistent level of detail. Risk assessment methodologies are defined by organizations and are a component of the risk management strategy developed during the risk framing step of the risk management process.

Risk factors are characteristics used in risk models as inputs to determining levels of risk in risk assessments. Risk factors are also used extensively in risk communications to highlight what strongly affects the levels of risk in particular situations, circumstances, or contexts. Typical risk factors include threat, vulnerability, impact, likelihood, and predisposing condition. Risk factors can be decomposed into more detailed characteristics (e.g., threats decomposed into threat sources and threat events). These definitions are important for organizations to document prior to conducting risk assessments because the assessments rely upon well-defined attributes of threats, vulnerabilities, impact, and other risk factors to effectively determine risk.\n\n### Threats\n\nA threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or denial of service. Threat events are caused by threat sources. A threat source is characterized as:\n\n(i) the intent and method targeted at the exploitation of a vulnerability; or\n(ii) a situation and method that may accidentally exploit a vulnerability.\n\nIn general, types of threat sources include:\n\n(i) hostile cyber or physical attacks;\n(ii) human errors of omission or commission;\n(iii) structural failures of organization-controlled resources (e.g., hardware, software, environmental controls);\nand\n(iv) natural and man-made disasters, accidents, and failures beyond the control of the organization.",

Some taxonomies of threat sources use the type of adverse impacts as an organizing principle. Multiple threat sources can initiate or cause the same threat event\u2014for example, a provisioning server can be taken off-line by a denial-of-service attack, a deliberate act by a malicious system administrator, an administrative error, a hardware fault, or a power failure.\n\nRisk models differ in the degree of detail and complexity with which threat events are identified. When threat events are identified with great specificity, threat scenarios can be modeled, developed, and analyzed. Threat events for cyber or physical attacks are characterized by the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by adversaries. Understanding adversary-based threat events gives organizations insights into the capabilities associated with certain threat sources. In addition, having greater knowledge about who is carrying out the attacks gives organizations a better understanding of what adversaries desire to gain by the attacks. Knowing# The Intent and Targeting Aspects of a Potential Attack\n\nThe intent and targeting aspects of a potential attack helps organizations narrow the set of threat events that are most relevant to consider.\n\n## Threat Shifting\n\nThreat shifting is the response of adversaries to perceived safeguards and/or countermeasures (i.e., security controls), in which adversaries change some characteristic of their intent/targeting in order to avoid and/or overcome those safeguards/countermeasures.

  "The intent and targeting aspects of a potential attack helps organizations narrow the set of threat events that are most relevant to consider.\n\n## Threat Shifting\n\nThreat shifting is the response of adversaries to perceived safeguards and/or countermeasures (i.e., security controls), in which adversaries change some characteristic of their intent/targeting in order to avoid and/or overcome those safeguards/countermeasures. Threat shifting can occur in one or more domains including:\n\n1. **The time domain** (e.g., a delay in an attack or illegal entry to conduct additional surveillance);\n2. **The target domain** (e.g., selecting a different target that is not as well protected);\n3. **The resource domain** (e.g., adding resources to the attack in order to reduce uncertainty or overcome safeguards and/or countermeasures);\n4. **The attack planning/attack method domain** (e.g., changing the attack weapon or attack path).\n\nThreat shifting is a natural consequence of a dynamic set of interactions between threat sources and types of organizational assets targeted. With more sophisticated threat sources, it also tends to default to the path of least resistance to exploit particular vulnerabilities, and the responses are not always predictable. In addition to the safeguards and/or countermeasures implemented and the impact of a successful exploit of an organizational vulnerability, another influence on threat shifting is the benefit to the attacker. That perceived benefit on the attacker side can also influence how much and when threat shifting occurs.\n\n## Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions\n\nA vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. Most information system vulnerabilities can be associated with security controls that either have not been applied (either intentionally or unintentionally), or have been applied, but retain some weakness. However, it is also important to allow for the possibility of emergent vulnerabilities that can arise naturally over time as organizational missions/business functions evolve, environments of operation change, new technologies proliferate, and new threats emerge.\n\nIn the context of such change, existing security controls may become inadequate and may need to be reassessed for effectiveness. The tendency for security controls to potentially degrade in effectiveness over time reinforces the need to maintain risk assessments during the entire system development life cycle and also the importance of continuous monitoring programs to obtain ongoing situational awareness of the organizational security posture.",

The tendency for security controls to potentially degrade in effectiveness over time reinforces the need to maintain risk assessments during the entire system development life cycle and also the importance of continuous monitoring programs to obtain ongoing situational awareness of the organizational security posture.\n\nVulnerabilities are not identified only within information systems. Viewing information systems in a broader context, vulnerabilities can be found in organizational governance structures (e.g., the lack of effective risk management strategies and adequate risk framing, poor intra-agency communications, inconsistent decisions about relative priorities of missions/business functions, or...# Misalignment of Enterprise Architecture\n\nMisalignment of enterprise architecture to support mission/business activities. Vulnerabilities can also be found in external relationships (e.g., dependencies on particular energy sources, supply chains, information technologies, and telecommunications providers), mission/business processes (e.g., poorly defined processes or processes that are not risk-aware), and enterprise/information security architectures (e.g., poor architectural decisions resulting in lack of diversity or resiliency in organizational information systems).\n\nIn general, risks materialize as a result of a series of threat events, each of which takes advantage of one or more vulnerabilities. Organizations define threat scenarios to describe how the events caused by a threat source can contribute to or cause harm. Development of threat scenarios is analytically useful, since some vulnerabilities may not be exposed to exploitation unless and until other vulnerabilities have been exploited. Analysis that illuminates how a set of vulnerabilities, taken together, could be exploited by one or more threat events is therefore more useful than the analysis of individual vulnerabilities. In addition, a threat scenario tells a story, and hence is useful for risk communication as well as for analysis.\n\n## Predisposing Conditions",

A predisposing condition is a condition that exists within an organization, a mission or business process, enterprise architecture, information system, or environment of operation, which affects (i.e., increases or decreases) the likelihood that threat events, once initiated, result in adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Predisposing conditions include, for example, the location of a facility in a hurricane- or flood-prone region (increasing the likelihood of exposure to hurricanes or floods) or a stand-alone information system with no external network connectivity (decreasing the likelihood of exposure to a network-based cyber attack). Vulnerabilities resulting from predisposing conditions that cannot be easily corrected could include, for example, gaps in contingency plans, use of outdated technologies, or weaknesses/deficiencies in information system backup and failover mechanisms.\n\nIn all cases, these types of vulnerabilities create a predisposition toward threat events having adverse impacts on organizations. Vulnerabilities (including those attributed to predisposing conditions) are part of the overall security posture of organizational information systems and environments of operation that can affect the likelihood of occurrence of a threat event.\n\n## Likelihood\n\nThe likelihood of occurrence is a weighted risk factor based on an analysis of the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability (or set of vulnerabilities). The likelihood risk factor combines an estimate of the likelihood that the threat event will be initiated with an estimate of the likelihood of impact (i.e., the likelihood that the...# Threat Event Assessment\n\nThreat event results in adverse impacts.

For adversarial threats, an assessment of likelihood of occurrence is typically based on:\n\n1. Adversary intent\n2. Adversary capability\n3. Adversary targeting\n\nFor other than adversarial threat events, the likelihood of occurrence is estimated using historical evidence, empirical data, or other factors. Note that the likelihood that a threat event will be initiated or will occur is assessed with respect to a specific time frame (e.g., the next six months, the next year, or the period until a specified milestone is reached). If a threat event is almost certain to be initiated or occur in the (specified or implicit) time frame, the risk assessment may take into consideration the estimated frequency of the event.\n\nThe likelihood of threat occurrence can also be based on the state of the organization (including for example, its core mission/business processes, enterprise architecture, information security architecture, information systems, and environments in which those systems operate)\u2014taking into consideration predisposing conditions and the presence and effectiveness of deployed security controls to protect against unauthorized/undesirable behavior, detect and limit damage, and/or maintain or restore mission/business capabilities.\n\nThe likelihood of impact addresses the probability (or possibility) that the threat event will result in an adverse impact, regardless of the magnitude of harm that can be expected. Organizations typically employ a three-step process to determine the overall likelihood of threat events.",

Organizations typically employ a three-step process to determine the overall likelihood of threat events.\n\n1. First, organizations assess the likelihood that threat events will be initiated (for adversarial threat events) or will occur (for non-adversarial threat events).\n2. Second, organizations assess the likelihood that the threat events once initiated or occurring, will result in adverse impacts or harm to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation.\n3. Finally, organizations assess the overall likelihood as a combination of likelihood of initiation/occurrence and likelihood of resulting in adverse impact.\n\nThreat-vulnerability pairing (i.e., establishing a one-to-one relationship between threats and vulnerabilities) may be undesirable when assessing likelihood at the mission/business function level, and in many cases, can be problematic even at the information system level due to the potentially large number of threats and vulnerabilities. This approach typically drives the level of detail in identifying threat events and vulnerabilities, rather than allowing organizations to make effective use of threat information and/or to identify threats at a level of detail that is meaningful.\n\nDepending on the level of detail in threat specification, a given threat event could exploit multiple vulnerabilities. In assessing likelihoods, organizations examine vulnerabilities that threat events could exploit and also the mission/business function susceptibility to events for which no security controls or viable implementations of security controls exist (e.g., due to functional dependencies, particularly external dependencies).

Using the concept of threat scenarios described above may help organizations overcome some of the limitations of threat-vulnerability pairing.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe level of impact from a threat event is the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized modification of information, unauthorized destruction of information, or loss of information or information system availability. Such harm can be experienced by a variety of organizational and non-organizational stakeholders including, for example, heads of agencies, mission and business owners, information owners/stewards, mission/business process owners, information system owners, or individuals/groups in the public or private sectors relying on the organization\u2014in essence, anyone with a vested interest in the organization's operations, assets, or individuals, including other organizations in partnership with the organization, or the Nation.\n\nOrganizations make explicit:\n1. the process used to conduct impact determinations;\n2. assumptions related to impact determinations;\n3. sources and methods for obtaining impact information; and\n4. the rationale for conclusions reached with regard to impact determinations.\n\nOrganizations may explicitly define how established priorities and values guide the identification of high-value assets and the potential adverse impacts to organizational stakeholders. If such information is not defined, priorities and values related to identifying targets of threat sources and associated organizational impacts can typically be derived from strategic planning and policies.\n\nFor example, security categorization levels indicate the organizational impacts of compromising different types of information. Privacy Impact Assessments and criticality levels (when defined as part of contingency planning or Mission/Business Impact Analysis) indicate the adverse impacts of destruction, corruption, or loss of accountability for information resources to organizations. Strategic plans and policies also assert or imply the relative priorities of immediate or near-term mission/business function accomplishment and long-term organizational viability (which can be undermined by the loss of reputation or by sanctions resulting from the compromise of sensitive information).",

Strategic plans and policies also assert or imply the relative priorities of immediate or near-term mission/business function accomplishment and long-term organizational viability (which can be undermined by the loss of reputation or by sanctions resulting from the compromise of sensitive information).\n\nOrganizations can also consider the range of effects of threat events including the relative size of the set of resources affected, when making final impact determinations. Risk tolerance assumptions may state that threat events with an impact below a specific value do not warrant further analysis.\n\n## Risk\n\nFigure 3 illustrates an example of a risk model including the key risk factors discussed above and the relationship among the factors. Each of the risk factors is used in the risk.# Assessment Process\n\nIn Chapter Three.\n\nAs noted above, risk is a function of the likelihood of a threat event's occurrence and potential adverse impact should the event occur. This definition accommodates many types of adverse impacts at all tiers in the risk management hierarchy described in Special Publication 800-39 (e.g., damage to image or reputation of the organization or financial loss at Tier 1; inability to successfully execute a specific mission/business process at Tier 2; or the resources expended in responding to an information system incident at Tier 3). It also accommodates relationships among impacts (e.g., loss of current or future mission/business effectiveness due to the loss of data confidentiality; loss of confidence in critical information due to loss of data or system integrity; or unavailability or degradation of information or information systems). This broad definition also allows risk to be represented as a single value or as a vector (i.e., multiple values), in which different types of impacts are assessed separately. For purposes of risk communication, risk is generally grouped according to the types of adverse impacts (and possibly the time frames in which those impacts are likely to be experienced).\n\n## Aggregation",
  "## Aggregation\n\nOrganizations may use risk aggregation to roll up several discrete or lower-level risks into a more general or higher-level risk. Organizations may also use risk aggregation to efficiently manage the scope and scale of risk assessments involving multiple information systems and multiple mission/business processes with specified relationships and dependencies among those systems and processes. Risk aggregation, conducted primarily at Tiers 1 and 2 and occasionally at Tier 3, assesses the overall risk to organizational operations, assets, and individuals given the set of discrete risks. In general, for discrete risks (e.g., the risk associated with a single information system supporting a well-defined mission/business process), the worst-case impact establishes an upper bound for the overall risk to organizational operations, assets, and individuals. One issue for risk aggregation is that this upper bound for risk may fail to apply. For example, it may be advantageous for organizations to assess risk at the organization level when multiple risks materialize concurrently or when the same risk materializes repeatedly over a period of time. In such situations, there is the possibility that the amount of overall risk incurred is beyond the risk capacity of the organization, and therefore the overall impact to organizational operations and assets (i.e., mission/business impact) goes beyond that which was originally assessed for each specific risk.\n\nWhen aggregating risk, organizations consider the relationship among various discrete risks. For example, there may be a cause and effect relationship in that if one risk materializes, another risk is more or less likely to materialize. If there is a direct or inverse...# Relationship Among Discrete Risks\n\nThen the risks can be coupled (in a qualitative sense) or correlated (in a quantitative sense) either in a positive or negative manner. Risk coupling or correlation (i.e., finding relationships among risks that increase or decrease the likelihood of any specific risk materializing) can be done at Tiers 1, 2, or 3.\n\n## Uncertainty\n\nUncertainty is inherent in the evaluation of risk, due to such considerations as:\n(i) limitations on the extent to which the future will resemble the past;\n(ii) imperfect or incomplete knowledge of the threat (e.g., characteristics of adversaries including tactics, techniques, and procedures);\n(iii) undiscovered vulnerabilities in technologies or products; and\n(iv) unrecognized dependencies, which can lead to unforeseen impacts.",

For example, at early phases in the system development life cycle, the presence and effectiveness of security controls may be unknown, while at later phases in the life cycle, the cost of evaluating control effectiveness may outweigh the benefits in terms of more fully informed decision making.\n\nFinally, uncertainty can be due to incomplete knowledge of the risks associated with other information systems, mission/business processes, services, common infrastructures, and/or organizations. The degree of uncertainty in risk assessment results, due to these different reasons, can be communicated in the form of the results (e.g., by expressing results qualitatively, by providing ranges of values rather than single values for identified risks, or by using visual representations of fuzzy regions rather than points).\n\n## 2.3.2 Assessment Approaches\n\nRisk, and its contributing factors, can be assessed in a variety of ways, including quantitatively, qualitatively, or semi-quantitatively. Each risk assessment approach considered by organizations has advantages and disadvantages. A preferred approach (or situation-specific set of approaches) can be selected based on organizational culture and, in particular, attitudes toward the concepts of uncertainty and risk communication.\n\nQuantitative assessments typically employ a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing risk based on the use of numbers\u2014where the meanings and proportionality of values are maintained inside and outside the context of the assessment.

This type of assessment most effectively supports cost-benefit analyses of alternative risk responses or courses of action.\n\nHowever, the meaning of the quantitative results may not always be clear and may require interpretation and explanation\u2014particularly to explain the assumptions and constraints on using the results. For example, organizations may typically ask if the numbers or results obtained in the risk assessments are reliable or if the differences in the obtained values are meaningful or insignificant. Additionally, the rigor of quantification is...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Significantly Lessened\n\nWhen subjective determinations are buried within the quantitative assessments, or when significant uncertainty surrounds the determination of values. The benefits of quantitative assessments (in terms of the rigor, repeatability, and reproducibility of assessment results) can, in some cases, be outweighed by the costs (in terms of the expert time and effort and the possible deployment and use of tools required to make such assessments).\n\n## Qualitative Assessments\n\nIn contrast to quantitative assessments, qualitative assessments typically employ a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing risk based on nonnumerical categories or levels (e.g., very low, low, moderate, high, very high). This type of assessment supports communicating risk results to decision makers. However, the range of values in qualitative assessments is comparatively small in most cases, making the relative prioritization or comparison within the set of reported risks difficult. Additionally, unless each value is very clearly defined or is characterized by meaningful examples, different experts relying on their individual experiences could produce significantly different assessment results. The repeatability and reproducibility of qualitative assessments are increased by the annotation of assessed values (e.g., this value is high because of the following reasons) and by the use of tables or other well-defined functions to combine qualitative values.\n\n## Semi-Quantitative Assessments",

This type of assessment can provide the benefits of quantitative and qualitative assessments. The bins (e.g., 0-15, 16-35, 36-70, 71-85, 86-100) or scales (e.g., 1-10) translate easily into qualitative terms that support risk communications for decision makers (e.g., a score of 95 can be interpreted as very high), while also allowing relative comparisons between values in different bins or even within the same bin (e.g., the difference between risks scored 70 and 71 respectively is relatively insignificant, while the difference between risks scored 36 and 70 is relatively significant). The role of expert judgment in assigning values is more evident than in a purely quantitative approach. Moreover, if the scales or sets of bins provide sufficient granularity, relative prioritization among results is better supported than in a purely qualitative approach. As in a quantitative approach, rigor is significantly lessened when subjective determinations are buried within assessments, or when significant uncertainty surrounds a determination of value. As with the nonnumeric categories or levels used in a well-founded qualitative approach, each bin or range of values needs to be clearly defined and/or characterized by meaningful examples.\n\n## Temporal Element of Risk Factors",
  "## Temporal Element of Risk Factors\n\nIndependent of the type of value scale selected, assessments make explicit the temporal element of risk factors. For example, organizations can associate a specific time period with assessments.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## of likelihood of occurrence and assessments of impact severity.\n\n### 2.3.3 Analysis Approaches\n\nAnalysis approaches differ with respect to the orientation or starting point of the risk assessment, level of detail in the assessment, and how risks due to similar threat scenarios are treated. An analysis approach can be: (i) threat-oriented; (ii) asset/impact-oriented; or (iii) vulnerability-oriented. A threat-oriented approach starts with the identification of threat sources and threat events, and focuses on the development of threat scenarios; vulnerabilities are identified in the context of threats, and for adversarial threats, impacts are identified based on adversary intent. An asset/impact-oriented approach starts with the identification of impacts or consequences of concern and critical assets, possibly using the results of a mission or business impact analyses and identifying threat events that could lead to and/or threat sources that could seek those impacts or consequences. A vulnerability-oriented approach starts with a set of predisposing conditions or exploitable weaknesses/deficiencies in organizational information systems or the environments in which the systems operate, and identifies threat events that could exercise those vulnerabilities together with possible consequences of vulnerabilities being exercised. Each analysis approach takes into consideration the same risk factors, and thus entails the same set of risk assessment activities, albeit in different order. Differences in the starting point of the risk assessment can potentially bias the results, causing some risks not to be identified. Therefore, identification of risks from a second orientation (e.g., complementing a threat-oriented analysis approach with an asset/impact-oriented analysis approach) can improve the rigor and effectiveness of the analysis.",
  "In addition to the orientation of the analysis approach, organizations can apply more rigorous analysis techniques (e.g., graph-based analyses) to provide an effective way to account for the many-to-many relationships between: (i) threat sources and threat events (i.e., a single threat event can be caused by multiple threat sources and a single threat source can cause multiple threat events); (ii) threat events and vulnerabilities (i.e., a single threat event can exploit multiple vulnerabilities and a single vulnerability can be exploited by multiple threat events); and (iii) threat events and impacts/assets (i.e., a single threat event can affect multiple assets or have multiple impacts, and a single asset can be affected by multiple threat events). Rigorous analysis approaches also provide a way to account for whether, in the time frame for which risks are assessed, a specific adverse impact could occur (or a specific asset could be harmed) at most once, or perhaps repeatedly, depending on the nature of the impacts and on how organizations (including mission/business processes or information systems) recover from such adverse impacts.\n\n### 2.3.4 Effects of Organizational Culture on Risk Assessments\n\nOrganizations can differ in the risk models, assessment approaches, and analysis.# Approaches to Risk Models\n\nOrganizations may prefer different approaches for a variety of reasons. For example, cultural issues can predispose organizations to employ risk models that assume a constant value for one or more possible risk factors, so that some factors that are present in other organizations' models are not represented. Culture can also predispose organizations to employ risk models that require detailed analyses using quantitative assessments (e.g., nuclear safety). Alternately, organizations may prefer qualitative or semi-quantitative assessment approaches.\n\nIn addition to differences among organizations, differences can also exist within organizations. For example, organizations can use coarse or high-level risk models early in the system development life cycle to select security controls, and subsequently, more detailed models to assess risk to given missions or business functions. Organizational risk frames determine which risk models, assessment approaches, and analysis approaches to use under varying circumstances.\n\n## The Use of Risk Models",

Organizational risk frames determine which risk models, assessment approaches, and analysis approaches to use under varying circumstances.\n\n## The Use of Risk Models\n\nA single risk model (consisting of a fixed set of factors, a fixed assessment scale for each factor, and a fixed algorithm for combining factors) cannot meet the diverse needs of the organizations in the public and private sectors that rely on Special Publication 800-30. For example, while some organizations may emphasize adversarial threats and provide detailed information about such threats, other organizations may choose instead to focus on non-adversarial threats, providing greater detail for those types of threats and lesser detail for adversarial threats. Therefore, the risk models developed by organizations with different assumptions regarding threats will involve different factors as well as different levels of detail.\n\nSimilarly, within a single organization or community of interest, different assessment scales may be appropriate for different missions/business functions, different categories of information systems, and/or for systems at different stages in the system development life cycle. For example, during an initial risk assessment performed when an information system is first being considered, the information available about threats and vulnerabilities may be nonspecific and highly uncertain. For such risk assessments, a qualitative assessment, using only a few factors, may be appropriate. By contrast, a risk assessment informed by a security controls assessment can be far more specific, and estimates can be made with greater fidelity. For such assessments, a semi-quantitative assessment using the 0-100 value scales may be more appropriate.",

Special Publication 800-30 does identify risk factors that are common across a wide spectrum of risk.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nModels. In addition, by defining multiple aligned value scales, this publication provides a foundation for a consistent approach to estimating information security risk across the system development life cycle, without forcing assessments early in the life cycle to be more detailed than can be justified by available information.\n\n## 2.4 APPLICATION OF RISK ASSESSMENTS\n\nAs stated previously, risk assessments can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy\u2014organization level, mission/business process level, and information system level. Figure 4 illustrates the risk management hierarchy defined in NIST Special Publication 800-39, which provides multiple risk perspectives from the strategic level to the tactical level. Traditional risk assessments generally focus at the Tier 3 level (i.e., information system level) and as a result, tend to overlook other significant risk factors that may be more appropriately assessed at the Tier 1 or Tier 2 levels (e.g., exposure of a core mission/business function to an adversarial threat based on information system interconnections).",

At Tier 1, risk assessments can affect, for example:\n1. organization-wide information security programs, policies, procedures, and guidance;\n2. the types of appropriate risk responses (i.e., risk acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, sharing, or transfer);\n3. investment decisions for information technologies/systems;\n4. procurements;\n5. minimum organization-wide security controls;\n6. conformance to enterprise/security architectures; and\n7. monitoring strategies and ongoing authorizations of information systems and common controls.\n\nAt Tier 2, risk assessments can affect, for example:\n1. enterprise architecture/security architecture design decisions;\n2. the selection of common controls;\n3. the selection of suppliers, services, and contractors to support organizational missions/business functions;\n4. the development of risk-aware mission/business processes; and\n5. the interpretation of information security policies with respect to organizational information systems and environments in which those systems operate.\n\nFinally, at Tier 3, risk assessments can affect, for example:\n1. design decisions (including the selection, tailoring, and supplementation of security controls and the selection of information technology products for organizational information systems);\n2. implementation decisions (including whether specific information technology products or product configurations meet security control requirements); and\n3. operational decisions (including the requisite level of monitoring activity, the frequency of ongoing information system authorizations, and system maintenance decisions).",

Thus, the results of a risk assessment at a given tier serve as inputs to, and are aligned with, non-security risk management activities at that tier. In addition, the results of risk assessments at lower tiers serve as inputs to risk assessments at higher tiers. Risks can arise on different time scales (e.g., the disclosure of information about current organizational operations can compromise the effectiveness of those operations immediately, while the disclosure of strategic planning information can compromise future operational capabilities).\n\nRisk response decisions can also take effect in different time frames (e.g., changes in organizational policies or investment strategies can sometimes require years to take effect, while configuration changes in an individual system can often be implemented immediately).

However, some Tier 1 decisions (e.g., newly discovered threats or vulnerabilities requiring the implementation of an organization-wide mandate for mitigation) can involve immediate action.\n\n## 2.4.1 Risk Assessments at the Organizational Tier\n\nAt Tier 1, risk assessments support organizational strategies, policies, guidance, and processes for managing risk. Risk assessments conducted at Tier 1 focus on organizational operations, assets, and individuals\u2014comprehensive assessments across mission/business lines.\n\nFor example, Tier 1 risk assessments may address: (i) the specific types of threats directed at organizations that may be different from other organizations and how those threats affect policy decisions; (ii) systemic weaknesses or deficiencies discovered in multiple organizational information systems capable of being exploited by adversaries; (iii) the potential adverse impact on...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Organizations from the Loss or Compromise of Organizational Information\n\nOrganizations from the loss or compromise of organizational information (either intentionally or unintentionally); and (iv) the use of new information and computing technologies such as mobile and cloud and the potential effect on the ability of organizations to successfully carry out their missions/business operations while using those technologies.\n\nOrganization-wide assessments of risk can be based solely on the assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, priorities, and trade-offs established in the risk framing step (i.e., derived primarily from Tier 1 activities). However, more realistic and meaningful risk assessments are based on assessments conducted across multiple mission/business lines (i.e., derived primarily from Tier 2 activities).\n\nThe ability of organizations to effectively use Tier 2 risk assessments as inputs to Tier 1 risk assessments is shaped by such considerations as: (i) the similarity of organizational missions/business functions and mission/business processes; and (ii) the degree of autonomy that organizational entities or subcomponents have with respect to parent organizations.",

Finally, risk assessments at Tier 1 take into consideration the identification of mission-essential functions from Continuity of Operations Plans (COOP) prepared by organizations when determining the contribution of Tier 2 risks.\n\nRisk assessment results at Tier 1 are communicated to organizational entities at Tier 2 and Tier 3.\n\n## 2.4.2 Risk Assessments at the Mission/Business Process Tier\n\nAt Tier 2, risk assessments support the determination of mission/business process protection and resiliency requirements, and the allocation of those requirements to the enterprise architecture as part of mission/business segments (that support mission/business processes).\n\nThis allocation is accomplished through an information security architecture embedded within the enterprise architecture. Tier 2 risk assessments also inform and guide decisions on whether, how, and when to use information systems for specific mission/business processes, in particular for alternative mission/business processing in the face of compromised information systems.\n\nRisk management and associated risk assessment activities at Tier 2 are closely aligned with the development of Business Continuity Plans (BCPs).

While initial risk assessments (i.e., risk assessments performed for the first time, rather than updating prior risk assessments) can be performed at any phase in the system development life cycle, ideally these assessments should be performed in the Initiation phase. In the Initiation phase, risk assessments evaluate the anticipated vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems in the context of the planned environments of operation.

Such assessments inform risk response, enabling information system owners/program managers, together with mission/business owners to make the final decisions about the security controls necessary based on the security categorization and the environment of operation.\n\nRisk assessments are also conducted at later phases in the system development life cycle, updating risk assessment results from earlier phases. These risk assessment results for as-built or as-deployed information systems typically include descriptions of vulnerabilities in the systems, an assessment of the risks associated with each vulnerability (thereby updating the assessment of vulnerability severity), and corrective actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. The risk assessment results also include an assessment of the overall risk to the organization and the information contained in the information systems by operating the systems as evaluated. Risk assessment results at Tier 3 are communicated to organizational entities at Tier 1 and Tier 2.\n\nRisk assessment activities can be integrated with the steps in the Risk Management Framework (RMF), as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-37. The RMF, in its system development life cycle approach, operates primarily at Tier 3 with some application at Tiers 1 and 2, for example, in the selection of common controls. Risk assessments can be tailored to each step in the RMF as reflected in the purpose and scope of the assessments described in Section 3.1. Risk assessments can also help determine the type of security assessments conducted during various phases of the system development life cycle, the frequency of such assessments, the level of rigor applied during the assessments, the assessment methods used, and the types/number of objects assessed. The benefit of risk assessments conducted as part of the RMF can be realized from both initial\n```# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Assessments\n\nand from updated assessments, as described below.\n\n### RMF Step 1 \u2013 Categorize",
  "## Assessments\n\nand from updated assessments, as described below.\n\n### RMF Step 1 \u2013 Categorize\n\nOrganizations can use initial risk assessments to make security categorization decisions consistent with the risk management strategy provided by the risk executive (function) and as a preparatory step to security control selection. Conducting initial risk assessments brings together the available information on threat sources, threat events, vulnerabilities, and predisposing conditions\u2014thus enabling organizations to use such information to categorize information and information systems based on known and potential threats to and vulnerabilities in organizational information systems and environments in which those systems operate. Security categorization decisions inform the selection of initial baseline security controls. Baseline security controls serve as the starting point for organizational tailoring and supplementation activities described in the RMF Select step.\n\n### RMF Step 2 \u2013 Select\n\nOrganizations can use risk assessments to inform and guide the selection of security controls for organizational information systems and environments of operation. After the initial security control baseline is selected based on the security categorization process, the risk assessment results help organizations: (i) apply appropriate tailoring guidance to adjust the controls based on specific mission/business requirements, assumptions, constraints, priorities, trade-offs, or other organization-defined conditions; and (ii) supplement the controls based on specific and credible threat information. Threat data from risk assessments provide critical information on adversary capabilities, intent, and targeting that may affect the decisions by organizations regarding the selection of additional security controls including the associated costs and benefits. Organizations also consider risk assessment results when selecting common controls (typically a Tier 1 and Tier 2 activity). Risk is introduced if the implementation of a common control results in a single point of failure because the control provides a security capability potentially inherited by multiple information systems. As risk assessments are updated and refined, organizations use the results to modify current security control selections based on the most recent threat and vulnerability information available.\n\n### RMF Step 3 \u2013 Implement\n\nOrganizations can use risk assessment results to identify alternative implementations of selected security controls (e.g., considering vulnerabilities inherent in one security control implementation versus another). Some information technology products, system components, or architectural configurations may be more susceptible to certain types of threat sources; these susceptibilities are subsequently addressed during security control development and implementation. In addition, the strength of security mechanisms selected for implementation can take into consideration the threat data from risk assessments.

In addition, the strength of security mechanisms selected for implementation can take into consideration the threat data from risk assessments. Individual configuration settings for# Information Technology\n\nProducts and system components can eliminate vulnerabilities identified during the analysis of threat events. Risk assessment results also help inform decisions regarding the cost, benefit, and risk trade-offs in using one type of technology versus another or how security controls are effectively implemented in particular operational environments (e.g., when compensating controls must be used due to the unavailability of certain technologies). As risk assessments are updated and refined, organizations use the results to help determine if current security control implementations remain effective given changes to the threat space.\n\n## RMF Step 4 \u2013 Assess\n\nOrganizations can use the results from security control assessments to inform risk assessments. Security control assessments (documented in security assessment reports) identify vulnerabilities in organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate. Partial or complete failure of deployed security controls or the absence of planned controls represents potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threat sources. Organizations use the results from risk assessments to help determine the severity of such vulnerabilities which in turn, can guide and inform organizational risk responses (e.g., prioritizing risk response activities, establishing milestones for corrective actions).\n\n## RMF Step 5 \u2013 Authorize\n\nOrganizations can use risk assessment results to provide risk-related information to authorizing officials. The risk responses carried out by organizations based on the risk assessments result in a known security posture of organizational information systems and environments of operation. Risk assessment results provide essential information to enable authorizing officials to make risk-based decisions on whether to operate those systems in the current security posture or take actions to provide additional security controls, thereby further reducing risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation.\n\n## RMF Step 6 \u2013 Monitor",

Continuous monitoring processes evaluate: (i) the effectiveness of security controls; (ii) changes to information systems and environments of operation; and (iii) compliance to federal legislation, regulations, directives, policies, standards, and guidance. As risk assessments are updated and refined, organizations use the results to update the risk management strategy, thereby incorporating lessons learned into risk management processes, improving responses to risk, and building a solid foundation of threat and vulnerability information tailored to organizational missions/business functions.\n\n### 2.4.4 Risk Communications and Information Sharing\n\nThe risk assessment process entails ongoing communications and information sharing among stakeholders to ensure that: (i) the inputs to such assessments are as accurate# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n## Risk Communication and Information Sharing",

The manner and form in which risks are communicated are an expression of organizational culture as well as legal, regulatory, and contractual constraints. To be effective, communication of information security risks and other risk-related information produced during the risk assessment is consistent with other forms of risk communication within organizations. To maximize the benefit of risk assessments, organizations should establish policies, procedures, and implementing mechanisms to ensure that the information produced during such assessments is effectively communicated and shared across all three risk management tiers. To reinforce the importance of risk communication and information sharing within organizations, the input tables in Appendices D, E, F, G, H, and I (i.e., threat sources, threat events, vulnerabilities, predisposing conditions, likelihood, impact, and risk) and the recommended elements of a risk assessment report (Appendix K) provide recommendations for risk communication/sharing among the tiers.\n\n## Targeted Risk Assessments",
  "## Targeted Risk Assessments\n\nOrganizations can use targeted risk assessments, in which the scope is narrowly defined, to produce answers to specific questions (e.g., what is the risk associated with relying on a given technology, how should prior assessments of risk be revised based on incidents that have occurred, what new risks can be identified based on knowledge about a newly discovered threat or vulnerability) or to inform specific decisions (e.g., which risks should be managed at Tier 1 rather than Tier 2 or 3). Organizations may consider assessing risk at Tier 1 and Tier 2 arising from a set of common threats and vulnerabilities applicable to a wide range of organizational information systems. Assessing risk at Tiers 1 and 2 allows organizations to reduce the number of threats and vulnerabilities considered at the individual information system level and develop common risk responses for such organization-wide risks. This approach can support the common control selection process for organizations and increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of risk assessments across the organization.\n\nWith respect to all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy, there are no specific requirements with regard to: (i) the formality, rigor, or level of detail that characterizes any particular risk assessment; (ii) the methodologies, tools, and techniques used to conduct such risk assessments; or (iii) the format and content of assessment results and any associated reporting mechanisms. Organizations have maximum flexibility on how risk assessments are conducted, where such assessments are applied, and how the results will be used. Organizations are encouraged to use the guidance in a manner that most effectively and cost-effectively provides the information necessary to senior leaders/executives to facilitate informed risk management decisions.\n\n# CHAPTER THREE# THE PROCESS\n\n## CONDUCTING RISK ASSESSMENTS WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS",

The risk assessment process is composed of four steps: (i) prepare for the assessment; (ii) conduct the assessment; (iii) communicate assessment results; and (iv) maintain the assessment. Each step is divided into a set of tasks. For each task, supplemental guidance provides additional information for organizations conducting risk assessments. Risk tables and exemplary assessment scales are listed in appropriate tasks and cross-referenced to additional, more detailed information in the supporting appendices. Figure 5 illustrates the basic steps in the risk assessment process and highlights the specific tasks for conducting the assessment.\n\n### 3.1 PREPARING FOR THE RISK ASSESSMENT",
  "### 3.1 PREPARING FOR THE RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nThe first step in the risk assessment process is to prepare for the assessment. The objective of this step is to establish a context for the risk assessment. This context is established and informed by the results from the risk framing step of the risk management process. Risk framing identifies, for example, organizational information regarding policies and requirements for conducting risk assessments, specific assessment methodologies to be employed, procedures for selecting risk factors to be considered, scope of the assessments, rigor of analyses, degree of formality, and requirements that facilitate consistent and repeatable risk determinations across the organization. Organizations use the risk management strategy to the extent practicable to obtain information to prepare for the risk assessment. Preparing for a risk assessment includes the following tasks:\n\n- Identify the purpose of the assessment;\n- Identify the scope of the assessment;\n- Identify the assumptions and constraints associated with the assessment;\n- Identify the sources of information to be used as inputs to the assessment; and\n- Identify the risk model and analytic approaches (i.e., assessment and analysis approaches) to be employed during the assessment.\n\n#### STEP 1: PREPARE FOR THE ASSESSMENT\n\n##### IDENTIFY PURPOSE\n\n**TASK 1-1:** Identify the purpose of the risk assessment in terms of the information that the assessment is intended to produce and the decisions the assessment is intended to support.\n\n**Supplemental Guidance:** The purpose of the risk assessment is explicitly stated in sufficient detail to ensure that the assessment produces the appropriate information and supports the intended decisions.

Understand dependencies and ways in which risks are accepted, rejected, shared, transferred, or mitigated among information systems that support organizational mission/business processes;\n2. Support architectural and operational decisions for organizational risk responses (e.g., reducing dependencies, limiting connectivity, enhancing or focusing monitoring, and enhancing information/system resiliency);\n3. Identify trends, so that proactive risk response strategies and courses of action for mission/business processes can be defined; and\n4. Support reciprocity, particularly to enable information sharing.\n\n## Tier 1\n\nRisk assessments:\n1. Support the risk executive (function); and\n2. Serve as a key input to the risk management strategy.\n\nIn addition to these common purposes, risk assessments may have a very specific purpose, to answer a specific question (e.g., What are the risk implications of a newly discovered vulnerability or class of vulnerabilities, allowing new connectivity, outsourcing a specific function, or adopting a new technology?). Risk assessment results from all tiers can be used by organizations to inform the acquisition process by helping to ensure information security requirements are clearly specified.\n\n## Purpose of Risk Assessment\n\nThe purpose of the risk assessment is influenced by whether the assessment is:\n1.

Establishing a baseline assessment of risk; or\n2. Identifying threats and vulnerabilities, impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, and other risk factors to be tracked over time as part of risk monitoring.\n\nFor a reassessment initiated from the risk response step, the purpose can include, for example, providing a comparative analysis of alternative risk responses or answering a specific question (see discussion of targeted risk assessments above). Alternatively, for a reassessment initiated from the risk monitoring step, the purpose can include, for example, updating the risk assessment based on:\n1. Ongoing determinations of the effectiveness of security controls in organizational information systems or environments of operation;\n2. Changes to information systems or environments of operation (e.g., changes to hardware, firmware, software; changes to system-specific, hybrid, or common controls; changes to mission/business processes, common infrastructure and support services, threats, vulnerabilities, or facilities); and\n3. Results from compliance verification activities.\n\nReassessments can also be initiated by organizations due to incidents that have occurred (e.g., cyber attacks compromising organizational information or information systems).\n\n# Identify Scope\n\n## Task 1-2\n\nIdentify the scope of the risk assessment in terms of organizational applicability, time frame supported, and architectural/technology considerations.\n\n### Supplemental Guidance\n\nThe scope of the risk assessment determines what will be considered in the assessment.

Appendix K provides an example of the type of information that may be included in a risk assessment report or the preferred vehicle for risk communication.\n\n## Organizational Applicability\n\nOrganizational applicability describes which parts of the organization or suborganizations are affected by the risk assessment and the risk-based decisions resulting from the assessment (including the parts of the organization or suborganizations responsible for implementing the activities and tasks related to the decisions).\n\nFor example, the risk assessment can inform decisions regarding information systems supporting a particular organizational mission/business function or mission/business process. This can include decisions regarding the selection, tailoring, or supplementation of security controls for specific information systems or the selection of common controls. Alternatively, the risk assessment can inform decisions regarding a set of closely related missions/business functions or mission/business processes.\n\nThe scope of the risk assessment can include not only the missions/business functions, mission/business processes, common infrastructure, or shared services on which the organization currently depends, but also those which the organization might use under specific operational conditions.\n\n## Effectiveness Time Frame",

The time frame is usually related to the purpose of the assessment.\n\nFor example, a risk assessment to inform Tier 1 policy-related decisions needs to be relevant for an extended period of time since the governance process for policy changes can be time-consuming in many organizations. A risk assessment conducted to inform a Tier 3 decision on the use of a compensating security control for an information system may be relevant only until the next release of the information technology product providing the required security capability.\n\nOrganizations determine the useful life of risk assessment results and under what conditions the current assessment results become ineffective or irrelevant. Risk monitoring can be used to help determine the effectiveness of time frames for risk assessments. In addition to risk assessment results, organizations also consider the currency/timeliness (i.e., latency or age) of all types of information/data used in assessing risk. This is of particular concern in information reuse and evaluating the validity of assessment results.\n\n## Architectural/Technology Considerations\n\nOrganizations use architectural and technology considerations to clarify the scope of the risk assessment.

Descriptions of threat events can be expressed in highly general terms (e.g., phishing, distributed denial-of-service), in more descriptive terms using tactics, techniques, and procedures, or in highly specific terms (e.g., the names of specific information systems, technologies, organizations, roles, or locations). In addition, organizations consider: (i) what representative set of threat events can serve as a starting point for the identification of the specific threat events in the risk assessment; and (ii) what degree of confirmation is needed for threat events to be considered relevant for purposes of the risk assessment. For example, organizations may consider only those threat events that have been observed (either internally or by organizations that are peers/partners) or all possible threat events. Table E-2 and Table E-3 provide representative examples of adversarial and non-adversarial threat events at a level of detail that can be used for risk assessments at all tiers. Greater detail can be found in multiple sources (e.g., Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification [CAPEC]).

If such information is identified during the risk framing step and included as part of the organizational risk management strategy, the information need not be repeated in each individual risk assessment. Vulnerabilities can be associated with organizational information systems (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, internal controls, and security procedures) or the environments in which those systems operate (e.g., organizational governance, external relationships, mission/business processes, enterprise architectures, information security architectures). Organizations also determine the types of predisposing conditions that are to be considered during risk assessments including, for example, architectures and technologies employed, environments of operation, and personnel. Table F-4 provides representative examples of such predisposing conditions. Organizational assumptions about vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions to consider and level of detail, inform Task 2-3.\n\n## Likelihood\nOrganizations make explicit the process used to conduct likelihood determinations and any assumptions related to the likelihood determination process.

Risk tolerance is determined as part of the organizational risk management strategy to ensure consistency across the organization. Organizations also provide guidance on how to identify reasons for uncertainty when risk factors are assessed, since uncertainty in one or more factors will propagate to the resulting evaluation of level of risk, and how to compensate for incomplete, imperfect, or assumption-dependent estimates. Consideration of uncertainty is especially important when organizations consider advanced persistent threats (APT) since assessments of the likelihood of threat event occurrence can have a great degree of uncertainty. To compensate, organizations can take a variety of approaches to determine likelihood, ranging from assuming the worst-case likelihood (certain to happen sometime in the foreseeable future) to assuming that if an event has not been observed, it is unlikely to happen. Organizations also determine what levels of risk (combination of likelihood and impact) indicate that no further analysis of any risk factors is needed.\n\n## Analytic Approach",

Organizations also determine what levels of risk (combination of likelihood and impact) indicate that no further analysis of any risk factors is needed.\n\n## Analytic Approach\n\nRisk assessments include both assessment approaches (i.e., quantitative, qualitative, semi-quantitative) and analysis approaches (i.e., threat-oriented, asset/impact-oriented, vulnerability-oriented). Together, the assessment and analysis approaches form the analytic approach for the risk assessment. Organizations determine the level of detail and in what form threats are analyzed including the level of granularity to describe threat events or threat scenarios. Different analysis approaches can lead to different levels of detail in characterizing adverse events for which likelihoods are determined. For example, an adverse event could be characterized in several ways (with increasing levels of detail): (i) a threat event (for which the likelihood is determined by taking the maximum overall threat sources); (ii) a pairing of a threat event and a threat source; or (iii) a detailed threat scenario/attack tree. In general, organizations can be expected to require more detail for highly critical missions/business functions, common infrastructures, or shared services on which multiple missions or business functions depend (as common points of failure), and information systems with high criticality or sensitivity. Mission/business owners may amplify this guidance for risk hot spots (information systems, services, or critical infrastructure components of particular concern) in mission/business segments.\n\n## Identify Information Sources\n\n### Task 1-4: Identify the sources of descriptive, threat, vulnerability, and impact information to be used in the# Risk Assessment\n\n## Supplemental Guidance\n\nDescriptive information enables organizations to be able to determine the relevance of threat and vulnerability information.",

Organizations typically define (or select and tailor from the appendices) the assessment scales to be used in their risk assessments, annotating with organizationally-meaningful examples for specific values and defining break points between bins for semi-quantitative approaches. In addition, mission/business owners can provide further annotations with mission/business-specific examples. Organizations can identify different assessment scales to be used in different circumstances.

  "## IDENTIFY VULNERABILITIES AND PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS\n\n### TASK 2-3: Identify vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions that affect the likelihood that threat events of concern result in adverse impacts.\n\nSupplemental Guidance: The primary purpose of vulnerability assessments is to understand the nature and degree to which organizations, mission/business processes, and information systems are vulnerable to threat sources identified in Task 2-1 and the threat events identified in Task 2-2 that can be initiated by those threat sources. Vulnerabilities at Tier 1 can be pervasive across organizations and can have wide-ranging adverse impacts if exploited by threat events. For example, organizational failure to consider supply chain activities can result in organizations acquiring subverted components that adversaries could exploit to disrupt organizational missions/business functions or to obtain sensitive organizational information. Vulnerabilities at Tier 2 can be described in terms of organizational mission/business processes, enterprise architecture, the use of multiple information systems, or common infrastructures/shared services. At Tier 2, vulnerabilities typically cross or span information system boundaries. Vulnerabilities at Tier 3 can be described in terms of the information technologies employed within organizational information systems, the environments in which those systems operate, and/or the lack of or weaknesses in system-specific security controls. There is potentially a many-to-many relationship between threat events and vulnerabilities. Multiple threat events can exploit a single vulnerability, and conversely, multiple vulnerabilities can be exploited by a single threat event.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Severity of a Vulnerability\n\nThe severity of a vulnerability is an assessment of the relative importance of mitigating such a vulnerability. Initially, the extent to which mitigation is unplanned can serve as a surrogate for vulnerability severity. Once the risks associated with a particular vulnerability have been assessed, the impact severity and exposure of the vulnerability given the security controls implemented and other vulnerabilities can be taken into consideration in assessing vulnerability severity. Assessments of vulnerability severity support risk response.\n\nVulnerabilities can be identified at varying degrees of granularity and specificity. The level of detail provided in any particular vulnerability assessment is consistent with the purpose of the risk assessment and the type of inputs needed to support follow-on likelihood and impact determinations.",

The level of detail provided in any particular vulnerability assessment is consistent with the purpose of the risk assessment and the type of inputs needed to support follow-on likelihood and impact determinations.\n\nDue to the ever-increasing size and complexity of organizations, mission/business processes, and the information systems supporting those processes, the number of vulnerabilities tends to be large and can increase the overall complexity of the analysis. Therefore, organizations have the option of using the vulnerability identification task to understand the general nature of the vulnerabilities (including scope, number, and type) relevant to the assessment (see Task 1-3) and performing a cataloging of specific vulnerabilities as necessary to do so. Organizations determine which vulnerabilities are relevant to which threat events in order to reduce the space of potential risks to be assessed.\n\nIn addition to identifying vulnerabilities, organizations also identify any predisposing conditions which may affect susceptibility to certain vulnerabilities. Predisposing conditions that exist within organizations (including mission/business processes, information systems, and environments of operation) can contribute to (i.e., increase or decrease) the likelihood that one or more threat events, once initiated by threat sources, result in adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Organizations determine which predisposing conditions are relevant to which threat events in order to reduce the space of potential risks to be assessed. Organizations assess the pervasiveness of predisposing conditions to support determination of the tier(s) at which risk response could be most effective.\n\n## Appendix F\n\nAppendix F provides a set of exemplary tables for use in identifying vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions:",

In general, the risk level is typically not higher than the impact level, and likelihood can serve to reduce risk below that impact level. However, when addressing organization-wide risk management issues with a large number of missions/business functions, mission/business processes, and supporting information systems, impact as an upper bound on risk may not hold. For example, when multiple risks materialize, even if each risk is at the moderate level, the set of those moderate-level risks could aggregate to a higher level of risk for organizations. To address situations where harm occurs multiple times, organizations can define a threat event as multiple occurrences of harm and an impact level associated with the cumulative degree of harm.\n\nDuring the execution of Tasks 2-1 through 2-5, organizations capture key information related to uncertainties in risk assessments. These uncertainties arise from sources such as missing information, subjective determinations, and assumptions made.

Such risk communications can be formal or informal with the content and format determined by organizations initiating and conducting the assessments. Organizations provide guidance on specific risk communication and reporting requirements, included as part of preparing for the risk assessment (if not provided in the risk management strategy as part of the risk framing task). Organizations prioritize risks at the same level or with similar scores (see Appendix J). Appendix K provides an example of the type of information that may be included in a risk assessment report or the preferred vehicle for risk communication.\n\n#### SHARE RISK-RELATED INFORMATION\n\n**TASK 3-2:** Share risk-related information produced during the risk assessment with appropriate organizational personnel.\n\n**Supplemental Guidance:** Organizations share source information and intermediate results and provide guidance on sharing risk-related information.

The objective of this step is to keep current, the specific knowledge of the risk organizations incur. The results of risk assessments inform risk management decisions and guide risk responses. To support the ongoing review of risk management decisions (e.g., acquisition decisions, authorization decisions for information systems and common controls, connection decisions), organizations maintain risk assessments to incorporate any changes detected through risk monitoring. Risk monitoring provides organizations with the means to, on an ongoing basis: (i) determine the effectiveness of risk responses; (ii) identify risk-impacting changes to organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate; and (iii) verify compliance. Maintaining risk assessments includes the following specific tasks:\n\n- Monitor risk factors identified in risk assessments on an ongoing basis and...# Understanding Subsequent Changes to Risk Factors\n\n- Update the components of risk assessments reflecting the monitoring activities carried out by organizations.\n\n## STEP 4: MAINTAIN THE ASSESSMENT\n\n### MONITOR RISK FACTORS\n\n#### TASK 4-1: Conduct ongoing monitoring of the risk factors that contribute to changes in risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation.",

Monitoring risk factors (e.g., threat sources and threat events, vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions, capabilities and intent of adversaries, targeting of organizational operations, assets, or individuals) can provide critical information on changing conditions that could potentially affect the ability of organizations to conduct core missions and business functions. Information derived from the ongoing monitoring of risk factors can be used to refresh risk assessments at whatever frequency deemed appropriate. Organizations can also attempt to capture changes in the effectiveness of risk response measures in order to maintain the currency of risk assessments. The objective is to maintain an ongoing situational awareness of the organizational governance structures and activities, mission/business processes, information systems, and environments of operation, and thereby all of the risk factors that may affect the risk being incurred by organizations.",

For example, it is expected to be quite common for the security posture of information systems (that is, the risk factors measured within those systems) to reflect only a part of the organizational risk response, with response actions at the organization level or mission/business process level providing a significant portion of that response. In such situations, monitoring only the security posture of information systems would likely not provide sufficient information to determine the overall risk being incurred by organizations. Highly capable, well-resourced, and purpose-driven threat sources can be expected to defeat commonly available protection mechanisms (e.g., by bypassing or tampering with such mechanisms). Thus, process-level risk response measures such as reengineering mission/business processes, wise use of information technology, or the use of alternate execution processes, in the event of compromised information systems, can be major elements of organizational risk response plans.\n\n### UPDATE RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n#### TASK 4-2: Update existing risk assessment using the results from ongoing monitoring of risk factors.",
