  "# Abstract\n\nThe protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal systems and organizations is important to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal Government to successfully carry out its assigned missions and business operations. This publication provides federal agencies and nonfederal organizations with assessment procedures that can be used to carry out assessments of the requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-172, Enhanced Security Requirements for Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information: A Supplement to NIST Special Publication 800-171. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be tailored to the needs of organizations and assessors. Assessments can be conducted as 1) self-assessments; 2) independent, third-party assessments; or 3) government-sponsored assessments. The assessments can be conducted with varying degrees of rigor based on customer-defined depth and coverage attributes. The findings and evidence produced during the assessments can be used to facilitate risk-based decisions by organizations related to the CUI enhanced security requirements.\n\n## DEFINITION AND USAGE OF THE TERM INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\nUnless specified by legislation, regulation, or government-wide policy, the term system is used in this publication instead of information system. This change reflects a broad-based and holistic definition of systems that includes general-purpose systems, industrial control systems, cyber-physical systems, and individual devices that are part of the Internet of Things. As computing systems and information technologies are deployed ubiquitously worldwide and systems and components are increasingly connected through wired and wireless networks, the susceptibility of Controlled Unclassified Information to loss or compromise grows \u2013 as does the potential for adverse consequences resulting from such occurrences.\n\n## ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEMS\n\nThe term organizational system is used in many of the CUI enhanced security requirements in [SP 800-172] and the associated assessment procedures in this publication. In that context, an organizational system is a nonfederal system that processes, stores, or transmits CUI associated with a critical program or high value asset. Specifically, enhanced security requirements apply to the system components or services that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide security protections for those components or services as mandated by a federal agency in a contract, grant, or other agreement.\n\n# CHAPTER ONE\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n### THE NEED TO ASSESS ENHANCED SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR CUI",

Specifically, enhanced security requirements apply to the system components or services that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide security protections for those components or services as mandated by a federal agency in a contract, grant, or other agreement.\n\n# CHAPTER ONE\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n### THE NEED TO ASSESS ENHANCED SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR CUI\n\nIn 2010, Executive Order 13556 established a government-wide Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Program to standardize the way that the executive branch handles unclassified information that requires protection. The regulation that implements the CUI# Program Overview\n\nProgram is 32 CFR part 2002. Only federal information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to federal law, regulation, or government-wide policy may be designated as CUI. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-172, a supplement to NIST SP 800-171, specifies enhanced security requirements to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CUI when it is associated with a high value asset or a critical program.\n\n## 1.1 Purpose and Applicability\n\nThe purpose of this publication is to describe procedures for assessing the enhanced security requirements in [SP 800-172]. Compliance with the security requirements is addressed in CUI guidance and the CUI Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or as supplemented by federal agencies (e.g., Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation). Organizations can use the assessment procedures to generate evidence to support the assertion that the enhanced security requirements have been satisfied. The assessment procedures are typically used as part of an assessment process. An assessment process is an information-gathering and evidence-producing activity to determine the effectiveness of the safeguards implemented to meet the set of security requirements specified in [SP 800-172].

An assessment process is an information-gathering and evidence-producing activity to determine the effectiveness of the safeguards implemented to meet the set of security requirements specified in [SP 800-172]. The information gathered and evidence produced can be used by an organization to:\n\n- Identify problems or shortfalls in the organization's security and risk management programs,\n- Identify security weaknesses and deficiencies in organizational systems and the environments in which those systems operate,\n- Prioritize risk mitigation decisions and activities,\n- Confirm that identified security weaknesses and deficiencies in organizational systems and environments of operation have been addressed,\n- Support continuous monitoring activities, and\n- Provide information security situational awareness.\n\nThe assessment procedures in this publication offer the flexibility to customize assessments based on organizational policies and requirements, known threat and vulnerability information, system and platform dependencies, operational considerations, and tolerance for risk.\n\n## The Scope of Enhanced Security Requirement Assessments\n\nThe scope of the assessments conducted using the procedures described in this publication is guided and informed by the system security plans for the organizational systems processing, storing, or transmitting CUI. The assessments focus on the overall effectiveness of the security safeguards intended to satisfy the enhanced security requirements defined in [SP 800-172].\n\n## 1.2 Target Audience\n\nThis publication serves system, information security, and privacy professionals, including individuals with:\n\n- System development responsibilities (e.g., program managers, system developers, system owners, systems integrators, system security engineers);\n- Information security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., system evaluators, assessors, independent verifiers/validators, auditors, analysts, system owners);# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n## Information Security, Privacy, Risk Management, Governance, and Oversight Responsibilities",

The process to assess the CUI enhanced security requirements includes preparing for assessment, developing assessment plans, conducting assessments, and analyzing results. The assessment procedures in Chapter Three are grouped by family designations to help ensure the completeness and consistency of assessments.\n\n#### 2.1 Assessment Procedures\n\nAn assessment procedure consists of an assessment objective and a set of potential assessment methods and objects that can be used to conduct the assessment. Each assessment objective includes a set of determination statements related to the CUI enhanced security requirement that is the subject of the assessment. Organization-defined parameters (ODP) that are part of selected enhanced security requirements are included in the initial determination statements for the assessment procedure. ODPs are included since the specified parameter values are used in subsequent determination statements. ODPs are numbered sequentially and noted in bold italics.\n\nDetermination statements reflect the content of the enhanced security requirements to ensure traceability of the assessment results to the requirements. The application of an assessment procedure to an enhanced security requirement produces assessment findings. The findings are used to determine if the enhanced security requirement has been satisfied. Assessment objects are associated with the specific items being assessed. These objects can include...# Specifications, Mechanisms, Activities, and Individuals\n\nSpecifications are the document-based artifacts (e.g., security policies, procedures, plans, requirements, functional specifications, architectural designs) associated with a system. Mechanisms are the specific hardware, software, or firmware safeguards employed within a system. Activities are the protection-related actions supporting a system that involve people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, exercising a contingency plan, and monitoring network traffic). Individuals are people who apply the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.\n\n## Assessment Methods\n\nAssessment methods define the nature and extent of the assessor's actions. The methods include examine, interview, and test.",

Individuals are people who apply the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.\n\n## Assessment Methods\n\nAssessment methods define the nature and extent of the assessor's actions. The methods include examine, interview, and test.\n\n- The **examine** method is the process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing assessment objects (i.e., mechanisms, activities, specifications).\n- The **interview** method is the process of holding discussions with individuals or groups of individuals to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence.\n- The **test** method is the process of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities, mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior.\n\nThe purpose of the assessment methods is to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, and obtain evidence. The results obtained from applying the methods are used for making the specific determinations called for in the determination statements and thereby achieving the objectives for the assessment procedure.\n\n## Attributes of Assessment Methods\n\nThe assessment methods described above have associated attributes of depth and coverage, which affect the level of effort for the assessment. These attributes provide a means to define the rigor and scope of the assessment to obtain the assurance needed for enhanced security requirements. A description of assessment methods and objects is provided in Appendix C.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates an example of an assessment procedure for the CUI enhanced security requirement 3.1.3e from [SP 800-172].\n\nOrganizations are not expected to use all of the assessment methods and objects contained within the assessment procedures identified in this publication. Rather, organizations have the flexibility to establish the level of effort needed and the assurance required for an assessment (e.g., which assessment methods and objects are deemed to be the most useful in obtaining the desired results). The decision on level of effort is made based on how the organization can accomplish the assessment objectives in the most cost-effective and efficient manner and with sufficient confidence to support the determination that the CUI enhanced security requirements have been satisfied.\n\n# Organization-Defined Parameters",

Assignment operations require organizations to define specific parameter values. Determination statements for organization-defined parameters (ODP) are listed first in the assessment objective section followed by the list of determination statements for the assessment objective. Determination statements for ODPs are noted in **bold italics**. The ODP values are used in the appropriate determination statements in the assessment procedure, also noted in **bold italics**.\n\n## 2.2 Assurance Cases\nBuilding an effective assurance case for determining compliance to the enhanced security requirements is a process that involves compiling evidence from a variety of sources and conducting different types of assessment activities. An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into an argument demonstrating that some claim about a system is true. For the assessments conducted using the procedures in this publication, that claim is compliance with the enhanced security requirements specified in [SP 800-172]. Assessors obtain evidence during the assessment process to allow designated officials to make objective determinations about compliance to the CUI enhanced security requirements. The evidence needed to make such determinations can be obtained from various sources, including self-assessments, independent third-party assessments, government-sponsored assessments, or other types of assessments, depending on the needs of the organization establishing the requirements and the organization conducting the assessments.",

Product assessments are typically conducted by independent, third-party testing organizations. These assessments examine the security functions of the products and the established configuration settings. Assessments can also be conducted to demonstrate compliance to industry, national, or international security standards, as well as developer and vendor claims. Since many information technology products are assessed by commercial testing organizations and then subsequently deployed in hundreds of thousands of systems, these assessments can be carried out at a greater level of depth and provide deeper insights into the security capabilities of the products.\n\nUltimately, the evidence needed to determine compliance comes from the implementation of the safeguards to satisfy the enhanced security requirements and from the assessments of that implementation. Assessors can build on previously developed artifacts that started with the specification of the organization's information security needs and is further developed during the design, development, and implementation of the system and system components.# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT",

Assessments can be conducted by system developers, system integrators, system owners, evaluators, auditors, or the security staff of organizations. The assessors or assessment teams begin by obtaining and reviewing the results from individual component product or compliance assessments. The assessors then determine the additional system-level assessments required to achieve the needed assurance using the procedures and methods contained in this publication and based on the specific implementation information provided by nonfederal organizations in their system security plans. Assessments can be used to compile and evaluate the evidence needed by organizations to determine the effectiveness of the safeguards implemented to protect CUI, the actions needed to mitigate security-related risks, and compliance to the enhanced security requirements.\n\n## SECURITY ASSESSMENT PLANS\n\nThe system security plan is used to describe how the organization meets or plans to meet the CUI enhanced security requirements. Once the organization completes the system security plan, a security assessment plan can be developed using the appropriate assessment procedures described in Chapter Three. An assessment procedure is developed for each enhanced security requirement that is selected for the system or system component. The assessment procedures can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the organization. [SP 800-53A] provides additional information on how organizations can prepare for assessments, develop assessment plans, conduct assessments, and analyze results.\n\n## CHAPTER THREE\n\n### THE PROCEDURES",

The assessment procedures are organized into 10 families, as illustrated in Table 1. Plans for conducting enhanced security requirement assessments are built using the information provided in the assessment procedures \u2013 selecting the assessment methods and objects that meet the desired assurance requirements. Organizations also have flexibility in defining the level of rigor and detail associated with the assessment based on those assurance requirements. Appendix C provides additional information on the levels of rigor and detail for assessments.\n\nThe assessment objective for an assessment procedure is achieved by applying the designated assessment methods to the selected assessment objects and producing the evidence necessary to make the determination associated with the objective. Each determination statement produces a finding of either satisfied or other than satisfied. A finding of```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nsatisfied indicates that\n\u2013 for the security requirement addressed by the determination statement \u2013 the\nassessment information obtained (i.e., the evidence collected) demonstrates that the\nassessment objective has been met, producing a fully acceptable result.
