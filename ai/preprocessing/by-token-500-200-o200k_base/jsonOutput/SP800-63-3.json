  "# Abstract\nThese guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. The guidelines cover identity proofing and authentication of users (such as employees, contractors, or private individuals) interacting with government IT systems over open networks. They define technical requirements in each of the areas of identity proofing, registration, authenticators, management processes, authentication protocols, federation, and related assertions. This publication supersedes NIST Special Publication 800-63-2.\n\n# Executive Summary\nThis section is informative. Digital identity is the online persona of a subject, and a single definition is widely debated internationally. The term persona is apropos as a subject can represent themselves online in many ways. An individual may have a digital identity for email, and another for personal finances. A personal laptop can be someone's streaming music server yet also be a worker-bot in a distributed network of computers performing complex genome calculations. Without context, it is difficult to land on a single definition that satisfies all.\n\nDigital identity as a legal identity further complicates the definition and ability to use digital identities across a range of social and economic use cases. Digital identity is hard. Proving someone is who they say they are \u2014 especially remotely, via a digital service \u2014 is fraught with opportunities for an attacker to successfully impersonate someone. As correctly captured by Peter Steiner in The New Yorker, \"On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.\" These guidelines provide mitigations to the vulnerabilities inherent online, while recognizing and encouraging that when accessing some low-risk digital services, \"being a dog\" is just fine; while other, high-risk services need a level of confidence that the digital identity accessing the service is the legitimate proxy to the real-life subject.",

Proving someone is who they say they are \u2014 especially remotely, via a digital service \u2014 is fraught with opportunities for an attacker to successfully impersonate someone. As correctly captured by Peter Steiner in The New Yorker, \"On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.\" These guidelines provide mitigations to the vulnerabilities inherent online, while recognizing and encouraging that when accessing some low-risk digital services, \"being a dog\" is just fine; while other, high-risk services need a level of confidence that the digital identity accessing the service is the legitimate proxy to the real-life subject.\n\nFor these guidelines, digital identity is the unique representation of a subject engaged in an online transaction. A digital identity is always unique in the context of a digital service, but does not necessarily need to uniquely identify the subject in all contexts. In other words, accessing a digital service may not mean that the subject's real-life identity is known. Identity proofing establishes that a subject is who they claim to be. Digital authentication establishes that a subject attempting to access a digital service is in control of one or more valid authenticators associated with that subject's digital identity. For services in which return visits are applicable, successfully authenticating provides reasonable risk-based assurances that the subject accessing the service today is the same as that which accessed the service previously.\n\nDigital identity presents a technical challenge because this process often involves proofing.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nIndividuals over an open network, and always involves the authentication of individual subjects over an open network to access digital government services. The processes and technologies to establish and use digital identities offer multiple opportunities for impersonation and other attacks.\n\nThese technical guidelines supersede NIST Special Publication SP 800-63-2. Agencies use these guidelines as part of the risk assessment and implementation of their digital service(s). These guidelines provide mitigations of an authentication error's negative impacts by separating the individual elements of identity assurance into discrete, component parts. For non-federated systems, agencies will select two components, referred to as Identity Assurance Level (IAL) and Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). For federated systems, agencies will select a third component, Federation Assurance Level (FAL).",

For federated systems, agencies will select a third component, Federation Assurance Level (FAL).\n\nThese guidelines retire the concept of a level of assurance (LOA) as a single ordinal that drives implementation-specific requirements. Rather, by combining appropriate business and privacy risk management side-by-side with mission need, agencies will select IAL, AAL, and FAL as distinct options. While many systems will have the same numerical level for each of IAL, AAL, and FAL, this is not a requirement and agencies should not assume they will be the same in any given system.\n\n## Components of Identity Assurance\n\nThe components of identity assurance detailed in these guidelines are as follows:\n\n- **IAL** refers to the identity proofing process.\n- **AAL** refers to the authentication process.\n- **FAL** refers to the strength of an assertion in a federated environment, used to communicate authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to a relying party (RP).",

For example, these guidelines support scenarios that will allow pseudonymous interactions even when strong, multi-factor authenticators are used. In addition, these guidelines encourage minimizing the dissemination of identifying information by requiring federated identity providers (IdPs) to support a range of options for querying data, such as asserting whether an individual is older than a certain age rather than querying the entire date of birth. While many agency use cases will require individuals to be fully identified, these guidelines encourage pseudonymous access to government digital services wherever possible and, even where full identification is necessary, limiting the amount of personal information collected as much as possible.\n\nIn today's environment, an organization's identity solution need not be a monolith, where one system or vendor provides all functionality.

When used in a normative statement in these guidelines, they are CAPITALIZED for ease of identification. For example, SHALL is used to denote a mandatory requirement, while SHOULD refers to a technique, technology, or process that is recommended but not mandatory.

The three IALs reflect the options agencies may select from based on their risk profile and the potential harm caused by an attacker making a successful false claim of an identity. The IALs are as follows:\n\n- **IAL1:** There is no requirement to link the applicant to a specific real-life identity. Any attributes provided in conjunction with the authentication process are self-asserted or should be treated as such (including attributes a Credential Service Provider, or CSP, asserts to an RP).\n\n- **IAL2:** Evidence supports the real-world existence of the claimed identity and verifies that the applicant is appropriately associated with this real-world identity. IAL2 introduces the need for either remote or physically-present identity proofing. Attributes can be asserted by CSPs to RPs in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes.\n\n- **IAL3:** Physical presence is required for identity proofing. Identifying attributes must be verified by an authorized and trained representative of the CSP. As with IAL2, attributes can be asserted by CSPs to RPs in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes.# SP 800-63B Authentication and Lifecycle Management\n\nFor services in which return visits are applicable, a successful authentication provides reasonable risk-based assurances that the subscriber accessing the service today is the same as that which accessed the service previously. The robustness of this confidence is described by an AAL categorization. NIST SP 800-63B addresses how an individual can securely authenticate to a CSP to access a digital service or set of digital services.

Successful authentication requires that the claimant prove possession and control of the authenticator through a secure authentication protocol.\n\n## AAL2\n\nAAL2 provides high confidence that the claimant controls authenticator(s) bound to the subscriber's account. Proof of possession and control of two distinct authentication factors is required through secure authentication protocol(s). Approved cryptographic techniques are required at AAL2 and above.\n\n## AAL3\n\nAAL3 provides very high confidence that the claimant controls authenticator(s) bound to the subscriber's account. Authentication at AAL3 is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. AAL3 authentication SHALL use a hardware-based authenticator and an authenticator that provides verifier impersonation resistance; the same device MAY fulfill both these requirements. In order to authenticate at AAL3, claimants SHALL prove possession and control of two distinct authentication factors through secure authentication protocol(s). Approved cryptographic techniques are required.\n\n# SP 800-63C Federation and Assertions\n\nNIST SP 800-63C provides requirements when using federated identity architectures and assertions to convey the results of authentication processes and relevant identity information to an agency application. In addition, this volume offers privacy-enhancing techniques to share information about a valid, authenticated subject and describes methods that allow for strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) while the subject remains pseudonymous to the digital service.

The assertion is```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## signed by the IdP using approved cryptography.\n\n### FAL2:\nAdds the requirement that the assertion be encrypted using approved cryptography such that the RP is the only party that can decrypt it.\n\n### FAL3:\nRequires the subscriber to present proof of possession of a cryptographic key referenced in the assertion in addition to the assertion artifact itself. The assertion is signed by the IdP and encrypted to the RP using approved cryptography.\n\nThese guidelines are agnostic to the vast array of identity service architectures that agencies can develop or acquire, and are meant to be applicable regardless of the approach an agency selects. However, agencies are encouraged to use federation where possible, and the ability to mix and match IAL, AAL, and FAL is simplified when federated architectures are used.

Digital identity is the unique representation of a subject engaged in an online transaction. A digital identity is always unique in the context of a digital service, but does not necessarily need to uniquely identify the subject in all contexts. In other words, accessing a digital service may not mean that the subject's real-life identity is known. Identity proofing establishes that a subject is who they claim to be. Digital authentication is the process of determining the validity of one or more authenticators used to claim a digital identity. Authentication establishes that a subject attempting to access a digital service is in control of the technologies used to authenticate. Successful authentication provides reasonable risk-based assurances that the subject accessing the service today is the same as that which previously accessed the service. Digital identity presents a technical challenge because this process often involves proofing individuals over an open network, and typically involves the authentication of individual subjects over an open network to access digital government services. There are multiple opportunities for impersonation and other attacks that fraudulently claim another subject's digital identity. This recommendation provides agencies with technical guidelines for digital authentication of subjects to federal systems over a network. This recommendation also provides guidelines for credential service providers (CSPs), verifiers, and relying parties (RPs). These guidelines describe the risk management processes for selecting appropriate digital identity services and the details for implementing identity assurance, authenticator assurance.\n```# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT",
  "and federation assurance levels based on risk. Risk assessment guidance in these guidelines supplements the NIST Risk Management Framework [NIST RMF] and its component special publications. This guideline does not establish additional risk management processes for agencies. Rather, requirements contained herein provide specific guidance related to digital identity risk while executing all relevant RMF lifecycle phases.\n\nDigital authentication supports privacy protection by mitigating risks of unauthorized access to individuals' information. At the same time, because identity proofing, authentication, authorization, and federation involve the processing of individuals' information, these functions can also create privacy risks. These guidelines therefore include privacy requirements and considerations to help mitigate potential associated privacy risks.\n\nThese guidelines support the mitigation of the negative impacts induced by an authentication error by separating the individual elements of identity assurance into discrete, component parts. For non-federated systems, agencies will select two components, referred to as Identity Assurance Level (IAL) and Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). For federated systems, a third component, Federation Assurance Level (FAL), is included. Section 5, Digital Identity Risk Management provides details on the risk assessment process. Section 6, Selecting Assurance Levels combines the results of the risk assessment with additional context to support agency selection of the appropriate IAL, AAL, and FAL combinations based on risk.\n\nThese guidelines do not consider nor result in a composite level of assurance (LOA) in the context of a single ordinal that drives implementation-specific requirements. Rather, by combining appropriate risk management for business, security, and privacy side-by-side with mission need, agencies will select IAL, AAL, and FAL as distinct options. Specifically, this document does not recognize the four LOA model previously used by federal agencies and described in OMB M-04-04, instead requiring agencies to individually select levels corresponding to each function being performed. While many systems will have the same numerical level for each IAL, AAL, and FAL, this is not a requirement, and agencies should not assume they will be the same in any given system or application.\n\n## The components of identity assurance detailed in these guidelines are as follows:\n\n- **IAL** refers to the identity proofing process.\n- **AAL** refers to the authentication process.\n- **FAL** refers to the assertion protocol used in a federated environment to communicate authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to an RP.",

To minimize the risk of compatibility errors, a reference to the base document (i.e., SP 800-63 rather than SP 800-63-3) always refers to the current version of the document.\n\n## The following table states which sections of this volume are normative and which are informative:\n\n### 2.1 Applicability\nNot all digital services require authentication or identity proofing; however, this guidance applies to all such transactions for which digital identity or authentication are required, regardless of the constituency (e.g. citizens, business partners, government entities). Transactions not covered by this guidance include those associated with national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3542(b)(2). Private sector organizations and state, local, and tribal governments whose digital processes require varying levels of assurance may consider the use of these standards where appropriate.\n\nThese guidelines primarily focus on agency services that interact with the non-federal workforce, such as citizens accessing benefits or private sector partners accessing information sharing collaboration spaces.

FISMA directs federal agencies to develop, document, and implement agency-wide programs to provide security for the information and systems that support the agency's operations and assets. This includes the security authorization and accreditation (SA&A) of IT systems that support digital authentication. NIST recommends that non-federal entities implementing these guidelines follow equivalent standards to ensure the secure operations of their digital systems.\n\n## 2.3 A Few Limitations\n\nThese technical guidelines do not address the authentication of subjects for physical access (e.g., to buildings), though some authenticators used for digital access may also be used for physical access authentication.

Also excluded are specific requirements for issuing authenticators to devices when they are used in authentication protocols with people.\n\n## 2.4 How to Use this Suite of SPs\n\nThe business model, marketplace, and composition of how identity services are delivered has drastically changed since the first version of SP 800-63 was released. Notably, CSPs can be componentized and comprised of multiple independently-operated and owned business entities. Furthermore, there may be a significant security benefit to using strong authenticators even if no identity proofing is required. Therefore, in this revision, a suite of SPs under the 800-63 moniker has been created to facilitate these new models and make it easy to access the specific requirements for the function an entity may serve under the overall digital identity model.\n\n## 2.5 Change History\n\n### 2.5.1 SP 800-63-1\n\nNIST SP 800-63-1 updated NIST SP 800-63 to reflect current authenticator (then referred to as \"token\") technologies and restructured it to provide a better understanding of the digital identity architectural model used here. Additional (minimum) technical requirements were specified for the CSP, protocols used to transport authentication information, and assertions if implemented within the digital identity model.\n\n### 2.5.2 SP 800-63-2\n\nNIST SP 800-63-2 was a limited update of SP 800-63-1 and substantive changes were made only in Section 5, Registration and Issuance Processes. The substantive changes in the revised draft were intended to facilitate the use of professional credentials in the identity proofing process, and to reduce the need to send postal mail to an address of record to issue credentials for level 3 remote registration. Other changes to Section 5 were minor explanations and clarifications.",

Other changes to Section 5 were minor explanations and clarifications.\n\n### 2.5.3 SP 800-63-3\n\nNIST SP 800-63-3 is a substantial update and restructuring of SP 800-63-2. SP 800-63-3 introduces individual components of digital authentication assurance \u2014 AAL, IAL, and FAL \u2014 to support the growing need for independent treatment of authentication strength and confidence in an individual's claimed identity (e.g., in strong pseudonymous authentication). A risk assessment methodology and its application to IAL, AAL, and FAL has been included in this guideline. It also moves the whole of digital identity guidance covered under SP 800-63 from a single document describing authentication to a suite of four documents (to separately address the individual components mentioned above) of which SP 800-63-3 is the top-level document.\n\nOther areas updated in 800-63-3 include:\n- Renamed to \"Digital Identity Guidelines\" to properly represent the scope includes identity proofing and federation, and to support expanding the scope to include device.# Identity and Authentication Guidelines",
  "Other areas updated in 800-63-3 include:\n- Renamed to \"Digital Identity Guidelines\" to properly represent the scope includes identity proofing and federation, and to support expanding the scope to include device.# Identity and Authentication Guidelines\n\n## Overview of Changes\n- Identity, or machine-to-machine authentication in future revisions.\n- Terminology changes, including the use of authenticator in place of token to avoid conflicting use of the word token in assertion technologies.\n- Updates to authentication and assertion requirements to reflect advances in both security technology and threats.\n- Requirements on the storage of long-term secrets by verifiers.\n- Restructured identity proofing model.\n- Updated requirements regarding remote identity proofing.\n- Clarification on the use of independent channels and devices as \"something you have\".\n- Removal of pre-registered knowledge tokens (authenticators), with the recognition that they are special cases of (often very weak) passwords.\n- Requirements regarding account recovery in the event of loss or theft of an authenticator.\n- Removal of email as a valid channel for out-of-band authenticators.\n- Expanded discussion of re-authentication and session management.\n- Expanded discussion of identity federation; restructuring of assertions in the context of federation.\n\n## Definitions and Abbreviations\nSee Appendix A for a complete set of definitions and abbreviations.\n\n## Digital Identity Model\nThis section is informative.\n\n### Overview\nThe digital identity model used in these guidelines reflects technologies and architectures currently available in the market. More complex models that separate functions \u2014 such as issuing credentials and providing attributes \u2014 among a larger number of parties are also available and may have advantages in some application classes. While a simpler model is used in this document, it does not preclude agencies from separating these functions.\n\nAdditionally, certain enrollment, identity proofing, and issuance processes performed by the CSP are sometimes delegated to an entity known as either the registration authority (RA) or identity manager (IM). A close relationship between the RA and CSP is typical, and the nature of this relationship may differ among RAs, IMs, and CSPs. The type of relationship and its requirements is outside of the scope of this document. Accordingly, the term CSP will be inclusive of RA and IM functions. Finally, a CSP may provide other services in addition to digital identity services. In these situations, the requirements specified throughout these guidelines only apply to the CSP function(s), not the additional services.",

Finally, a CSP may provide other services in addition to digital identity services. In these situations, the requirements specified throughout these guidelines only apply to the CSP function(s), not the additional services.\n\nDigital identity is the unique representation of a subject engaged in an online transaction. The process used to verify a subject's association with their real-world identity is called identity proofing. In these guidelines, the party to be proofed is called an applicant. When the applicant successfully completes the proofing process, they are referred to as a subscriber.\n\nThe strength of identity proofing is described by an ordinal measurement called the IAL. At IAL1, identity proofing is not required, therefore any attribute information provided by the# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nThe applicant is self-asserted, or should be treated as self-asserted and not verified (even if provided by a CSP to an RP). IAL2 and IAL3 require identity proofing, and the RP may request the CSP assert information about the subscriber, such as verified attribute values, verified attribute references, or pseudonymous identifiers. This information assists the RP in making authorization decisions. An RP may decide that it requires IAL2 or IAL3, but may only need specific attributes, resulting in the subject retaining some degree of pseudonymity. This privacy-enhancing approach is a benefit of separating the strength of the proofing process from that of the authentication process. An RP may also employ a federated identity approach where the RP outsources all identity proofing, attribute collection, and attribute storage to a CSP.",

This privacy-enhancing approach is a benefit of separating the strength of the proofing process from that of the authentication process. An RP may also employ a federated identity approach where the RP outsources all identity proofing, attribute collection, and attribute storage to a CSP.\n\nIn these guidelines, the party to be authenticated is called a claimant and the party verifying that identity is called a verifier. When a claimant successfully demonstrates possession and control of one or more authenticators to a verifier through an authentication protocol, the verifier can verify that the claimant is a valid subscriber. The verifier passes on an assertion about the subscriber, who may be either pseudonymous or non-pseudonymous, to the RP. That assertion includes an identifier, and may include identity information about the subscriber, such as the name, or other attributes that were collected in the enrollment process (subject to the CSP's policies, the RP's needs, and consent for disclosure of attributes given by the subject). Where the verifier is also the RP, the assertion may be implicit. The RP can use the authenticated information provided by the verifier to make authorization decisions.\n\nAuthentication establishes confidence that the claimant has possession of an authenticator(s) bound to the credential, and in some cases in the attribute values of the subscriber (e.g., if the subscriber is a U.S. citizen, is a student at a particular university, or is assigned a particular number or code by an agency or organization). Authentication does not determine the claimant's authorizations or access privileges; this is a separate decision, and is out of these guidelines' scope. RPs can use a subscriber's authenticated identity and attributes with other factors to make authorization decisions. Nothing in this document suite precludes RPs from requesting additional information from a subscriber that has successfully authenticated.",

RPs can use a subscriber's authenticated identity and attributes with other factors to make authorization decisions. Nothing in this document suite precludes RPs from requesting additional information from a subscriber that has successfully authenticated.\n\nThe strength of the authentication process is described by an ordinal measurement called the AAL. AAL1 requires single-factor authentication and is permitted with a variety of different authenticator types. At AAL2, authentication requires two authentication factors for additional security. Authentication at the highest level, AAL3, additionally requires the use of a hardware-based authenticator and verifier impersonation resistance. The various entities and interactions that comprise the digital identity model used here are illustrated in Figure 4-1.\n\nThe left side of the diagram shows the enrollment, credential issuance, lifecycle management.# Activities and Identity Proofing Process\n\nThe usual sequence of interactions is as follows:\n\n1. An applicant applies to a CSP through an enrollment process.\n2. The CSP identity proofs that applicant. Upon successful proofing, the applicant becomes a subscriber.\n3. Authenticator(s) and a corresponding credential are established between the CSP and the subscriber.\n4. The CSP maintains the credential, its status, and the enrollment data collected for the lifetime of the credential (at a minimum). The subscriber maintains his or her authenticator(s).\n\nOther sequences are less common, but could also achieve the same functional requirements.\n\n## Digital Authentication Process\n\nThe right side of Figure 4-1 shows the entities and interactions involved in using an authenticator to perform digital authentication.

The claimant proves possession and control of the authenticator(s) to the verifier through an authentication protocol.\n2. The verifier interacts with the CSP to validate the credential that binds the subscriber's identity to their authenticator and to optionally obtain claimant attributes.\n3. The CSP or verifier provides an assertion about the subscriber to the RP, which may use the information in the assertion to make an authorization decision.\n4. An authenticated session is established between the subscriber and the RP.\n\nIn all cases, the RP should request the attributes it requires from a CSP before authenticating the claimant. In addition, the claimant should be requested to consent to the release of those attributes prior to generation and release of an assertion.\n\n## Communication with CSP\n\nIn some cases, the verifier does not need to communicate in real time with the CSP to complete the authentication activity (e.g., some uses of digital certificates). Therefore, the dashed line between the verifier and the CSP represents a logical link between the two entities. In some implementations, the verifier, RP, and CSP functions may be distributed and separated as shown in Figure 4-1. However, if these functions reside on the same platform, the interactions between the components are local messages between applications running on the same system rather than protocols over shared, untrusted networks.\n\n## Credential Maintenance",

However, if these functions reside on the same platform, the interactions between the components are local messages between applications running on the same system rather than protocols over shared, untrusted networks.\n\n## Credential Maintenance\n\nAs noted above, a CSP maintains status information about the credentials it issues. CSPs will generally assign a finite lifetime when issuing credentials to limit the maintenance period. When the status changes, or when the credentials near expiration, credentials may be renewed or re-issued; or, the credential may be revoked and destroyed.\n\nTypically, the subscriber authenticates to the CSP using their existing, unexpired authenticator and credential in order to request issuance of a new authenticator and credential. If the subscriber fails to request authenticator and credential re-issuance prior to their expiration or revocation, they may be required to repeat the enrollment process to obtain a new authenticator and credential.

This section provides additional details regarding the participants' relationships and responsibilities in enrollment and identity proofing.\n\nAn individual, referred to as an applicant at this stage, opts to be identity proofed by a CSP. If the applicant is successfully proofed, the individual is then termed a subscriber of that CSP. The CSP establishes a mechanism to uniquely identify each subscriber, register the subscriber's credentials, and track the authenticators issued to that subscriber. The subscriber may be given authenticators at the time of enrollment, the CSP may bind authenticators the subscriber already has, or they may be generated later as needed. Subscribers have a duty to maintain control of their authenticators and comply with CSP policies in order to maintain active authenticators. The CSP maintains enrollment records for each subscriber to allow recovery of authenticators, for example, when they are lost or stolen.\n\n## 4.3 Authentication and Lifecycle Management\n\nNormative requirements can be found in SP 800-63B, Authentication and Lifecycle Management.\n\n### 4.3.1 Authenticators\n\nThe classic paradigm for authentication systems identifies three factors as the cornerstones of authentication:\n\n- Something you know (e.g., a password).\n- Something you have (e.g., an ID badge or a cryptographic key).\n- Something you are (e.g., a fingerprint or other biometric data).",

The strength of authentication systems is largely determined by the number of factors incorporated by the system \u2014 the more factors employed, the more robust the authentication system. For the purposes of these guidelines, using two factors is adequate to meet the highest security requirements. As discussed in Section 5.1, other types of information, such as location data or device identity, may be used by an RP or verifier to evaluate the risk in a claimed identity, but they are not considered authentication factors.\n\nIn digital authentication, the claimant possesses and controls one or more authenticators that have been registered with the CSP and are used to prove the claimant's identity. The authenticator(s) contain secrets the claimant can use to prove that he or she is a valid subscriber; the claimant authenticates to a system or application over a network by proving that he or she has possession and control of one or more authenticators.\n\nThe secrets contained in authenticators are based on either public key pairs (asymmetric keys) or shared secrets (symmetric keys). A public key and a related private key comprise a public key pair. The private key is stored on the authenticator and is used by the claimant to prove.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\npossession and control of the authenticator.

A verifier, knowing the claimant's public key through some credential (typically a public key certificate), can use an authentication protocol to verify the claimant's identity by proving that the claimant has possession and control of the associated private key authenticator.\n\nShared secrets stored on authenticators may be either symmetric keys or memorized secrets (e.g., passwords and PINs), as opposed to the asymmetric keys described above, which subscribers need not share with the verifier. While both keys and passwords can be used in similar protocols, one important difference between the two is how they relate to the subscriber. While symmetric keys are generally stored in hardware or software that the subscriber controls, passwords are intended to be memorized by the subscriber. Since most users choose short passwords to facilitate memorization and ease of entry, passwords typically have fewer characters than cryptographic keys. Furthermore, whereas systems choose keys at random, users attempting to choose memorable passwords will often select from a very small subset of the possible passwords of a given length, and many will choose very similar values. As such, whereas cryptographic keys are typically long enough to make network-based guessing attacks untenable, user-chosen passwords may be vulnerable, especially if no defenses are in place.\n\nIn this volume, authenticators always contain a secret. Some of the classic authentication factors do not apply directly to digital authentication. For example, a physical driver's license is something you have, and may be useful when authenticating to a human (e.g., a security guard), but is not in itself an authenticator for digital authentication. Authentication factors classified as something you know are not necessarily secrets, either. Knowledge-based authentication, where the claimant is prompted to answer questions that are presumably known only by the claimant, also does not constitute an acceptable secret for digital authentication. A biometric also does not constitute a secret. Accordingly, these guidelines only allow the use of biometrics for authentication when strongly bound to a physical authenticator.\n\nA digital authentication system may incorporate multiple factors in one of two ways:",

A biometric also does not constitute a secret. Accordingly, these guidelines only allow the use of biometrics for authentication when strongly bound to a physical authenticator.\n\nA digital authentication system may incorporate multiple factors in one of two ways:\n\n1. The system may be implemented so that multiple factors are presented to the verifier; or\n2. Some factors may be used to protect a secret that will be presented to the verifier.\n\nFor example, item 1 can be satisfied by pairing a memorized secret (what you know) with an out-of-band device (what you have). Both authenticator outputs are presented to the verifier to authenticate the claimant. For item 2, consider a piece of hardware (the authenticator) that contains a cryptographic key (the authenticator secret) where access is protected with a fingerprint. When used with the biometric, the cryptographic key produces an output that is used to authenticate the claimant.\n\nAs noted above, biometrics, when employed as a single factor of authentication,# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## do not constitute\nacceptable secrets for digital authentication \u2014 but they do have their place in\nthe authentication\nof digital identities. Biometric characteristics are unique personal attributes\nthat can be used to\nverify the identity of a person who is physically present at the point of\nverification.

A credential is stored and\nmaintained by the CSP,\nthough the claimant may possess it. The claimant possesses an authenticator, but\nis not\nnecessarily in possession of the credential. For example, database entries\ncontaining the user\nattributes are considered to be credentials for the purpose of this document but\nare possessed by\nthe verifier. X.509 public key certificates are a classic example of credentials\nthe claimant can,\nand often does, possess.\n\n### 4.3.3 Authentication Process\nThe authentication process begins with the claimant demonstrating to the\nverifier possession and\ncontrol of an authenticator that is bound to the asserted identity through an\nauthentication\nprotocol. Once possession and control have been demonstrated, the verifier\nverifies that the\ncredential remains valid, usually by interacting with the CSP.",

Once possession and control have been demonstrated, the verifier\nverifies that the\ncredential remains valid, usually by interacting with the CSP.\n\nThe exact nature of the interaction between the verifier and the claimant during\nthe\nauthentication protocol is extremely important in determining the overall\nsecurity of the system.\nWell-designed protocols can protect the integrity and confidentiality of\ncommunication between\nthe claimant and the verifier both during and after the authentication, and can\nhelp limit the\ndamage that can be done by an attacker masquerading as a legitimate verifier.\nAdditionally, mechanisms located at the verifier can mitigate online guessing\nattacks against\nlower entropy secrets \u2014 like passwords and PINs \u2014 by limiting the rate at which\nan attacker can\nmake authentication attempts, or otherwise delaying incorrect attempts.\nGenerally, this is done\nby keeping track of and limiting the number of unsuccessful attempts, since the\npremise of an\nonline guessing attack is that most attempts will fail.\n\nThe verifier is a functional role, but is frequently implemented in combination\nwith the CSP, the\nRP, or both. If the verifier is a separate entity from the CSP, it is often\ndesirable to ensure that\nthe verifier does not learn the subscriber's authenticator secret in the process\nof authentication, or\nat least to ensure that the verifier does not have unrestricted access to\nsecrets stored by the CSP.\n\n## 4.4 Federation and Assertions\nNormative requirements can be found in SP 800-63C, Federation and Assertions.# Overall Guidelines\n\nOverall, SP 800-63 does not presuppose a federated identity architecture; rather, these guidelines are agnostic to the types of models that exist in the marketplace, allowing agencies to deploy a digital authentication scheme according to their own requirements.

However, identity federation is preferred over a number of siloed identity systems that each serve a single agency or RP.\n\n## Benefits of Federated Architectures\n\nFederated architectures have many significant benefits, including, but not limited to:\n\n- **Enhanced user experience.** For example, an individual can be identity proofed once and reuse the issued credential at multiple RPs.\n- **Cost reduction** to both the user (reduction in authenticators) and the agency (reduction in information technology infrastructure).\n- **Data minimization** as agencies do not need to pay for collection, storage, disposal, and compliance activities related to storing personal information.\n- **Pseudonymous attribute assertions** as agencies can request a minimized set of attributes, to include claims, to fulfill service delivery.\n- **Mission enablement** as agencies can focus on mission, rather than the business of identity management.\n\nThe following sections discuss the components of a federated identity architecture should an agency elect this type of model.\n\n### 4.4.1 Assertions\n\nUpon completion of the authentication process, the verifier generates an assertion containing the result of the authentication and provides it to the RP. The assertion is used to communicate the result of the authentication process, and optionally information about the subscriber, from the verifier to the RP. Assertions may be communicated directly to the RP, or can be forwarded through the subscriber, which has further implications for system design.\n\nAn RP trusts an assertion based on the source, the time of creation, how long the assertion is valid from time of creation, and the corresponding trust framework that governs the policies and processes of CSPs and RPs. The verifier is responsible for providing a mechanism by which the integrity of the assertion can be confirmed.",

When the verifier passes the assertion through the subscriber, the verifier must protect the integrity of the assertion in such a way that it cannot be modified. However, if the verifier and the RP communicate directly, a protected session may be used to preserve the integrity of the assertion. When sending assertions across an open network, the verifier is responsible for ensuring that any sensitive subscriber information contained in the assertion can only be extracted by an RP that it trusts to maintain the information's confidentiality.\n\n#### Examples of Assertions\n\nExamples of assertions include:\n\n- **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)** assertions are specified using a mark-up language intended for describing security assertions. They can be used by a verifier to...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## make a statement to an RP about the identity of a claimant.\nSAML assertions may optionally be digitally signed.\n\n- OpenID Connect claims are specified using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for describing security, and optionally, user claims.

RPs may use a subscriber's authenticated identity (pseudonymous or non-pseudonymous), the IAL, AAL, and FAL (FAL indicating the strength of the assertion protocol), and other factors to make authorization decisions. The verifier and the RP may be the same entity, or they may be separate entities. If they are separate entities, the RP normally receives an assertion from the verifier. The RP ensures that the assertion came from a verifier trusted by the RP. The RP also processes any additional information in the assertion, such as personal attributes or expiration times. The RP is the final arbiter concerning whether a specific assertion presented by a verifier meets the RP's established criteria for system access regardless of IAL, AAL, or FAL.\n\n# 5 Digital Identity Risk Management\nThis section is normative.

This does not establish additional risk management processes for agencies. Rather, requirements contained herein provide specific guidance related to digital identity risk that agency RPs SHALL apply while executing all relevant RMF lifecycle phases.\n\n## 5.1 Overview\nIn today's digital services, combining proofing, authenticator, and federation requirements into a single bundle sometimes has unintended consequences and can put unnecessary implementation burden on the implementing organization. It is quite possible that an agency can deliver the most effective set of identity services by assessing the risk and impacts of failures for each individual component of digital authentication, rather than as a single, all-encompassing LOA. To this end, these guidelines recognize that an authentication error is not a singleton that drives all requirements.\n\nThis volume details requirements to assist agencies in avoiding:\n1. Identity proofing errors (i.e., a false applicant claiming an identity that is not rightfully theirs);\n2. Authentication errors (i.e., a false claimant using a credential that is not rightfully theirs);\n3. Federation errors (i.e., an identity assertion is compromised).\n\nFrom the perspective of an identity proofing failure, there are two dimensions.# CURRENT PAGE RAW OCR TEXT\n\n## of potential failure:\n\n1. The impact of providing a service to the wrong subject (e.g., an attacker successfully proofs as someone else).\n2. The impact of excessive identity proofing (i.e., collecting and securely storing more information about a person than is required to successfully provide the digital service).\n\nAs such, agencies SHALL assess the risk of proofing, authentication, and federation errors separately to determine the required assurance level for each transaction. Section 5.3 provides impact categories specific to digital identity to assist in the overall application of the RMF.",

The impact of excessive identity proofing (i.e., collecting and securely storing more information about a person than is required to successfully provide the digital service).\n\nAs such, agencies SHALL assess the risk of proofing, authentication, and federation errors separately to determine the required assurance level for each transaction. Section 5.3 provides impact categories specific to digital identity to assist in the overall application of the RMF.\n\nRisk assessments determine the extent to which risk must be mitigated by the identity proofing, authentication, and federation processes. These determinations drive the relevant choices of applicable technologies and mitigation strategies, rather than the desire for any given technology driving risk determinations. Once an agency has completed the overall risk assessment; selected individual assurance levels for identity proofing, authentication, and federation (if applicable); and determined the processes and technologies they will employ to meet each assurance level, agencies SHALL develop a \"Digital Identity Acceptance Statement\", in accordance with SP 800-53 IA-1 a.1. See Section 5.5 for more detail on the necessary content of the Digital Identity Acceptance Statement.\n\n## 5.2 Assurance Levels\n\nAn agency RP SHALL select, based on risk, the following individual assurance levels:\n\n- **IAL**: The robustness of the identity proofing process to confidently determine the identity of an individual. IAL is selected to mitigate potential identity proofing errors.\n- **AAL**: The robustness of the authentication process itself, and the binding between an authenticator and a specific individual's identifier. AAL is selected to mitigate potential authentication errors (i.e., a false claimant using a credential that is not rightfully theirs).\n- **FAL**: The robustness of the assertion protocol the federation uses to communicate authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to an RP. FAL is optional as not all digital systems will leverage federated identity architectures. FAL is selected to mitigate potential federation errors (an identity assertion is compromised).\n\nA summary of each of the identity, authenticator, and federation assurance levels is provided below. When described generically or bundled, these guidelines will refer to IAL, AAL, and FAL as xAL.",

Business process, policy, and technology may help reduce risk.\n\n## Categories of Harm and Impact Include:\n\n1. Inconvenience, distress, or damage to standing or reputation;\n2. Financial loss or agency liability;\n3. Harm to agency programs or public interests;\n4. Unauthorized release of sensitive information;\n5. Personal safety; and\n6. Civil or criminal violations.\n\nRequired assurance levels for digital transactions are determined by assessing the potential impact of each of the above categories using the potential impact values described in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 [FIPS 199].\n\nThe three potential impact values are:\n\n1. Low impact,\n2. Moderate impact, and\n3. High impact.\n\n### 5.3.1 Business Process vs. Online Transaction\n\nThe assurance level determination is only based on transactions that are part of a digital system. An online transaction may not be equivalent to a complete business process that requires offline processing, or online processing in a completely segmented system.",

Low impact,\n2. Moderate impact, and\n3. High impact.\n\n### 5.3.1 Business Process vs. Online Transaction\n\nThe assurance level determination is only based on transactions that are part of a digital system. An online transaction may not be equivalent to a complete business process that requires offline processing, or online processing in a completely segmented system.\n\nIn selecting the appropriate assurance levels, the agency should assess the risk associated with online transactions they are offering via the digital service, not the entire business process associated with the provided benefit or service.\n\nFor example, in an online survey, personal information may be collected, but it is never made available online to the submitter after the information is saved. In this instance, it is important for the information to be carefully protected in backend systems, but there is no reason to identity proof or even authenticate the user providing the information for the purposes of their own access to the system or its associated benefits. The online transaction is solely a submission of the data. The entire business process may require a significant amount of data validation, without ever needing to know if the correct person submitted the information. In this scenario, there is no need for any identity proofing nor authentication.\n\nAnother example where the assessed risk could differ if the agency evaluated the entire business process rather than the online transaction requirements is a digital service that accepts r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to apply for open job postings. In this use case, the digital service allows an individual to submit \u2013 or at least does not restrict an individual from submitting \u2013 a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on behalf of anyone else, and in subsequent visits to the site, access the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for various purposes.",

In this case, the requirements of [EO 13681] apply and the application.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nmust provide at least AAL2. However, the identity proofing requirements remain unclear. The entire business process of examining a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and ultimately hiring and onboarding a person requires a significant amount of identity proofing. The agency needs a high level of confidence that the job applicant is in fact the subject of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 submitted online if a decision to hire is made. Yet this level of proofing is not required to submit the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online. Identity proofing is not required to complete the digital portion of the transaction successfully. Identity proofing the submitter would create more risk than required in the online system as excess personal information would be collected when no such information is needed for the portion of the hiring process served by the digital job application portal and may reduce usability. Therefore, the most appropriate IAL selection would be 1. There is no need to identity proof the user to successfully complete the online transaction. This decision for the online portal itself is independent of a seemingly obvious identity proofing requirement for the entire business process, lest a job be offered to a fraudulent applicant.\n\n## 5.3.2 Impacts per Category\n\nThis section defines the potential impacts for each category of harm. Each assurance level, IAL, AAL, and FAL (if accepting or asserting a federated identity) SHALL be evaluated separately.\n\n**Note:** If an error in the identity system causes no measurable consequences for a category, there is no impact.",

This SHALL be a risk-based decision, made in context of the CSP, any RPs that use the CSP, mission, and the population served. The following considerations serve only as a guide to agencies when considering the impacts of requirements changes:\n\n1. If the RP is experiencing identity-related fraud, a migration may prove beneficial. If not, migration may not be an added value.\n2. New, stronger, or user-friendly authentication options are added to individual AALs the CSP could issue new authenticators or allow users to register authenticators they already have.\n3.

The risk assessment results are the primary factor in selecting the most appropriate levels. This section details how to apply the results of the risk assessment with additional factors unrelated to risk to determine the most advantageous xAL selection.\n\nFirst, compare the risk assessment impact profile to the impact profiles associated with each assurance level, as shown in Table 6-1 below. To determine the required assurance level, find the lowest level whose impact profile meets or exceeds the potential impact for every category analyzed in the risk assessment.\n\nIn analyzing risks, the agency SHALL consider all of the expected direct and indirect results of an authentication failure, including the possibility that there will be more than one failure, or harms to more than one person or organization. The definitions of potential impacts contain some relative terms, like \"serious\" or \"minor,\" whose meaning will depend on context. The agency SHOULD consider the context and the nature of the persons or entities affected to decide the relative significance of these harms. Over time, the meaning of these terms will become more definite as agencies gain practical experience with these issues. The analysis of harms to agency programs or other public interests depends strongly on the context; the agency SHOULD consider these issues with care.",

The analysis of harms to agency programs or other public interests depends strongly on the context; the agency SHOULD consider these issues with care.\n\nIt is possible that the assurance levels may differ across IAL, AAL, and FAL. For example, suppose an agency establishes a \"health tracker\" application in which users submit personal information in the form of personal health information (PHI). In line with the terms of EO 13681 requiring \"that all agencies making personal data accessible to citizens through digital applications require the use of multiple factors of authentication,\" the agency is required to implement MFA at AAL2 or AAL3.\n\nEO 13681 also requires agencies employ \"an effective identity proofing process, as appropriate\" when personal information is released. This does not mean that proofing at IAL2 or IAL3 (to match the required AAL) is necessary. In the above example, there may be no need for the agency system to know the actual identity of the user. In this case, an \"effective proofing process\" would be to not proof at all, therefore the agency would select IAL1. This allows the user of the health tracker system to be pseudonymous.\n\nDespite the user being pseudonymous, the agency should still select AAL2 or AAL3 for authentication because a malicious actor could gain access to the user's PHI by compromising the account.\n\n**Note:** An agency can accept a higher assurance level than those required in the table.\n```# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",

For example, in a federated transaction, an agency can accept an IAL3 identity if their application is assessed at IAL2. The same holds true for authenticators: stronger authenticators can be used at RPs that have lower authenticator requirements. However, RPs will have to ensure that this only occurs in federated scenarios with appropriate privacy protections by the CSP such that only attributes that have been requested by the RP and authorized by the subscriber are provided to the RP and that excessive personal information does not leak from the credential or an assertion. See the privacy considerations in SP 800-63C for more details.\n\n**Note:** The upshot of potentially having a different IAL, AAL, and FAL within a single application stems from the fact that this document no longer supports the notion of an overall LOA \u2014 the \"low watermark\" approach to determining LOA no longer applies. An application with IAL1 and AAL2 should not be considered any less secure or privacy-enhancing than an application with IAL2 and AAL2. The only difference between these applications is the amount of proofing required, which may not impact the security and privacy of each application. That said, if an agency incorrectly determines the xAL, security and privacy could very well be impacted.\n\n## 6.1 Selecting IAL",

The IAL selection does not mean the digital service provider will need to perform the proofing themselves. More information on whether an agency can federate is provided in Section 7.\n\n**Note:** Agencies should also consider their constituents' demographics when selecting the most appropriate proofing process. While not a function of IAL selection, certain proofing processes may be more appropriate for some demographics than others. Agencies will benefit as this type of analysis ensures the greatest opportunity for their constituents to be proofed successfully.\n\n## 6.2 Selecting AAL\n\nThe AAL decision tree in Figure 6-2 combines the results from the risk assessment with additional considerations related to authentication to allow agencies to select the most appropriate authentication requirements for their digital service offering.

While options exist to select varying xALs for a system, in many instances the same level will be chosen for all xALs. The ability to combine varying xALs offers significant flexibility to agencies, but not all combinations are possible due to the nature of the data collected from an individual and the authenticators to protect that data. Table 6-2 details valid combinations of IAL and AAL to ensure personal information remains protected by MFA.\n\nNote: Per Executive Order 13681 [EO 13681], the release of personal data requires protection with MFA, even if the personal data is self-asserted and not validated. When the transaction does not make personal data accessible, authentication may occur at AAL1, although providing an option for the user to choose stronger authentication is recommended. In addition, it may be possible at IAL1 to self-assert information that is not personal, in which case AAL1 is acceptable.\n\n## 7 Federation Considerations",

This guideline and its companion volumes are agnostic to the authentication and identity proofing architecture an agency selects. However, there are scenarios an agency may encounter that make identity federation potentially more efficient and effective than establishing identity services local to the agency or individual applications. The following list details scenarios where, if any apply, the agency may consider federation a viable option. This list does not take into consideration any economic benefits or weaknesses of federation vs. localized identity architectures.\n\n### Federate authenticators when:\n\n1. Potential users already have an authenticator at or above required AAL.\n2. Multiple credential form factors are required to cover all possible user communities.\n3. Agency does not have infrastructure to support authentication management (e.g., account recovery, authenticator issuance, help desk).\n4. There is a desire to allow primary authenticators to be added and upgraded over time without changing the RP's implementation.\n5. There are different environments to be supported, as federation protocols are network-based and allow for implementation on a wide variety of platforms and languages.\n6. Potential users come from multiple communities, each with its own existing identity infrastructure.\n\n### Federate attributes when:\n\n1. Pseudonymity is required, necessary, feasible, or important to stakeholders accessing the service.\n2. Access to the service only requires a partial attribute list.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n1. Access to the service only requires at least one attribute reference.\n2. The agency is not the authoritative source or issuing source for required attributes.\n3. Attributes are only required temporarily during use (such as to make an access decision), such that agency does not need to locally persist the data."
