This document is meant to provide guidance to this new enterprise network landscape from a secure operations perspective. Hence, it starts by examining the security limitations of current network access solutions to the enterprise network. It then considers security feature enhancements to traditional network appliances in the form of point security solutions, network configurations for various security functions (e.g., application/services security, cloud services access security, device or endpoint security), security frameworks that integrate these individual network configurations (e.g., zero trust network access [ZTNA]), and the evolving wide area network (WAN) infrastructure to provide a comprehensive set of security services for the modern enterprise network landscape (e.g., secure access service edge [SASE]).\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nThe enterprise network landscape has undergone tremendous changes in the last decade due to the following three drivers:\n\n- Enterprise access to multiple cloud services,\n- The geographical spread of enterprise-based (on-premises) IT resources (e.g., multiple data centers, headquarters, and branch offices), and\n- Changes to application architecture from being monolithic to a set of loosely coupled microservices.\n\nThe impacts of these drivers on the security of the enterprise network landscape include:\n\n- Disappearance of the concept of a network perimeter that can be protected and the necessity to protect each endpoint (device or service) that treats it as a perimeter\n- Increase in attack surface due to sheer multiplicity of IT resources (computing, networking, storage) and components\n- Escalation of attacks across several network boundaries leveraging the connectivity features\n\nThis document is meant to provide guidance to this new enterprise network landscape from a secure operations perspective.

Introduction\n\nThe enterprise network landscape has undergone a significant transformation in the last decade. The drivers for this transformation are (a) enterprise access to multiple cloud services, (b) the geographic spread of enterprise-owned (on-premises) IT resources (e.g., in headquarters, multiple branch offices, and data centers), and (c) changes to application architecture from being monolithic to a set of loosely coupled microservices \u2013 often with a dedicated infrastructure (called the service mesh) that provides all application services, including security. The high-level impacts of these drivers on the security of the current enterprise network landscape are (a) the disappearance of the concept of a perimeter associated with the enterprise network; (b) an increase in attack surface due to the sheer multiplicity of IT resource components associated with computing, storage, and network appliances; and (c) the escalation of attacks across several network boundaries leveraging connectivity features. Before providing guidance for secure operations in this new network landscape, this document will consider the structural and security implications of the drivers to enhance understanding of its components and data flows.\n\n### 1.1.

The IT environment now consists of:\n\n- Subscription to multiple cloud services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for computing, Software as a Service (SaaS) for applications, Platform as a Service (PaaS) for an application development platform, and other cloud services (e.g., identity as a service [IDaaS] for authentication)\n- Enterprise IT applications (on-premises) that are located at corporate headquarters and geographically distributed branch offices and data centers\n- IT applications that range from being monolithic to being made up of loosely coupled microservices, each hosted on heterogeneous platforms\n- Presence of edge computing devices, including the Internet of Things (IoT), in some environments\n\nThe above scenarios call for widespread connectivity between IT systems that now...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Defines the Current Enterprise Network Landscape\n\nConnectivity, in turn, involves:\n\n- Connectivity between IT resources (e.g., servers for computing and storage) in data centers (network fabric)\n- Connectivity between IT resources within a corporate office or branch office (e.g., Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Local Area Network - LAN, and Virtual Local Area Network - VLAN)\n- Connectivity for users to remotely access IT resources from home, travel locations, branch offices, and corporate offices using wide area networks (WANs), which use multiple networks such as the internet, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), and \u2013 in some instances \u2013 cellular networks (e.g., 4G/LTE, 5G).\n- Connectivity to cloud services provided by a cloud service provider (CSP) through a virtual private network (VPN) or subscription to WAN services (premises-based equipment licenses or cloud-based)\n\n## 1.2.

  "## 1.2. Security Implications of Drivers on the Enterprise Network Landscape\n\nNow consider the immediate security implications of these drivers on the enterprise network landscape.\n\n### Subscription to Multiple Cloud Services\n\nAccessing cloud services from multiple cloud providers has become the norm for many enterprises. This trend is motivated not only by the need to avoid a cloud-vendor locked-in situation but also by different CSPs offering different value-added functions for different services (e.g., IaaS, SaaS). The consequence of this trend is that \u2013 from an enterprise point of view \u2013 the following networks have become extensions of the enterprise network and, thus, come under the scope of enterprise network management with attendant responsibilities for ensuring that security protections become a critical function.\n\n- Network used for accessing the cloud services (e.g., VPNs or subscribed WANs)\n- Intercloud network (since communication between one CSP and another may be inevitable)\n- The network inside the cloud provider that needs to be navigated to access the subscribed services (e.g., VPC, VNET).\n\n### Geographic Spread of IT Resources and Users\n\nIT resources are now widely distributed not only due to the geographic spread of enterprise premises (e.g., headquarters and branch offices) but also for reliability and disaster recovery (DR) considerations. Additionally, the applications hosted in those resources are now accessed by users from various enterprise premises (through the enterprise network) as well as from home and public locations (e.g., hotels and cafes) through multiple devices, such as desktops, laptops, and mobile phones. Ensuring secure access from these varied locations and devices becomes the responsibility of the enterprise.\n\n### Changes in Application Architecture\n\nApplication architectures \u2013 especially those of cloud-native applications \u2013 have changed from being monolithic to being microservices-based in order to meet the deployment agility and modular scalability requirements. This, combined with DevSecOps (a paradigm covering Development, Security and Operations) primitives such as...# Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Security Guide\n\n## 1.3.

The Need for a Security Guide\n\nBased on the security implications discussed in the previous subsection, there is a new security scenario in the current enterprise network landscape that needs to be addressed through security guidance. Some of the salient aspects of this scenario are:\n\n- Ubiquitous access locations, ubiquitous hosting locations of the application components, and multiple WAN transport protocols have caused shifts in security focuses, goals, and principles.\n- The security focus has enlarged from being network-centric (i.e., internal/corporate network versus external/public internet) to centering on the user, device, endpoint, and service.\n- The new trust relationship has to not only be based on identity or the location of the access but enhanced to include validation of each access request (not just at the beginning of an access session), as well as the applicable set of contextual information associated with the user, device, or service.\n\n## 1.4.

However, the following factors have annulled the concept of that perimeter and greatly expanded the attack surface:\n\n- Distributed nature of the application into ones located within a corporate data center, remote branch offices, and multiple cloud locations.\n- Perimeter approach based on the premise that the threat originates outside of the network, which is why most perimeter security solutions (e.g., intrusion prevention system - IPS, intrusion detection systems - IDS, firewalls) focus only on north-south traffic (i.e., ingress, which refers to traffic that originates from outside of the local network and destined for endpoints in the local cluster network). However, over 75% of network traffic is now east-west (i.e., within the local network) or server-to-server (due to applications being based on microservices), which is largely invisible to security teams, though some visibility is now sought through endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions that collect security telemetry data on endpoints. Any threat that is already inside of a network can move laterally and remain undetected for days or even months.\n- Edge computing, where much of the computing takes place close to the location of multiple IoT devices that may be geographically dispersed.\n- Users located both within and outside of the corporate network, such as in homes, remote branch offices, and public locations (e.g., hotels, pubs); some enterprises must.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nalso provide access to ecosystem partners, who may be on their own corporate networks\n\n## 2.2. Limitations of VPN-based Access",
  "also provide access to ecosystem partners, who may be on their own corporate networks\n\n## 2.2. Limitations of VPN-based Access\n\nThe increase in teleworking employees due to the pandemic has necessitated a means for secure access to IT resources inside an enterprise network in the form of VPNs. A VPN allows organizations to extend perimeter-based security across a public network. Security is enabled by setting up a secure tunnel in the public network using protocols such as Internet Protocol Security (IPSEC) and Transport Layer Security (TLS).\n\nHowever, there are some limitations and security risks associated with VPNs.\n\n- An increasing trend involves the movement of corporate resources to the cloud and the use of mobile devices. The VPN connections that remote users establish terminate at the VPN concentrators located at the edge of the corporate network. Hence, even traffic generated during those users' cloud service access lands at the corporate internet edge and has to be validated and routed back to the internet to access the cloud resources. This phenomenon is called \"hair-pinning\", results in extra distance, increases network latency, and has the potential to cause traffic bottlenecks.\n- Periodic disclosure of vulnerabilities. Two recent examples are \"session hijacking\" and \"account ID extraction\" [2].\n- When VPNs are deployed as hardware appliances, it puts a limit on the number of users who can connect through the network gateway and limits scalability.\n- VPNs often require agents, which makes providing access in scenarios with a high volume of third-party users (contractors and partners) difficult [53].\n\n## 2.3 Limitation of MPLS Technology as Enterprise WANs\n\nMulti-protocol label switching (MPLS) technology is used for enterprise WANs, but the wide geographic span of an enterprise network with multiple data centers and cloud services has imposed some limitations on its use (in addition to cost).\n\n- The geographic span of enterprise IT resources and subsequent networking connections have made traversal through the internet inevitable for many portions of the enterprise's access network. Since MPLS is a different network, it provides access to the internet only through designated and limited access points (similar to the hair pinning phenomenon). This increases latency for time-sensitive corporate applications.\n- Given the different networking technology, the appliances and subsequent configuration procedures are different, making network management a complex task.\n\n## 2.4 Limitation of Authentication Infrastructure",

This infrastructure by itself is not sufficient to meet the authentication needs of the environment that contains microservices-based.# Applications and Infrastructure Requirements\n\nApplications, which are becoming ubiquitous in both enterprise and cloud environments. This class of application consists of loosely coupled microservices that require the generation of multiple interservice requests to complete a business process or transaction. This scenario, in turn, needs an infrastructure for also authenticating services (in addition to users) with special requirements as follows:\n\n- A portable and interoperable cryptographic identity is required for workloads or services, as well as a standardized way to retrieve, validate, and interact with those identities. An example of such a specification is Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE) [47].\n- The location of the service may change due to the virtualized nature of the application hosting environment (e.g., migration to different Virtual Machines (VMs), migration to a different pod in containerized applications). Hence, the identity should abstract the environment hosting the service.\n- The validation of identity (authentication) and authorization need to be done continuously (and not just at the beginning of a service request) as the risk profile associated with the request may change if there are multiple entities involved or if there are changes in behavioral patterns that need to be included as a validation parameter and monitored.",

Network Security Appliances in the Enterprise Network Landscape\n\nThis section considers some new network security appliances and enhanced features in established appliances for meeting the security needs of the current network landscape. These can simply be viewed as point security solutions, but evaluating their functions and features will provide an understanding of the effectiveness of network configurations and technologies that form part of the integrated solutions that will be discussed in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.\n\n### 3.1. Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)\n\nGiven the increasing subscription to multiple clouds in many enterprises, one of the most important pieces of software is the cloud access security broker (CASB). It sits on the network between the cloud service customers (CSC) and the cloud service providers (CSP). The evolution of CASB functionality can be traced as follows [3]:\n\n- The primary function of the first generation of CASBs was the discovery of resources. They provided visibility into all of the cloud resources that the enterprise users accessed, thus preventing or minimizing the chances of shadow IT. Shadow IT is the practice of some users using cloud applications that are not authorized by the enterprise IT management from home or the office using enterprise desktops. An example of this is the use of unapproved software as-a-service (SaaS) applications for file sharing, social media, collaboration, and web conferencing [4]. This generation of CASBs also provides some statistics, such as software-as-a-service (SaaS) utilization.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",

These misconfigurations pose serious security risks, such as data breaches. Alerts generated by CASB due to misconfigurations in the enterprise's IaaS deployments direct the enterprise to follow guidelines, such as the Center for Internet Security's (CIS) benchmarks for public cloud services, thus improving the overall security profile of the enterprise for cloud access [4].\n\n## 3.2. Enhanced Firewall Capabilities",
  "## 3.2. Enhanced Firewall Capabilities\n\nThe security functions in firewalls have enlarged alongside the changing network landscape. Firewalls started as hardware appliances that prevented network packets from a device with a particular network location (e.g., combination of Internet Protocol (IP) address and port) in one subnet (e.g., external network or internet) from accessing a device on another network location or subnet (e.g., intranet or Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) or corporate network). In that setup, it primarily secured a network perimeter. The evolution of firewall functions can be traced based on the following feature sets [6]:\n\n- **Packet filters and network address translation**: Packet filtering and Network address translation (NAT) are used to monitor and control packets moving across a network interface, apply predetermined security rules, and obscure the internal network from the public internet.\n- **Stateful inspection**: Stateful firewalling, also known as dynamic packet filtering, monitors the state of connections and makes determinations as to what types of data packets belong to a known active connection and can be allowed to pass through the firewall.\n- **Deep packet inspection (DPI)**: This feature, also known as packet sniffing, examines the content of packets (both the header and the payload, unlike the stateful inspection that inspects only the packet header). In addition to the capability provided by stateful inspection, this has capabilities related to finding hidden threats within the data stream, such as attempts at data exfiltration, violations of content policies, malware, and more.\n- **Threat detection and response**: Modern firewalls can gather and analyze enough data across multiple packets and sessions to detect threats and security incidents targeted at a particular system or a family of systems. These data from multiple firewalls can also be directed toward security information and event management (SIEM) and correlated.\n```# Security Tools and IT Systems\n\n## Enterprise-Wide Attack Detection\nWith data from other security tools and IT systems to detect enterprise-wide attacks that span multiple systems and network layers. In addition, these data can be used to understand evolving threats and define new access rules, attack patterns, and defensive strategies [6].\n\n## Logging and Auditing Capabilities\n- **Logging and auditing capabilities:** Logging and auditing capabilities result in the construction of network events that can be used to identify patterns of performance and security issues.",

Firewalls at the network edge perform the network perimeter protection function by filtering disallowed sources and destinations and blocking the packets of potential threats. Firewalls inside a data center can segment the internal network to prevent the lateral movement of traffic and isolate sensitive resources (e.g., services and data stores). Device-based firewalls prevent malicious traffic in and out of endpoints.\n\n## Open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)\n- **Open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs):** These enable integration with many networking products that provide additional security capabilities.\n\n## Policy Composition Capabilities\n- **Policy Composition Capabilities:** Some firewalls can have the capabilities to merge policies at enforcement time so as to ensure that consistent policies are applied to different classes of users (e.g., those on-premises and on private and public clouds).",

A feature advancement in this class of firewalls is advanced Uniform Resource Locator (URL) filtering. This is the ability to detect traffic from malicious URLs and prevent web-based threats and attacks by receiving real-time data analyzed by machine learning algorithms [7][8]. Specifically, this class of firewalls can inspect threat vectors for SQL Injection, operating system (OS) command injections, and cross-site scripting attacks, as well as prevent inbound attacks. They are used in content delivery networks (CDN) and to prevent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Some additional features found in this class of firewalls are:\n- Ability to specify an allowable list of services (control at the application level)\n- Traffic matches the intent of allowed ports\n- Filtering of some unwanted protocols\n\n## Appliance-Set with Integrated Functions\n- **Unified threat management (or UTMs):** UTM devices combine many of the most critical security functions \u2013 firewall, IPS, VPN concentrator, gateway antivirus, content filtering, and WAN load balancing \u2013 into a single device, usually with a unified management console.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT",

It can look at data not only at layers 3 and 4 of an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) stack but also at layer 7 \u2013 the application level. Its capabilities extend beyond packet filtering and stateful inspection. There are multiple deployment options available for NGFWs, such as an appliance in the data center, as a software running in a VM in a cloud, or as a cloud service (FWaaS). Some capabilities of NGFW include [9]:\n\na. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)\nb. TLS decryption and inspection of packet payload\nc.

It also protects user endpoints from web-based threats that can occur when users click on links to malicious websites or to websites infected with malware. They centralize control, visibility, and reporting across many locations and types of users. They are not a replacement for WAFs, which protect websites housed in enterprise data centers and large headquarter sites from inbound attacks.",

It also protects user endpoints from web-based threats that can occur when users click on links to malicious websites or to websites infected with malware. They centralize control, visibility, and reporting across many locations and types of users. They are not a replacement for WAFs, which protect websites housed in enterprise data centers and large headquarter sites from inbound attacks.\n\n## Network Security Automation Tools\nNetwork security automation tools automate the life cycle processes involved in deployment, observability/monitoring, threat intelligence gathering/reporting (e.g., generating alerts of security violations for security personnel to take timely action), and \u2013 in some instances \u2013 automatic remediation. These automated tools are an indispensable part of the current enterprise network landscape, especially those that consist of highly distributed on-premises and cloud-based IT resources.\n\nThe security capabilities of network tools fall under the category of policy enforcement point (PEP) security capabilities that are extensively discussed in CISA's TIC 3.0 Cloud Use Case [51]. Guidance for the deployment of these capabilities is also covered in that document. The intent of the material in this section is to highlight some higher-level metrics that this category of tools should satisfy in order to perform their intended functions effectively; it is not meant to be used as deployment guidance. Each higher-level metric is tagged with the abbreviation NSATHLM-x, where NSAT stands for network security automation tool, HLM stands for high-level metric, and x stands for the numerical sequence.\n\n### NSAT-HLM-1\nThe tools should scale to meet the volume, velocity, and variety of today's application development, deployment, and maintenance paradigms [13].\n```# Requirement for Network Security Automation Tools",

These tools are an integral part of the smart automated workflows called CI/CD pipelines, which invoke them to deploy servers (computing), networking, and storage infrastructure. Hence, this class of network automation tools should have the capability to be seamlessly integrated into the corresponding CI/CD pipelines.\n\n## NSAT-HLM-2\nThe tools should have the capability to minimize human intervention for security remediation, which is slow and prone to error.

The requirements and feature set for these two classes alone are discussed in the following subsections.\n\n### 3.4.1. Network Monitoring and Observability Tools\nThis class of tools gathers these data for obtaining visibility into the entire network. These data are then used to generate a dashboard that presents the topography of the enterprise network by showing all connections and presenting key operating parameters (e.g., latency, network traffic level). Some of these data generated by this class of tool and their uses are:\n\n- **Identification of Interfaces:** Monitoring tools identify the interfaces (called tracepoints) for defining the parameters for network resource provisioning and help the IaC generate the relevant code for invoking those interfaces.\n\n- **Measurement of Drift:** Despite using IaC to deploy the network infrastructure, unauthorized or ad hoc changes in network configuration can alter the performance and security parameters for application execution (called the drift). Monitoring tools should have the ability to monitor these drift parameters (e.g., bandwidth availability, unwanted traffic) and alert for corrective action.\n\n- **Secure Overlay Designs for Cloud Service Access:** Monitoring tools can generate data to enable centralized network management tools to perform security functions, such as building a virtual network segmentation on top of the native network segmentation features offered by CSP, provided that suitable APIs are available.\n\n- **Support for Incident Response Processes:** Sophisticated network monitoring tools generate network security alerts and threat intelligence feeds.

A security strategy that has evolved in recent years to automate the IR process is called security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR). Some of the state of practice applications of SOAR include threat detection and response, vulnerability prioritization, compliance checks, and security audits with potential applications in many emerging areas, such as IoT management [15].\n\n## 3.4.2. Automated Network Provisioning Tools\n\nAs already stated, automated network resource provisioning is enabled by infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools. The code that describes the networking infrastructure (in addition to the computing and storage infrastructure) is stored in a code repository. The initial deployment of the networking infrastructure and subsequent upgrade is automated by defining a workflow that invokes the IaC (e.g., GitOps workflow) as part of a CI/CD pipeline definition [16].\n\n### Advantages of This Approach\n\nThe advantages of this approach for managing the enterprise networking infrastructure for multicloud deployment are:",

The initial deployment of the networking infrastructure and subsequent upgrade is automated by defining a workflow that invokes the IaC (e.g., GitOps workflow) as part of a CI/CD pipeline definition [16].\n\n### Advantages of This Approach\n\nThe advantages of this approach for managing the enterprise networking infrastructure for multicloud deployment are:\n\n- It enables the enterprise to have tight version control (tracking changes) so that unauthorized networking devices and changes in associated configurations do not open up security vulnerabilities.\n- It enables the enterprise to have a uniform infrastructure across all environments \u2013 development, testing, staging, and production.\n- Monitoring the drift (the unintended changes) between the defined infrastructure (as found in IaC) and the operational infrastructure (as measured by monitoring tools described in Section 3.4.1) and taking corrective action to address the drift help to maintain the necessary security posture for the enterprise networking environment.\n- The DevSecOps paradigm consisting of CI/CD pipelines invokes the network provisioning tool (IaC code generator) to automate the initial deployment and subsequent reconfiguration of the networking infrastructure. Since the pipelines have a built-in audit process, the changes in network configuration are automatically captured in the audit, which enables the enterprise to demonstrate corporate security policy compliance and regulatory policy compliance for their networks where applicable.\n- Testing the code (IaC code) generated by IaC tools (and invoked by the CI/CD pipeline code that deploys the infrastructure using IaC in the DevSecOps process) ensures that security policies are consistently and uniformly applied across the entire enterprise networking infrastructure (i.e., multiple cloud services).\n- The advantage of having plug-ins for defining network provisioning for different public cloud provider environments is that they can be used to customize the observability tools used for network monitoring for each of those cloud services that the enterprise has subscribed to [17].# 3.5. Networking Appliances as Services\n\nAnother trend in the enterprise network landscape is that a portion of network infrastructure can be obtained from third-party providers as a leased service called a network as a service (NaaS).

  "Another trend in the enterprise network landscape is that a portion of network infrastructure can be obtained from third-party providers as a leased service called a network as a service (NaaS). This service is offered using technologies such as enterprise 5G and edge computing. The advantages of NaaS are:\n\n- Just like subscriptions to SaaS and IaaS, it reduces capex costs for the enterprise.\n- It is flexible and scalable since it is software-defined and virtualized.\n- As a consequence of the previous advantage, quality of service (QoS) requirements of diverse applications can be met by creating customized traffic flow for each application type [18].\n- New applications that require an increased network footprint can be quickly introduced to the enterprise, thus facilitating agile business diversification.\n\nHowever, they are limited point security solutions rather than comprehensive solutions that address all aspects of enterprise security.\n\n# 4. Network Configurations for Basic Security Functions\n\nAny enterprise-wide secure network that consists of on-premises and cloud-hosted applications should be based on an established security framework. In turn, security frameworks consist of many basic security functions. The purpose of this section is to describe the network configurations or designs (and network communication exchanges based on them) that have emerged as the state of practice for implementing these security functions. The state of practice network configuration features (NCF) found in enterprises with hybrid application environments can be classified under the following areas [19]:\n\n- Network configuration for Device Management\n- Network configuration for User Authentication\n- Network configuration for Device Authentication and Health Monitoring\n- Network configuration for Authorizing Application/Service Access\n- Network configurations for Preventing Attack Escalation\n\nEach of the network configuration features is enumerated using the identifier of the form HAENCF-x, where HAE denotes a hybrid application environment, NCF denotes the network configuration feature, and x stands for the sequence number of the feature.

Conceptual Underpinning \u2013 Contextual Information\n\nSection 2.4 discussed the limitation of using user identity alone to authorize application requests. However, this does not mean that identity verification can be relegated to a secondary requirement. It has been widely recognized that identity validation is the entry point (may be a highly-vulnerable point of entry into the system) to an application request [26] since all requests \u2013 whether coming from a service (or microservice), user, or device \u2013 come with a claimed identity. This identity must be verified using robust, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. However, other attributes associated with the user and the information.# Contextual Information in Access Requests\n\nAssociated with other entities involved in an application access request, such as devices and services, are required in current enterprise IT environments and are collectively called contextual information. This contextual information set may vary from one enterprise to another and is based on the level of trust that the organization requires for a particular access request. Since the role of contextual information in potential attacks may not be known, the set to be included in the access decision is a risk-based decision. Contextual information may broadly belong to the following five key areas [27]:\n\n## 1. Information about the user requesting access\nApart from user identity, attributes associated with the user, such as their role in the organization, current assignments, and status (cross verification of identity in the enterprise identity management (IDM) system vs enterprise directory).",

Information about the device from which access is being requested\nEstablishing trust in the device through a combination of health and risk profiles of the device. For example, the risk profile of the device can be obtained through an out-of-the-box posture check (risk of the device [28]) with or without integrating with an endpoint protection tool for the device. Other crucial information (provided by telemetry data) needed to assess the security status of the endpoint devices [29] include (a) device support label (the device is managed or corporate-owned) and (b) device posture information (whether it has been compromised). All of these factors go into a policy evaluation for determining the level of trust and must be channeled into authentication and monitoring decisions [30].\n\n## 3. Information about real-time contextual data\nDate, time, and geolocation at which the access request occurs.\n\n## 4. Information about IT services (e.g., app, data) being accessed.\n\n## 5. Information about the security of the environment hosting the IT services being accessed.\n\n### The requirements for contextual information [27]:\n- Should include not only that which is collected by the native platform (the platform on which the application is hosted) but also that which can be obtained from third-party platforms and can provide more detailed information.\n- Should be available in real time so that user experience with access is not affected.\n- Should be prioritized based on the value each provides.\n- Should be consistent with the level of risk associated with each access request.",

Also termed as \"verifier impersonation-resistant\", these authenticators should meet the requirements at level AAL3 in NIST guidance SP 800-63-3 [50].\n\n# 4.4 Network Configuration for Device Authentication and Health Monitoring\n\n**HAE-NCF-3:** Device authentication can be performed through certificate validation using appropriate protocols. A device health check may involve both its security posture (e.g., the version of an operating system it is running, the patches that have been applied, the security software that is installed) and environmental information, such as geolocation.\n\n# 4.5 Network Configuration for Authorizing Application/Service Access\n\n**HAE-NCF-4:** Standardized protocols, such as OAuth 2.0 [20], should be used to issue access tokens to the validated user, device, or service to enable access to cloud-based applications.",

Further, visibility into microservices runtime behavior (and the ability to provide more dynamic security controls) can be enabled by attaching eBPF programs [52] to tracepoint events (the entry to or exit from any function in kernel or user space).\n\n# 4.6 Network Configurations for Preventing Attack Escalation\n\nThe network configurations for attack escalation prevention are techniques used to realize ZTNA and are discussed in the next section. Two established configurations are:\n\n1. Microsegmentation\n2. Software-defined perimeter (SDP)\n\n# 5.

A predominant strategy that has been endorsed by both government and industry for hybrid enterprises is zero trust (ZT).

Working with many stakeholders, NIST has defined zero trust and zero trust principles as follows [33]:\n\n- **Zero trust (ZT)** is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. It is a set of security primitives rather than a particular set of technologies. Zero trust assumes that there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or on asset ownership (e.g., enterprise or personally owned). Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (e.g., assets, services, workflows, network accounts) rather than network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource.\n\n- **A zero trust architecture (ZTA)** uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows.\n\nNIST's guidance on zero trust also contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise's overall information technology security posture.

From the NIST vision of ZTA and state of practice implementations [34], the following have emerged as the three building blocks of ZTA:\n\n1. **Client or Browser**: The point of entry for all users to access any resources hosted in multi-cloud and on-premises environments.\n2. **The Controller**: The policy decision point (PDP), which evaluates access requests based on the policies, conditions, and entitlements that grant access for all users, devices, and workloads from a single dashboard or via API.\n3. **The Gateway**: The policy enforcement point (PEP), a gateway that controls the flow of access to protected resources and dynamically builds micro-segmentation rules based on granted entitlements.\n\nAs already stated, the two established network configuration techniques for enabling ZTNA are microsegmentation and SDP, which are both discussed in the following subsections.\n\n## 5.1 Microsegmentation# Microsegmentation\n\nMicrosegmentation is a security design practice where an internal network (e.g., in the data center, cloud provider region) is divided into isolated segments so that the traffic in and out of each segment can be monitored and controlled [21]. The primary purpose of microsegmentation is to provide a degree of isolation to prevent attack escalation.\n\n## Capabilities enabled by microsegmentation include:\n\n- Segments being isolated and relatively small enables close monitoring of the traffic because of better visibility.\n- The consequence of the above capability is that granular access control is possible by defining associated policies.\n\nThe above capabilities restrict the unauthorized lateral movement of a user or application that has either (a) breached the perimeter to enter the internal network or (b) been initiated by users within the internal network itself.\n\n### 5.1.1 Prerequisites for Implementing Microsegmentation",

Prior to the era of cloud-based applications, the application requests were validated based on the IP subnet or IP address from which they originated. Ubiquitous access and multi-clouds have eliminated the concept of network perimeters. Hence, authentication and authorization based on those parameters are neither feasible nor scalable.

A unique application identity is inevitable.\n\n- **Establishment of trust in application identity:** The created application (workload or service) identity should not be subject to spoofing and should be continuously verifiable. An example of workload identity is a SPIFFE ID [47]. A SPIFFE ID is a string that uniquely and specifically identifies a workload and is encoded as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which takes the following format: `spiffe://trust domain/workload identifier` where the workload identifier uniquely identifies a specific workload within a trust domain. The SPIFFE ID is carried in a cryptographically-verifiable document called a SVID (SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document). The two formats supported for SVID in SPIFFE specification are a short-lived X.509 certificate or a Java Web Token (JWT) token.\n\n- **Discovery of application resources:** There should be a robust secure method for discovering all application resources (e.g., services, networks), called service discovery capability.\n\n- **Segmentation of workloads:** Security requirements for all applications and...# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nServices must be identified and groupings established based on identical security requirements.\n\n- **Mapping of logical application groupings to physical or virtual infrastructures:**\nApplication-centric groupings must be mapped to physical or virtual infrastructures that constitute the data center topology to facilitate actual applications and services deployment.\n\n## 5.1.2 Microsegmentation \u2013 Implementation Approaches",

In this approach, the applications and service resources with similar security requirements are grouped into a unique segment, and firewall rules are created to block or allow communication with each group or segment. The segments are created using network layer abstractions, such as VLAN IDs or some other tagging approaches, while policies are defined using network address constructs (e.g., IP addresses and ports). Policies apply to subnets (e.g., VLANs) and not to individual hosts.\n\nEach segment is protected by gateway devices, such as intelligent switches and routers or next-generation firewalls (NGFWs), which should have the capacity to react and adapt in response to the threats and changes in the application workflows. Segmentation gateways monitor traffic, stop threats, and enforce granular access across east-west traffic (rarely for north-south traffic) within on-premises data centers or cloud regions. The main difficulty with this approach is in mapping the applications' security requirements-based segments to corresponding network segments [23].\n\nAnother difficulty is change management. The mapping between applications and network identities that are being statically maintained has to continuously be kept in sync with the operational scenario where the application's network locations are continuously changing due to performance and security reasons.",

The mapping between applications and network identities that are being statically maintained has to continuously be kept in sync with the operational scenario where the application's network locations are continuously changing due to performance and security reasons.\n\nA schematic diagram of the segment-based microsegmentation is shown in Figure 1. Each numbered microsegment in the figure is a unique VLAN identified by a VLAN ID. The group of applications that will run in that particular VLAN segment can be defined using different criteria, one of which is \"all applications with similar security requirements.\" Another criterion is that \"all tiers (web front-end, application logic servers, and database servers) associated with a particular application\" should run in a single microsegment, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe following are some approaches that are employed to implement microsegmentation [22]:\n\na. **Virtualized server-based approach:** This approach is only applicable to networks that contain virtualized servers since it is implemented in the hypervisor. There are two possible mechanisms:\n1. Using virtual firewalls inside a hypervisor to isolate traffic destined for different VMs.# Inside the Hypervisor\n\n2.

Using encapsulation techniques to create overlays (e.g., Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN)) that run on top of an underlying network that consists of IP addresses designations; access control policies are enforced on the hypervisor itself outside of the workload (application or microservice).\n\nb.

It leverages native firewall functionality built into the host. Software agents can overlay a software-defined segmented network across data centers, cloud, bare metal, and hybrid environments. The agent provides context awareness and visibility for each workload and enables the definition and enforcement of fine-grained policies.\n\nc. Identity-based microsegmentation: Identity-based microsegmentation policies use contextual, application-driven identifiers (e.g., order processing front-end service can communicate with inventory back-end service) instead of network parameters (permit calls from 192.168.10.x subnet to 10.0.0.31) [24]. The identifiers assigned to services are cryptographic identities (as discussed in Section 5.1.1), which they use for mutual authentication and authorization during each service request and response.\n\nThe advantages of this type of microsegmentation are:\n\n- Policies based on service/application identities do not use any infrastructure-related variables (e.g., IP addresses, subnets), so these policies are environment-agnostic and provide the freedom for the services/applications to be migrated to different environments and still maintain the same policies.\n- Policies being independent of infrastructure enables them to be tested by merely exercising the application and observing the outcomes (e.g., trace of the sequence of service calls and requests/responses instead of configuring the infrastructure correctly for test runs).\n- With the availability of tools for the declarative specification of policies through \"policy as code\" tools (PaC), microsegmentation policies can be defined and implemented by incorporating the code into automated workflows, such as CI/CD pipelines.\n- Microsegmentation enables granular (fine-grained) access control by providing visibility into application call sequences/interdependencies and data flows through host-level tracking, thus enabling the enforcement of security policies for application traffic that is both north-south and east-west, irrespective of the environment (e.g., corporate data center or cloud infrastructure).",
  "The reason that identity-based microsegmentation is to be included under the enterprise network landscape is that it enables only valid network traffic between the various component services of the application due to the mutual authentication and authorization of the service identities, thus enabling the goals of ZTNA to be met [25].\n\n## 5.2 Software-defined Perimeter (SDP)# One conceptual underpinning for secure network access to IT resources is the software-defined perimeter (SDP) [31].\n\nIn SDP, the separation between networks is not defined by network address group or VLANs, making it network-agnostic. It is logically and dynamically defined for each user and each particular request. In other words, for each user request, the subset of IT resources to which the user has access is dynamically allocated irrespective of the location of the resource (e.g., corporate data center, branch office, private or public cloud).\n\nThe salient principles of SDP include:\n\n- The SDP concept involves making all IT resources invisible (e.g., ports, workloads, and applications) and making them known and accessible only after the user is authenticated and authorized. Only a network connection between the user and the allowed IT resources is established, thus following the least privilege principle.\n- The access level determined by the previous process is continuously reevaluated during the user session and recalibrated if required. As the context surrounding the identity changes in real time, so can the user's entitlements [31].\n- The attack surface is reduced by preventing lateral movement [32] through techniques like microsegmentation, as described in Section 5.1. With the increasing deployment of microservices, the inter-services resource requests (generator of east-west traffic) dominate external application requests (north-south traffic). Application of this principle thus secures east-west traffic.\n\nIn all security frameworks for current enterprise network environments, the common principles that underlie application-specific requirements \u2013 such as low latency, high data transfer rates, and high reliability \u2013 that were applicable in previous network landscapes remain the same.\n\n## 6. Secure Wide Area Network Infrastructure for an Enterprise Network",
  "In all security frameworks for current enterprise network environments, the common principles that underlie application-specific requirements \u2013 such as low latency, high data transfer rates, and high reliability \u2013 that were applicable in previous network landscapes remain the same.\n\n## 6. Secure Wide Area Network Infrastructure for an Enterprise Network\n\nThe wide area network (WAN) became an integral part of the enterprise network when organizations needed to connect their local area networks (LANs) across multiple geographically distributed locations (within the country and, in some cases, globally) starting in the 1980s. The initial WAN technology involved point-to-point (P2P) leased lines followed by frame relay. The first IP-based network was multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), which enabled multiple types of traffic \u2013 such as voice, video, and data \u2013 to travel on the same line.\n\nWith the advent of technologies such as virtualization and increasing enterprise access to cloud services, enterprises have begun to adopt a new WAN technology called the software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN). SD-WAN technology removes the tight coupling between the control plane and data plane functions of the network and enables the centralized specification of various policies, such as access control, routing, and application traffic prioritization.\n\nAnother development integrates all of the point security solutions provided by various network security appliances (Section 3) into a network security services infrastructure.# Industry and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)\n\nIndustry and industry consortiums use the term **secure access service edge (SASE)** [35] to refer to a comprehensive framework that offers wide area networking and various security services. SASE can be looked upon as the networking counterpart of the application's service mesh, which provides a comprehensive set of application services, including security for cloud-native applications.\n\nBased on the above discussion, this section will focus on the following topics:\n\n- Requirements for a secure SD-WAN\n- Specific requirements for SD-WANs for cloud access\n- Requirements for an integrated security services architecture for SD-WAN\n\n## 6.1.

Common Requirements for a Secure SD-WAN\n\nIn addition to CSP-provided VPNs, a networking technology that provides network connectivity for accessing cloud-based services for enterprises is **software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN)**. The design goals and common features in all SD-WAN offerings include:\n\n- **Extensive connectivity:** To securely connect users located anywhere (e.g., home, public location, branch office, corporate office) to applications and resources hosted anywhere (e.g., data center, single or multiple cloud services) using any WAN transport (e.g., MPLS, Broadband Internet, 4G/LTE, 5G wireless).\n\n- **Application awareness:** To monitor the network traffic and dynamically choose the best path available based on (a) the type of network traffic, (b) network load conditions, and (c) the application's business priority. This capability is enabled using techniques such as bandwidth utilization, load balancing, and the optimization of speed by reducing jitters, latency, and packet loss. Addressing an application's business priority is only possible if the SD-WAN solution has the ability to identify different types of applications (e.g., messaging/email application, social media application, general storage-related applications, supply chain applications) and allocate routing priorities and WAN resources accordingly.\n\n- **Integration of security and networking functions:** Use of appliances that contain a combination of networking and security functions (e.g., the presence of a firewall and secure web gateway [SWG] functions in a WAN router) [36].\n\n- **Centralized visibility and management capabilities:** Includes the ability to recognize and authenticate newly connected appliances and bring them under the defined management workflows as nodes so as to configure a uniform set of policies that cover all components.",

This feature enables the connectivity of SD-WAN into the local LAN at the remote branch offices.\n\n## 6.2. Specific Requirements for SD-WANs for Cloud Access\n\nEnterprises can gain cloud access in two ways: 1) through the VPN services.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nprovided by the cloud providers or 2) by integrating their own SD-WAN with cloud providers' private networks, often called the cloud WAN. In both scenarios, it is possible for enterprises to enforce their enterprise networking and security policies even though the endpoint resources are located in a cloud provider's private network.\n\n- In the first scenario, cloud access is enabled by the availability of the feature provided by many CSPs for each subscriber to establish their own private subnets and a networking connection between two of those private subnets (e.g., VPC peering). It is then possible for resources (e.g., VM instances) in either of the private subnets to communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.\n\n- In the second scenario (i.e., connectivity through SD-WAN), the same feature can be availed of once inside the CSP network. In addition, further orchestration of the cloud provider's private network can be achieved by designing a customized overlay network on top of the cloud provider's network with the latter as the underlay network. This feature is contingent upon CSPs offering API integrations for different SD-WAN offerings [38][39][40].\n\nThe overall advantages of being able to orchestrate the CSP private network for the subscriber enterprise are:",

A portion of the industry calls the collection of appliances in this architecture a cloud network platform. The requirements for this multi-cloud networking platform are [41]:\n\n- It should deliver common operational visibility and control across native network access provided by multiple cloud providers. The primary challenge is that public cloud providers have different proprietary architectures using their own \"constructs\". In order to provide a networking architecture that can \"cross clouds\", one needs to leverage the cloud-native functionality (especially native cloud networking constructs) of each cloud; abstract that functionality with APIs; add advanced data plane features for high availability, security, and operational visibility/control; and provide the tools to manage these features dynamically or automatically [42].\n\n- It should deliver a common ingress and egress security policy for application environments (e.g., VPCs, VNETs, VCNs) across clouds.\n\n- It should enable end-to-end encryption inside of the cloud as well as high-performance encryption from the data center to the cloud.\n\n- It should support automation for deployment and configuration.",

This layer enables the enterprise to manage the entire enterprise network \u2013 consisting of connectivity to multiple clouds, intra-cloud connections, and the on-premises data center network fabrics \u2013 as one unit. To enable this, complete visibility into the entire enterprise network landscape is needed. Hence, this layer needs input from sophisticated observability and monitoring tools to carry out its functions.\n\n- A virtual network configuration that sits on the top of the network provided by each CSP for hosting CSC applications. The capability to define this virtual network configuration can be automated by a class of tools called IaC tools, which have features with network configuration definitions of major CSPs built in as plug-ins. These tools facilitate initial network resource provisioning and configuration and subsequent re-provisioning and reconfiguration as application access requirements change.\n\nThere are four industry trends [43] that may have security implications with regard to SD-WAN [44]:",

Secure remote access functionalities provided by technologies such as VPN are combined into SD-WAN [45].\n\n## 6.3. Requirements for an Integrated Security Services Architecture for SD-WAN\n\nAn integrated security services architecture for SD-WAN has both networking and security functions integrated within it. The network access and security function capabilities are offered as a cloud service that enterprises can access through strategic network locations spread over a wide area called point of presence (PoP). In 2019, Gartner coined the term \"secure access service edge\" (SASE) to denote an architecture that converges networking and security functions and delivers them at a global scale as a cloud service [46]. The networking and security services delivered by an SASE are not new but simply delivered together as a single package rather than through point security solutions (Section 3). The various points of connectivity from the enterprise to SASE PoPs are called enterprise edges. The enterprise edges can be either:\n\n- Clients \u2013 Users accessing through desktops, laptops, and mobile devices from either branch offices or remote locations, such as their homes or IoTs.\n- IT resources \u2013 Internal applications hosted in data centers, branch offices, or the cloud.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## (e.g., SaaS, IaaS)\n\nThe SASE network infrastructure thus becomes an integral part of the enterprise network whenever one or more of the enterprise edges are connected to various PoPs of SASE cloud services.\n\nThe four primary functions delivered by SASE are [46]:",

In some instances, major cloud vendors' PoPs may also be leveraged.\n- **Security agent on devices** \u2013 The security agent on the end user's device undertakes networking decisions and directs traffic from different applications. Specific capabilities include dynamically allowing or denying connections to services and applications based on an organization's defined business rules.\n\nThe following are the minimal security services found in most commercial SASE offerings:\n\n- Firewall services\n- Secure web gateway services\n- Anti-malware services\n- IPS services\n- CASB services\n- DLP services\n\nSome of the advanced security features found in SASE offerings include:\n\n- **Browser isolation technology**: This is often combined with secure web gateway solutions and provides improved web activity security to tackle threats in real time.\n- **Continuous adaptive risk and trust assessment (CARTA) strategy**: This strategy involves constantly monitoring sessions and performs adaptive behavior analysis on monitoring parameters to dynamically change security levels and permissions if the trust profile (e.g., trust deficit) of a device changes.",

Summary and Conclusions\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide insights into the current enterprise network landscape in terms of topology, traffic flows, and security threats.
