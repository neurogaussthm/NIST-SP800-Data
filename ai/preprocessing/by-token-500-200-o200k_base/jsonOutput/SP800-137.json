  "# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIn today's environment where many, if not all, of an organization's mission-critical functions are dependent upon information technology, the ability to manage this technology and to assure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information is now also mission-critical. In designing the enterprise architecture and corresponding security architecture, an organization seeks to securely meet the IT infrastructure needs of its governance structure, missions, and core business processes. Information security is a dynamic process that must be effectively and proactively managed for an organization to identify and respond to new vulnerabilities, evolving threats, and an organization's constantly changing enterprise architecture and operational environment.\n\nThe Risk Management Framework (RMF) developed by NIST, describes a disciplined and structured process that integrates information security and risk management activities into the system development life cycle. Ongoing monitoring is a critical part of that risk management process. In addition, an organization's overall security architecture and accompanying security program are monitored to ensure that organization-wide operations remain within an acceptable level of risk, despite any changes that occur. Timely, relevant, and accurate information is vital, particularly when resources are limited and agencies must prioritize their efforts.\n\nInformation security continuous monitoring (ISCM) is defined as maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk management decisions.\n\nAny effort or process intended to support ongoing monitoring of information security across an organization begins with leadership defining a comprehensive ISCM strategy encompassing technology, processes, procedures, operating environments, and people. This strategy:\n\n- Is grounded in a clear understanding of organizational risk tolerance and helps officials set priorities and manage risk consistently throughout the organization;\n- Includes metrics that provide meaningful indications of security status at all organizational tiers;\n- Ensures continued effectiveness of all security controls;\n- Verifies compliance with information security requirements derived from organizational missions/business functions, federal legislation, directives, regulations, policies, and standards/guidelines;\n- Is informed by all organizational IT assets and helps to maintain visibility into the security of the assets;\n- Ensures knowledge and control of changes to organizational systems and environments of operation; and\n- Maintains awareness of threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nAn ISCM program is established to collect information in accordance with preestablished.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nMetrics, utilizing information readily available in part through implemented security controls.",

This process involves the entire organization, from senior leaders providing governance and strategic vision to individuals developing, implementing, and operating individual systems in support of the organization's core missions and business processes. Subsequently, determinations are made from an organizational perspective on whether to conduct mitigation activities or to reject, transfer, or accept risk.\n\nOrganizations' security architectures, operational security capabilities, and monitoring processes will improve and mature over time to better respond to the dynamic threat and vulnerability landscape. An organization's ISCM strategy and program are routinely reviewed for relevance and are revised as needed to increase visibility into assets and awareness of vulnerabilities. This further enables data-driven control of the security of an organization's information infrastructure, and increase organizational resilience.\n\nOrganization-wide monitoring cannot be efficiently achieved through manual processes alone or through automated processes alone. Where manual processes are used, the processes are repeatable and verifiable to enable consistent implementation. Automated processes, including the use of automated support tools (e.g., vulnerability scanning tools, network scanning devices), can make the process of continuous monitoring more cost-effective, consistent, and efficient.",

Real-time monitoring of implemented technical controls using automated tools can provide an organization with a much more dynamic view of the effectiveness of those controls and the security posture of the organization. It is important to recognize that with any comprehensive information security program, all implemented security controls, including management and operational controls, must be regularly assessed for effectiveness, even if the monitoring of such controls cannot be automated or is not easily automated.\n\nOrganizations take the following steps to establish, implement, and maintain ISCM:\n\n- Define an ISCM strategy;\n- Establish an ISCM program;\n- Implement an ISCM program;\n- Analyze data and report findings;\n- Respond to findings; and\n- Review and update the ISCM strategy and program.\n\nA robust ISCM program thus enables organizations to move from compliance-driven risk management to data-driven risk management providing organizations with information necessary.```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\nto support risk response decisions, security status information, and ongoing insight into security control effectiveness.\n\n## CHAPTER ONE\n\n### INTRODUCTION",

This publication specifically addresses assessment and analysis of security control effectiveness and of organizational security status in accordance with organizational risk tolerance. Security control effectiveness is measured by correctness of implementation and by how adequately the implemented controls meet organizational needs in accordance with current risk tolerance (i.e., is the control implemented in accordance with the security plan to address threats and is the security plan adequate).\n\nOrganizational security status is determined using metrics established by the organization to best convey the security posture of an organization's information and information systems, along with organizational resilience given known threat information. This necessitates:\n\n- Maintaining situational awareness of all systems across the organization;\n- Maintaining an understanding of threats and threat activities;\n- Assessing all security controls;\n- Collecting, correlating, and analyzing security-related information;\n- Providing actionable communication of security status across all tiers of the organization; and\n- Active management of risk by organizational officials.\n\nCommunication with all stakeholders is key in developing the strategy and implementing the program. This document builds on the monitoring concepts introduced in NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach. An ISCM program helps to ensure that deployed security controls continue to be effective and that operations remain within stated organizational risk tolerances in light of the inevitable changes that occur over time. In cases where security controls are determined to be inadequate, ISCM programs facilitate prioritized security response actions based on risk.",

In cases where security controls are determined to be inadequate, ISCM programs facilitate prioritized security response actions based on risk.\n\nAn ISCM strategy is meaningful only within the context of broader organizational needs, objectives, or strategies, and as part of a broader risk management strategy, enabling timely management, assessment, and response to emerging security issues. Information collected through the ISCM program supports ongoing authorization decisions.\n\nISCM, a critical step in an organization's Risk Management Framework (RMF), gives organizational officials access to security-related information on demand, enabling timely risk management decisions, including authorization decisions. Frequent updates to security plans, security assessment reports, plans of action and milestones, hardware and software inventories,\n``````markdown\nand other system information are also supported.

While this document encourages the use of automation, it is recognized that many aspects of ISCM programs are not easily automated.\n\n# 1.1 BACKGROUND\n\nThe concept of monitoring information system security has long been recognized as sound management practice. In 1997, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III required agencies to review their information systems' security controls and to ensure that system changes do not have a significant impact on security, that security plans remain effective, and that security controls continue to perform as intended. The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 further emphasized the importance of continuously monitoring information system security by requiring agencies to conduct assessments of security controls at a frequency appropriate to risk, but no less than annually.\n\nMost recently, OMB issued memorandum M-11-33, FY 2011 Reporting Instructions for the Federal Information Security Management Act and Agency Privacy Management. The memorandum provides instructions for annual FISMA reporting and emphasizes monitoring the security state of information systems on an ongoing basis with a frequency sufficient to make ongoing, risk-based decisions.\n\nTools supporting automated monitoring of some aspects of information systems have become an effective means for both data capture and data analysis. Ease of use, accessibility, and broad applicability across products and across vendors help to ensure that monitoring tools can be readily deployed in support of near real-time, risk-based decision making.\n\n# 1.2 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS",

NIST SP 800-37 describes monitoring security controls at the system level (RMF Step 6) and also includes an organization-wide perspective, integration with the system development life cycle (SDLC), and support for ongoing authorizations. The concepts presented in NIST SP 800-39 and NIST SP 800-37 are expanded upon in order to provide guidelines sufficient for developing an ISCM strategy and implementing an ISCM program.\n\nThe tiered approach herein mirrors that described in NIST SP 800-37 and NIST SP 800-39 where Tier 1 is organization, Tier 2 is mission/business processes, and Tier 3 is information systems. In NIST SP 800-39, these tiers are used to address risk management from varying organizational perspectives.

The ISCM program will evolve over time as the program matures in general, additional tools and resources become available, measurement and automation capabilities mature, and changes are implemented to ensure continuous improvement in the organizational security posture and in the organization's security program. The monitoring strategy is regularly reviewed for relevance and accuracy in reflecting organizational risk tolerances, correctness of measurements, applicability of metrics, and effectiveness in supporting risk management decisions.\n\n## 1.3 Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this guideline is to assist organizations in the development of an ISCM strategy and the implementation of an ISCM program that provides awareness of threats and vulnerabilities, visibility into organizational assets, and the effectiveness of deployed security controls.

These requirements may come from any tier in the organization. Organizations implement ISCM based on requirements of those accountable and responsible for maintaining ongoing control of organizational security posture to within organizational risk tolerances. The implementation is standardized across the organization to the greatest extent possible so as to minimize use of resources (e.g., funding for purchase of tools/applications, data calls, organization-wide policies/procedures/templates, etc.) and to maximize leveragability of security-related information. Upon analysis, the resulting information informs the discrete processes used to manage the organization's security posture and overall risk. ISCM helps to provide situational awareness of the security status of the organization's systems based on information collected from resources (e.g., people, processes, technology, environment) and the capabilities in place to react as the situation changes.\n\nISCM is a tactic in a larger strategy of organization-wide risk management. Organizations increase situational awareness through enhanced monitoring capabilities and subsequently increase insight into and control of the processes used to manage organizational security. Increased insight into and control of security processes in turn enhances\n```# Situational Awareness\n\nTherefore, the process of implementing ISCM is recursive.

Increased insight into and control of security processes in turn enhances\n```# Situational Awareness\n\nTherefore, the process of implementing ISCM is recursive. ISCM informs and is informed by distinct organizational security processes and associated requirements for input and output of security-related information. Consider the following example:\n\nSecurity-related information pertaining to a system component inventory is used to determine compliance with CM-8 Information System Component Inventory. The information is assessed to determine whether or not the control is effective, (i.e., if the inventory is accurate). If found to be inaccurate, an analysis to determine the root cause of the inaccuracy is initiated (e.g., perhaps a process for connecting components to the network has been ignored or is out of date, asset management tools are not operating as expected, or the organization is under attack). Based on the analysis, responses are initiated as appropriate (e.g., responsible parties update inventory, update relevant organizational processes, train employees, disconnect errant devices, etc.).\n\nAdditionally, security-related information pertaining to a system component inventory may be used to support predefined metrics. More accurate system component inventories support improved effectiveness of other security domains such as patch management and vulnerability management.\n\nThis example illustrates how data collected in assessing a security control is leveraged to calculate a metric and provide input into various organizational processes. It further illustrates that a problem, once detected, can trigger an assessment of one or more controls across an organization, updates to relevant security-related information, modifications to the organizational security program plan and security processes, and improved compliance to the security program and applicable system security plan. The end result is improved organization-wide risk management and continual improvement limited only by the speed with which the organization can collect information and respond to findings.\n\n## 2.1 Organization-Wide View of ISCM\n\nMaintaining an up-to-date view of information security risks across an organization is a complex, multifaceted undertaking. It requires the involvement of the entire organization, from senior leaders providing governance and strategic vision to individuals developing, implementing, and operating individual information systems in support of the organization's core missions and business functions.",

Tier 1 governance, risk management goals, and organizational risk tolerance drive the ISCM strategy. Organizational risk tolerance established by senior executives/leaders as part of the risk executive (function) influences ISCM policy, procedures, and implementation activities across all tiers. Data collection primarily occurs at the information systems tier. Metrics are designed to present information in a context that is meaningful for each.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\ntier. For example, ISCM data collected at Tier 3 may be aggregated to provide security status or risk scores for a single system, for a collection of systems, across a core business process, or for the entire organization. Policies, procedures, and tools may be established at any tier; however, when established at Tiers 1 or 2, they facilitate the consistent implementation of ISCM across the organization and better support data reuse and judicious use of resources. Data collection, analysis, and reporting are automated where possible. Through the use of automation, it is possible to monitor a greater number of security metrics with fewer resources, higher frequencies, larger sample sizes, and with greater consistency and reliability than is feasible using manual processes. Organizations regularly review the ISCM strategy to ensure that metrics continue to be relevant, meaningful, actionable, and supportive of risk management decisions made by organizational officials at all tiers.",

At this tier, the criteria for ISCM are defined by the organization's risk management strategy, including how the organization plans to assess, respond to, and monitor risk, and the oversight required to ensure that the risk management strategy is effective. Security controls, security status, and other metrics defined and monitored by officials at this tier are designed to deliver information necessary to make risk management decisions in support of governance. Tier 1 metrics are developed for supporting governance decisions regarding the organization, its core missions, and its business functions. Tier 1 metrics may be calculated based on security-related information from common, hybrid, and system-specific security controls. The metrics and the frequency with which they are monitored and reported are determined by requirements to maintain operations within organizational risk tolerances. As part of the overall governance structure established by the organization, the Tier 1 risk management strategy and the associated monitoring requirements are communicated throughout Tiers 2 and 3.\n\n## 2.1.2 TIER 2 - MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESSES",
  "## 2.1.2 TIER 2 - MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESSES\n\nOrganizational officials that are accountable for one or more missions or business processes are also responsible for overseeing the associated risk management activities for those processes. The Tier 2 criteria for continuous monitoring of information security are defined by how core mission/business processes are prioritized with respect to the overall goals and# Objectives of the Organization\n\nThe objectives of the organization, the types of information needed to successfully execute the stated mission/business processes, and the organization-wide information security program strategy.\n\n## Program Management (PM) Family\n\nControls in the Program Management (PM) family are an example of Tier 2 security controls. These controls address the establishment and management of the organization's information security program. Tier 2 controls are deployed organization-wide and support all information systems. They may be tracked at Tier 2 or Tier 1. The frequencies with which Tier 2 security controls are assessed and security status and other metrics are monitored are determined in part by the objectives and priorities of the mission or business process and measurement capabilities inherent in the infrastructure. Security-related information may come from common, hybrid, and system-specific controls. Metrics and dashboards can be useful at Tiers 1 and 2 in assessing, normalizing, communicating, and correlating monitoring activities below the mission/business processes tier in a meaningful manner.\n\n### 2.1.3 Tier 3 - Information Systems\n\nISCM activities at Tier 3 address risk management from an information system perspective. These activities include ensuring that all system-level security controls (technical, operational, and management controls) are implemented correctly, operate as intended, produce the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system, and continue to be effective over time. ISCM activities at Tier 3 also include assessing and monitoring hybrid and common controls implemented at the system level. Security status reporting at this tier often includes but is not limited to security alerts, security incidents, and identified threat activities.",

Security status reporting at this tier often includes but is not limited to security alerts, security incidents, and identified threat activities.\n\nThe ISCM strategy for Tier 3 also ensures that security-related information supports the monitoring requirements of other organizational tiers. Data feeds/assessment results from system-level controls (system-specific, hybrid, or common), along with associated security status reporting, support risk-based decisions at the organization and mission/business processes tiers. Information is tailored for each tier and delivered in ways that inform risk-based decision making at all tiers. Those resulting decisions impact the ISCM strategy applied at the information systems tier. ISCM metrics originating at the information systems tier can be used to assess, respond, and monitor risk across the organization. The ongoing monitoring activities implemented at the information systems tier provide security-related information to authorizing officials (AOs) in support of ongoing system authorization decisions and to the risk executive (function) in support of ongoing organizational risk management.\n\nAt Tier 3, RMF Step 6 Monitor activities and ISCM activities are closely aligned.

Ongoing assessment of security control effectiveness supports a system's security authorization over time in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business processes. Through ISCM, new threat or vulnerability information is evaluated as it becomes available, permitting organizations to make adjustments to security requirements or individual controls as needed to maintain authorization decisions. The process for obtaining system authorization, and more generally, for managing information security and information system-related risk, is the RMF.\n\nThe RMF, illustrated in Figure 2-2, provides a disciplined and structured process that integrates information system security and risk management activities into the SDLC. The monitoring step (Step 6) of the RMF includes interactions between the three tiers as illustrated in the organizational view of ISCM in Figure 2-1. Interaction between the tiers includes data from system owners, common control providers, and authorizing officials on security control assessments and ongoing authorization of system and common controls provided to the risk executive (function). There is also dissemination of updated risk-related information such as vulnerability and threat data and organizational risk tolerance from Tiers 1 and 2 to authorizing officials and information system owners.",

The output of a strategically designed and well-managed organization-wide ISCM program can be used to maintain a system's authorization to operate and keep required system information and data (i.e., System Security Plan together with Risk Assessment Report, Security Assessment Report, and POA&M) up to date on an ongoing basis. Security management and reporting tools may provide functionality to automate updates to key evidence needed for ongoing authorization.# Decisions\n\nISCM also facilitates risk-based decision making regarding the ongoing authorization to operate information systems and security authorization for common controls by providing evolving threat activity or vulnerability information on demand. A security control assessment and risk determination process, otherwise static between authorizations, is thus transformed into a dynamic process that supports timely risk response actions and cost-effective, ongoing authorizations. Continuous monitoring of threats, vulnerabilities, and security control effectiveness provides situational awareness for risk-based support of ongoing authorization decisions. An appropriately designed ISCM strategy and program supports ongoing authorization of type authorizations, as well as single, joint, and leveraged authorizations.\n\n## ISCM in Support of Ongoing Assessment and Authorization",

An appropriately designed ISCM strategy and program supports ongoing authorization of type authorizations, as well as single, joint, and leveraged authorizations.\n\n## ISCM in Support of Ongoing Assessment and Authorization\n\nISCM in support of ongoing assessment and authorization has the potential to be resource-intensive and time-consuming. It is impractical to collect security-related information and assess every aspect of every security control deployed across an organization at all times. A more practical approach is to establish reasonable assessment frequencies for collecting security-related information. The frequency of assessments should be sufficient to assure adequate security commensurate with risk, as determined by system categorization and ISCM strategy requirements. Sampling of information system security objects, rather than 100 percent inspection, can also be an efficient and effective means of monitoring, particularly in cases where monitoring is not automated. Important considerations in determining sample sizes and monitoring frequencies are discussed in Chapter Three.\n\nMonitoring frequencies (e.g., annually, quarterly, monthly, daily) are not static, and they are not uniform across all metrics. Security control assessment and monitoring frequencies, for example, are adjusted to support changes in organizational information systems or their environments of operation, including emerging information on security threats and vulnerabilities. The priorities for ISCM vary and are adjusted in response to security incidents, to identify problems with security control implementations, or to evaluate changes to systems and system components that are determined to have a significant impact on security. An ISCM strategy can deliver dynamic updates of security-related data to support system authorizations conducted at any interval. Section 3.2.2 includes a more complete discussion of factors to consider when determining monitoring frequencies.\n\n## 2.3 Role of Automation in ISCM",

Section 3.2.2 includes a more complete discussion of factors to consider when determining monitoring frequencies.\n\n## 2.3 Role of Automation in ISCM\n\nWhen possible, organizations look for automated solutions to lower costs, enhance efficiency, and improve the reliability of monitoring security-related information. Security is implemented through a combination of people, processes, and technology. The automation of information security deals primarily with automating aspects of security that require little human interaction. Automated tools are often able to recognize patterns and relationships that may escape the notice.# Automation in Security Processes\n\nof human analysts, especially when the analysis is performed on large volumes of data. This includes items such as verifying technical settings on individual network endpoints or ensuring that the software on a machine is up to date with organizational policy. Automation serves to augment the security processes conducted by security professionals within an organization and may reduce the amount of time a security professional must spend on doing redundant tasks, thereby increasing the amount of time the trained professional may spend on tasks requiring human cognition.\n\n## ISCM Strategy\n\nThe ISCM strategy does not focus solely on the security-related information that is easy for an organization to collect or easy to automate. When an ISCM program is first implemented, there will likely be several aspects of the organization's security program that are manually monitored. Organizations' monitoring capabilities will expand and mature over time. Metrics will evolve with lessons learned and with increased insight into organizational security status and risk tolerance. The focus of an ISCM strategy is to provide adequate information about security control effectiveness and organizational security status allowing organizational officials to make informed, timely security risk management decisions. Thus, implementation, effectiveness, and adequacy of all security controls are monitored along with organizational security status.\n\n## Automation Considerations",
  "## ISCM Strategy\n\nThe ISCM strategy does not focus solely on the security-related information that is easy for an organization to collect or easy to automate.

Organizations' monitoring capabilities will expand and mature over time. Metrics will evolve with lessons learned and with increased insight into organizational security status and risk tolerance. The focus of an ISCM strategy is to provide adequate information about security control effectiveness and organizational security status allowing organizational officials to make informed, timely security risk management decisions. Thus, implementation, effectiveness, and adequacy of all security controls are monitored along with organizational security status.\n\n## Automation Considerations\n\nWhen determining the extent to which the organization automates ISCM, organizations consider potential efficiencies of process standardization that may be gained with automation, and the potential value (or lack of value) of the automated security-related information from a risk management perspective. Additionally, organizations consider intangibles such as the potential value of personnel reassignment and more comprehensive situational awareness.\n\nWhile automation of IT security has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of time a human must spend doing certain tasks, it is not possible to fully automate all of an organization's information security program functions. The technologies discussed in Appendix D, for example, still require human analysis for implementation and maintenance of the tools as well as appropriate interpretation of findings. Similarly, these tools operate within the context of processes designed, run, and maintained by humans. If individuals carry out their responsibilities insecurely, then the effectiveness of the technologies is compromised, and the security of the systems and the mission/business or organizational processes supported by those systems is put in jeopardy.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAutomation makes security-related information readily available in an environment where ongoing monitoring needs change. Therefore, during security control implementation (RMF Step 3), consideration is given to the capabilities inherent in available technology to support ISCM as part of the criteria in determining how best to implement a given control.# Consideration of ISCM Tools\n\nConsideration is given to ISCM tools that:",

It can therefore make comprehensive, ongoing control of information security practical and affordable. How effective the organization is in utilizing the monitoring results (obtained in a manual or automated fashion) still depends upon the organizational ISCM strategy, including validity and comprehensiveness of the metrics, as well as the processes in place to analyze monitoring results and respond to findings. Technologies for enabling automation of some ISCM tasks are discussed in greater detail in Appendix D.\n\n## 2.4 ISCM Roles and Responsibilities\n\nThis section describes the roles and responsibilities of key participants involved in an organization's ISCM program.

It also incorporates processes to assure that response actions are taken. An organization's strategy for action based on the data collected is as important (if not more important) than collecting the data. The process for developing an ISCM strategy and implementing an ISCM program is as follows:\n\n- Define an ISCM strategy based on risk tolerance that maintains clear visibility into assets, awareness of vulnerabilities, up-to-date threat information, and mission/business impacts.\n- Establish an ISCM program determining metrics, status monitoring frequencies, control assessment frequencies, and an ISCM technical architecture.\n```# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n- Implement an ISCM program and collect the security-related information required for metrics, assessments, and reporting.

Roles and responsibilities will vary across organizations as will implementation-level details of an ISCM program.\n\n## 3.1 DEFINE ISCM STRATEGY\n\nEffective ISCM begins with development of a strategy that addresses ISCM requirements and activities at each organizational tier (organization, mission/business processes, and information systems). Each tier monitors security metrics and assesses security control effectiveness with established monitoring and assessment frequencies and status reports customized to support tier-specific decision making. Policies, procedures, tools, and templates that are implemented from Tiers 1 and 2, or that are managed in accordance with guidance from Tiers 1 and 2, best support shared use of data within and across tiers. The lower tiers may require information in addition to that required at higher tiers and hence develop tier-specific strategies that are consistent with those at higher tiers and still sufficient to address local tier requirements for decision making. Depending on the organization, there may be overlap in the tasks and activities conducted at each tier.\n\nThe guidelines below, though not prescriptive, help to ensure an organization-wide approach to ISCM that best promotes standardized methodologies and consistent practices and hence maximizes efficiencies and leverageability of security-related data. As changes# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\noccur, the ISCM strategy is reviewed for relevance, accuracy in reflecting organizational risk tolerances, correctness of measurements, and applicability of metrics. An inherent part of any ISCM strategy is the inclusion of criteria describing the conditions that trigger a review or update of the strategy, in addition to the preestablished frequency audit. Likewise, the organization defines criteria and procedures for updating the ISCM program based on the revised ISCM strategy.\n\n## 3.1.1 ORGANIZATION (TIER 1) AND MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESSES (TIER 2) ISCM STRATEGY",

A risk with sampling is that the sample population may fail to capture the variations in assessment outcomes that would be obtained from an assessment of the full population. This could result in an inaccurate view of security control effectiveness and organizational security status.\n\nNIST SP 800-53A, as amended, describes how to achieve satisfactory coverage when determining sample populations for the three named assessment methods: examine, interview, and test. The guidelines in NIST SP 800-53A for basic, focused, and comprehensive testing addresses the need for a \"representative sample of assessment objects\" or a \"sufficiently large sample of assessment objects.\" Statistical tools can be used to help quantify sample size.\n\nNIST 800-53A provides guidelines to help address the general issue of sampling and particularly that of coverage. In selecting a sample population, the coverage attribute is satisfied through consideration of three criteria:\n\n- **Types of objects** - ensure sufficient diversity of types of assessment objects;\n- **Number of each type** - chose \"enough\" objects of each type to provide confidence that assessment of additional objects will result in consistent findings; and\n- **Specific objects per type assessed** - given all of the objects of relevance throughout the organization that could be assessed, include \"enough\" objects per type in the sample population to sufficiently account for the known or anticipated variance in assessment outcomes.\n\nSample measurements are summarized into a statistic (e.g., sample mean) and the observed value compared with the allowable value as represented by organizational risk tolerance. Statistics calculated using sampling can become less reliable predictors of the full population if the population is not randomly selected and if the sample size (i.e., objects to be tested) is small.

The program is sufficient to inform risk-based decisions and maintain operations within established risk tolerances. Goals include detection of anomalies and changes in the organization's environments of operation and information systems, visibility into assets, awareness of vulnerabilities, knowledge of threats, security control effectiveness, and security status including compliance. Metrics are designed and frequencies determined to ensure that information needed to manage risk to within organizational risk tolerances is available. Tools, technologies, and manual and/or automated methodologies are implemented within the context of an architecture designed to deliver the required information in the appropriate context and at the right frequencies.\n\n### 3.2.1 DETERMINE METRICS\nOrganizations determine metrics to be used to evaluate and control ongoing risk to the organization. Metrics, which include all the security-related information from assessments and monitoring produced by automated tools and manual procedures, are organized into meaningful information to support decision making and reporting requirements. Metrics should be derived from specific objectives that will maintain or improve security posture. Metrics are developed for system-level data to make it meaningful in the context of mission/business or organizational risk management.\n\nMetrics may use security-related information acquired at different frequencies and therefore with varying data latencies. Metrics may be calculated from a combination of security status monitoring, security control assessment data, and from data collected from one or more security controls.

Metrics are defined or calculated in accordance with output from the security architecture. Collecting metrics from a security architecture with security controls that have not been assessed is equivalent to using a broken or uncalibrated scale. The interpretation of metrics data presumes that controls directly and indirectly used in the metric calculation are implemented and working as anticipated. If a metric indicates a problem, the root cause could be any number of things. Without fundamental assurance of correct implementation and continued effectiveness of security controls that are not associated with the metric, the root cause analysis is going to be hampered, and the analysis may be inappropriately narrowed to a predetermined list, overlooking the true problem.

For some organizations, dashboards and ongoing assessments are a shift away from the model of complete security control assessments conducted at a distinct point in time. For this shift to be constructive and effective from security, assurance, and resource use perspectives, organizations determine the frequencies with which each security control or control element is assessed for effectiveness and the frequencies with which each metric is monitored.\n\nSecurity control effectiveness across a tier or throughout the organization can itself be taken as a security metric and as such may have an associated status monitoring frequency. Though monitoring and assessment frequencies are determined for each individual metric and control, organizations use this data of different latencies to create a holistic view of the security of each system as well as a view of the security of the enterprise architecture. As the monitoring program matures, monitoring and assessment frequencies are important in the context of how the data is used and the question \"When did the system receive authorization to operate?\" will become less meaningful than \"How resilient is the system?\"\n\n## Considerations in Determining Assessment and Monitoring Frequencies\n\nOrganizations take the following criteria into consideration when establishing monitoring frequencies for metrics or assessment frequencies for security controls:",

As the monitoring program matures, monitoring and assessment frequencies are important in the context of how the data is used and the question \"When did the system receive authorization to operate?\" will become less meaningful than \"How resilient is the system?\"\n\n## Considerations in Determining Assessment and Monitoring Frequencies\n\nOrganizations take the following criteria into consideration when establishing monitoring frequencies for metrics or assessment frequencies for security controls:\n\n- **Security control volatility.** Volatile security controls are assessed more frequently, whether the objective is establishing security control effectiveness or supporting calculation of a metric. Controls in the NIST SP 800-53 Configuration Management (CM) family are a good example of volatile controls. Information system configurations typically experience high rates of change. Unauthorized or unanalyzed changes in the system configuration often render the system vulnerable to exploits. Therefore, corresponding controls such as CM-6, Configuration Settings, and CM-8, Information System Component Inventory, may require more frequent assessment and monitoring, preferably using automated, SCAP-validated tools that provide alerts and status on demand. Conversely, controls such as PS-2, Position Categorization, or PS-3, Personnel Screening, (from the NIST SP 800-53 Personnel Security family of controls) are not volatile in most organizational settings. They tend to remain static over long periods and would therefore typically require less frequent assessment.\n\n- **System categorizations/impact levels.** In general, security controls implemented on systems that are categorized as high-impact are monitored more frequently than controls implemented on moderate-impact systems, which are in turn monitored more frequently than controls implemented on low-impact systems.\n\n- **Security controls or specific assessment objects providing critical functions.** Security```markdown\n# Monitoring Considerations\n\n## Critical Security Functions\nControls or assessment objects that provide critical security functions (e.g., log management server, firewalls) are candidates for more frequent monitoring. Additionally, individual assessment objects that support critical security functions and/or are deemed critical to the system (in accordance with the Business Impact Analysis) or to the organization may be candidates for more frequent monitoring.",
  "- **System categorizations/impact levels.** In general, security controls implemented on systems that are categorized as high-impact are monitored more frequently than controls implemented on moderate-impact systems, which are in turn monitored more frequently than controls implemented on low-impact systems.\n\n- **Security controls or specific assessment objects providing critical functions.** Security```markdown\n# Monitoring Considerations\n\n## Critical Security Functions\nControls or assessment objects that provide critical security functions (e.g., log management server, firewalls) are candidates for more frequent monitoring. Additionally, individual assessment objects that support critical security functions and/or are deemed critical to the system (in accordance with the Business Impact Analysis) or to the organization may be candidates for more frequent monitoring.\n\n## Security Controls with Identified Weaknesses\nSecurity controls with identified weaknesses. Existing risks documented in security assessment reports (SARs) are considered for more frequent monitoring to ensure that risks stay within tolerance. Similarly, controls documented in the POA&M as having weaknesses are monitored more frequently until remediation of the weakness is complete. Note that not all weaknesses require the same level of monitoring. For example, weaknesses deemed in the SAR to be of minor or low-impact risk to the system or organization are monitored less frequently than a weakness with a higher-impact risk to the system or organization.\n\n## Organizational Risk Tolerance\nOrganizational risk tolerance. Organizations with a low tolerance for risk (e.g., organizations that process, store, or transmit large amounts of proprietary and/or personally identifiable information (PII), organizations with numerous high-impact systems, organizations facing specific persistent threats) monitor more frequently than organizations with a higher tolerance for risk (e.g., organizations with primarily low- and moderate-impact systems that process, store, or transmit very little PII and/or proprietary information).\n\n## Threat Information\nThreat information. Organizations consider current credible threat information, including known exploits and attack patterns, when establishing monitoring frequencies. For instance, if a specific attack is developed which exploits a vulnerability of an implemented technology, temporary or permanent increases to the monitoring frequencies for related controls or metrics may help provide protection from the threat.\n\n## Vulnerability Information\nVulnerability information. Organizations consider current vulnerability information with respect to information technology products when establishing monitoring frequencies. For instance, if a specific product manufacturer provides software patches monthly, an organization might consider conducting vulnerability scans on that product at least that often.",

Organizations consider current vulnerability information with respect to information technology products when establishing monitoring frequencies. For instance, if a specific product manufacturer provides software patches monthly, an organization might consider conducting vulnerability scans on that product at least that often.\n\n## Risk Assessment Results\nRisk assessment results. Results from organizational and/or system-specific assessments of risk (either formal or informal) are examined and taken into consideration when establishing monitoring frequencies. For instance, if a system-specific risk assessment identifies potential threats and vulnerabilities related to nonlocal maintenance (NIST SP 800-53, MA-4), the organization considers more frequent monitoring of the records kept on nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities. If a risk scoring scheme is in place at the organization, the risk scores may be used as justification to increase or decrease the monitoring.\n```# Frequencies of Related Controls\n\n- **Output of monitoring strategy reviews.** Review and adjustment of the monitoring strategy is covered in detail in Section 3.6.\n- **Reporting requirements.** Reporting requirements do not drive the ISCM strategy but may play a role in the frequency of monitoring. For instance, if OMB policy requires quarterly reports on the number of unauthorized components detected and corrective actions taken, the organization would monitor the system for unauthorized components at least quarterly. Organizations focus on obtaining the data required at the determined frequencies and deploy their human and capital resources accordingly. As automation capability or resources are added, organizations may consider increasing affected monitoring frequencies. Similarly, if resource availability decreases, the organization considers adjusting affected monitoring frequencies to ensure that security-related information is appropriately analyzed while continuing to meet organizational risk management requirements.",

Similarly, if resource availability decreases, the organization considers adjusting affected monitoring frequencies to ensure that security-related information is appropriately analyzed while continuing to meet organizational risk management requirements.\n\nMany security controls in the NIST SP 800-53 catalog have multiple implementation requirements along with control enhancements that may also have multiple implementation requirements. It may be necessary to assess or monitor individual control requirements and/or control enhancements within a given control with differing frequencies. For instance, the control AC-2, Account Management, has ten separate requirements (a. through j.) within the base control and four control enhancements [(1) through (4)]. The monitoring frequency may vary for each requirement in accordance with the considerations discussed. For example, AC-2a involves the identification of account types. For a typical information system, once the account types have been identified and documented, they are not likely to change very often. For this reason, AC-2a is a candidate for relatively infrequent assessment. AC-2h involves the deactivation of temporary accounts and accounts of terminated or transferred users. Since personnel regularly come and go, a typical organization would most likely assess AC-2h on a more frequent basis than AC-2a. AC-2 (3) requires that the system automatically disable accounts after a specified time period of inactivity. As an automated control and one with typically high volatility, AC-2 (3) is a candidate for relatively frequent monitoring and also may serve to automate some of the base control requirements so that they can be monitored more frequently in accordance with the organizational ISCM strategy.\n\n## Organization and Mission/Business Processes Tiers",
  "## Organization and Mission/Business Processes Tiers\n\nAt the mission/business processes tier, the organization establishes the minimum frequency with which each security control or metric is to be assessed or monitored.

Common controls are often inherited by a large number of organizational systems. The aggregate criticality of such controls may require more frequent assessments than would similar controls responsible for protecting a single system. Additionally, determining the frequency for assessing common controls includes the organization's determination of the trustworthiness of the common control provider. Common controls that are process-related (e.g., procedures/templates, PM controls) do not tend to be volatile and typically do not lend themselves well to automation. Still, the organization considers the volatility of such controls as well as related threat information when establishing assessment frequencies.\n\n### Primary Roles:\n- Chief Information Officer\n- Senior Information Security Officer\n\n### Supporting Roles:\n- Risk Executive (Function)\n- Authorizing Officials\n- Common Control Provider\n- Information System Owner\n\n### Expected Input:\n- Organizational risk assessment\n- Organizational risk tolerance\n- Current threat information\n- Reporting requirements\n- Current vulnerability information\n- Output from monitoring strategy reviews\n\n### Expected Output:\n- Organization-wide policies and procedures\n- Recommended frequencies with which each security control and metric is assessed or monitored\n\n## Information Systems Tier\nAt the information systems tier, system owners review the minimum monitoring/assessment frequencies established by organization and/or mission/business processes tier policy and determine if the minimum frequencies are adequate for a given information system.

The core requirements of an architecture implemented to support ISCM are data collection, data storage, data analysis capabilities, and retrieval and presentation (reporting) capabilities. Methodologies are standardized to facilitate efficiencies, intra- and inter-tier information exchange, correlation, and other analysis.\n\nOrganizations use automated tools, technologies, and methodologies where appropriate to allow for increased efficiencies and insight including those gained through collection, analysis and dissemination of large volumes of data from diverse sources. The architecture and associated policies and procedures are designed to minimize data calls and maximize data reuse.

Interoperable data specifications (e.g., SCAP, XML) enable data to be collected once and reused many times.

  "Organizations use automated tools, technologies, and methodologies where appropriate to allow for increased efficiencies and insight including those gained through collection, analysis and dissemination of large volumes of data from diverse sources. The architecture and associated policies and procedures are designed to minimize data calls and maximize data reuse.

Security-related information (data) is collected as required for predefined metrics, security control assessments are conducted, and the security-related information generated is reported in accordance with organizational policies and procedures. All security control classes (management, operational, and technical) and types (common, hybrid, and system-specific) are included in the organizational continuous monitoring program. Every control is monitored for effectiveness, and every control is subject to use in monitoring security status. Data sources include people, processes, technologies, the computing environment, as well as any existing relevant security control assessment reports.\n\nCollection, analysis, and reporting of data are automated where possible. Whether manual or automated, the data collected is assembled for analysis and reported to the organizational officials charged with correlating and analyzing it in ways that are relevant for risk management activities. As indicated in the examples above, this may mean taking data from a variety of sources, collected at various points in time, and combining it in ways that are meaningful for the official receiving it at the time that it is requested. Part of the implementation stage of the continuous monitoring process is effectively organizing and delivering ISCM data to stakeholders in accordance with decision-making requirements. Tools and methodologies are chosen for the organization-wide ISCM architecture, in order to help ensure that risk-based decisions are informed by accurate, current security-related information.",

Organizations also use ISCM data to inform processes that are not primarily used to control information security risk. Similarly, data from those processes can also be used to inform the ISCM program. Examples of processes that inform and are informed by ISCM include, but are not limited to, patch management, asset management, license management, configuration management, vulnerability management, and system authorization.\n\nAs described in Chapter Two, the ISCM data output from one process may serve as input to many others.\n\n### Primary Roles\n\n- Information System Owner\n- Common Control Provider\n- Information System Security Officer\n- Security Control Assessor\n\n### Supporting Roles\n\n- Risk Executive (Function)\n- Authorizing Official\n- Chief Information Officer\n- Senior Information Security Officer\n\n### Expected Input\n\nOrganizational- and system-level policies and procedures on ISCM```markdown\n# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Strategy\nMetrics, the Security Assessment Plan updated with assessment and monitoring frequencies, and automation specifications.\n\n### Expected Outputs\nSecurity-related information.\n\n## 3.4 Analyze Data and Report Findings\nOrganizations develop procedures for analyzing and reporting assessment and monitoring results.

It may be necessary to collect additional data to supplement or clarify security-related information under analysis. The information to be analyzed is provided to organizational officials in a variety of ways, such as recurring reports, automated reports, ad hoc reports, data feeds, and database views. Security-related information resulting from ISCM is analyzed in the context of stated risk tolerances, the potential impact that vulnerabilities may have on information systems, mission/business processes, and organization as a whole, and the potential impact of mitigation options. Even with real-time or near real-time organization-specific and system-specific security-related information, evolving vulnerability and threat data is always considered during the analysis. Organizational officials review the analyzed reports to determine whether to conduct mitigation activities or to transfer, avoid/reject, or accept risk. In some cases, authorizing officials may determine that accepting some specific risk is preferable to implementing a mitigating response. The rationale for such determinations may include organizational risk tolerance, negative impact to mission/business processes, or cost-effectiveness/return on investment of the implementation. Resolution of risk and the rationale for the decision is recorded in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.\n\n#### Primary Roles\n- Risk Executive (Function)\n- Chief Information Officer\n- Senior Information Security Officer\n- Authorization Officials\n- Security Control Assessors\n\n#### Supporting Roles\n- Information System Owners\n- Common Control Providers\n- System Security Officers",

Security-related information from assessments may be conveyed in templates or spreadsheets or collected and reported in an automated fashion. At the system level, security-related information from assessments directly supports ongoing authorization decisions and plans of action and milestones creation and tracking. Some security controls or elements of security controls, by definition, are security metrics (e.g., SI-4 Information System Monitoring). Hence, assessing the effectiveness of these controls results in monitoring the security status of the related metric.\n\nStaff report assessment results in accordance with organizational policies and procedures. Reporting on additional metrics and/or assessment results may be required by higher-level organizations such as OMB. Organizations define security status reporting requirements in the ISCM strategy. This includes the specific staff/roles to receive ISCM reports, the content and format of the reports, the frequency of reports, and any tools to be used.\n\nTier 3 officials report on findings, document any system-level mitigations made, and/or provide recommendations to officials at Tiers 1 and 2. Organizational officials at Tiers 1 and 2 review Tier 3 findings to determine aggregate security status and the effectiveness and adequacy of all controls in meeting mission/business and organizational information security requirements.",

For example, the risk executive (function) may receive a general report on all systems annually and a detailed report on specific high-impact systems quarterly. The reports provided to the CIO and SISO may contain more granular technical data on all systems quarterly, and the AO may receive monthly comprehensive reports on the systems for which s/he is responsible. The computer incident response team (CIRT) lead may receive exception reports when alerts are generated, and network administrators may review dashboards showing network activity that is updated every minute, with summary metrics that are updated hourly or daily. Organizations may consider more frequent reports for specific controls with more volatility or on controls for which there have been weaknesses or lack of compliance.\n\nOrganizations also define requirements for reporting results of controls, such as PM controls, that are not easily automated.

Response to findings at all tiers may include risk mitigation, risk acceptance, risk avoidance/rejection, or risk sharing/transfer, in accordance with organizational risk tolerance. Responses are coordinated with appropriate security management activities such as the security-focused configuration management program. At Tier 1, response to findings may result in changes to security policies around organizational governance. Tier 1's response may be constrained by the mission/business needs and the limitations of the enterprise architecture (including the human components), immutable governance policies, or other external drivers. At Tier 2, response to findings may include requests for additional security-related information, new or modified metrics, changes in mission/business processes, or Tier 3 reporting requirements, and/or additions or modifications to common control implementations. The Tier 2 response may be constrained by organizational governance policies and strategies as well as mission/business.```markdown\n# Goals and Objectives and Limitations of Organizational Resources and Infrastructure\n\nAt Tier 3, mitigation strategies have a direct and immediate impact on system-level risk and responses to findings may include implementation of additional controls, modifications to previously implemented controls, removal of systems' authorization to operate, changes to the frequency of monitoring, and/or additional or more detailed analysis of security-related information.

If any of the data collected is not required for reporting purposes or found to be not useful in maintaining or...\n```# Improving the Organization's Security Posture\n\nThen the organization considers saving resources by discontinuing that particular collection.

Similarly, status reports and metrics are analyzed to determine if there are any security trends that suggest changes to the monitoring strategy may be necessary.\n\nFor instance, if weekly assessments of component inventories over a six-month period indicate that very few changes are being made in a given week and changes that were made are accurately reflected in the inventories, the organization may wish to reduce the frequency of monitoring component inventories to biweekly or monthly. Conversely, if biweekly audit record analyses over a six-month period indicate increases in anomalous events, the organization may wish to increase the frequency of audit record reviews to weekly.\n\nAn organization's ISCM strategy also changes as the organization's security program(s) and monitoring capabilities mature. In a fully mature program, security-related information collection and analysis are accomplished using standardized methods across the organization, as an integral part of mission and business processes, and automated to the fullest extent possible. In this case, the security program is mature enough to ensure that sufficient processes and procedures effectively secure the enterprise architecture in accordance with organizational risk tolerances, and to collect, correlate, analyze, and report on relevant security metrics.\n\nISCM is a recursive process in the sense that the monitoring strategy is continually refined as the steps of the process repeat. Further, the organization-wide application of ISCM is accomplished through smaller or more narrowly focused instances of the similar efforts at the mission/business processes and systems tiers.
