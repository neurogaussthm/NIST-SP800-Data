An ISCM program assessment provides organizational leadership with information on the effectiveness and completeness of the organization's ISCM program, including the review of ISCM strategies, policies, procedures, operations, and analysis of continuous monitoring data. The ISCM assessment approach can be used as presented or as the starting point for an organization-specific methodology. It includes example evaluation criteria and assessment procedures that can be applied to organizations.\n\n# Executive Summary\nTo effectively manage cybersecurity risks, organizations require ongoing awareness of their information security posture, vulnerabilities, and threats. To achieve this awareness and better manage risks, organizations implement Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) capabilities under the direction of an ISCM program. An ISCM program defines, establishes, implements, and operates the various aspects of ISCM to provide the organization with the information necessary to make risk-based decisions regarding security status at all organizational risk management levels (organization level, mission and business process level, and system level).\n\nOrganizations need a way to determine and evaluate if an established ISCM program is effectively managing the organization's security posture commensurate with risk. This publication describes one approach to developing an ISCM program assessment based on evaluation criteria derived from multiple sources, (including NIST Special Publications (SP) 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, SP 800-37, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy, SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission and Information System View, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars and Memoranda). An ISCM program assessment developed under guidance in this publication evaluates the ISCM program itself (i.e., the structure and governance of the ISCM program), not the results of the ISCM program or the continuous monitoring technologies used. An effective ISCM program assessment provides consistent results regardless of the entity conducting the assessment. This publication does not prescribe the assessment of individual controls nor the examination of control assessment results as part of the ISCM program assessment.\n\nThe overarching goal of the ISCM program assessment is to provide organizations with\n```# Recommendations to Improve the ISCM Program",
  "The overarching goal of the ISCM program assessment is to provide organizations with\n```# Recommendations to Improve the ISCM Program\n\nRecommendations to improve the ISCM program and thereby manage and reduce organizational risk. An ISCM program assessment provides a means for evaluating an organization's ISCM strategies, policies, procedures, implementations, operational procedures, analytical processes, specific reporting, results presentation, risk assessment and risk scoring, risk response, and the ISCM program improvement process. An ISCM program assessment may be developed by an organization to evaluate its own ISCM program or by an independent assessment organization.\n\nCreating or adopting and using an ISCM program assessment can help reduce overall risk to organizations by identifying gaps in an ISCM program, in the implementation of an ISCM program, or in the operational use of ISCM results. In addition, an ISCM program assessment can indicate the level of readiness for system-level ongoing authorization.\n\n## This Publication:\n\n- Offers guidance on the development of an ISCM program assessment process for all organizational risk management levels, i.e., as defined in NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View;\n- Describes how an ISCM program assessment relates to important security concepts and processes, such as the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), organization-wide risk management levels, organizational governance, metrics applicable to ISCM, and ongoing authorization;\n- Describes the properties of an effective ISCM program assessment;\n- Presents a set of ISCM program assessment criteria, with references to the sources from which the criteria are derived, that can be adopted by an organization and used for ISCM program assessments or as a starting point for further development of an organization's assessment criteria; and\n- Defines a way to conduct ISCM program assessments by using assessment procedures defined in the companion document containing the ISCM Program Assessment Element Catalog and designed to produce a repeatable assessment process.\n\n## 1 Introduction",
  "## 1 Introduction\n\nUnder the Federal Information Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) [FISMA2014] and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars and Memoranda, federal agencies are directed to implement a program to continuously monitor organizational information security status. A comprehensive continuous monitoring program serves as a risk management and decision support tool used at each level of an organization. Strategies and business objectives at the organizational level direct activities needed at the mission and business levels as well as system level functions and technologies implemented in support of continuous monitoring.\n\nNIST Special Publication (SP) 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-137], defines information security continuous monitoring (ISCM) as maintaining ongoing awareness of information security.# Vulnerabilities and Threats to Support Organizational Risk Management Decisions\n\nAn ISCM program defines, establishes, implements, and operates the various aspects of ISCM to provide the organization with the information necessary to make risk-based decisions regarding security status at all three organizational risk management levels.\n\nTo effectively address increasing security challenges, the ISCM program:\n\n- Addresses the assessment of controls for effectiveness and security status monitoring;\n- Promotes the concept of near real-time risk management and ongoing system authorization through the implementation of robust, organization-wide continuous monitoring processes; and\n- Incorporates processes to ensure that response actions are taken in accordance with findings and organizational risk tolerances and that they have the intended effects.\n\nThis publication, NIST SP 800-137A, provides guidance on how an organization can assess ISCM program completeness and effectiveness, and detect deficiencies in its ISCM program. The goal of the ISCM program assessment is to provide a means for evaluating organizational ISCM program elements, including the review of ISCM strategies, policies, procedures, implementation planning, ISCM metrics, analytical processes, specific results presentation and reporting, risk response, and the ISCM improvement process. The approach used throughout this publication is based on the concepts and principles of [SP800-137] and the ISCM requirements mandated for federal organizations.\n\nThe term assessment is used in two ways in this publication. Assessment may refer to the completed action of ISCM program evaluation or to the vehicle that is reused for each evaluation (e.g., a template or blank worksheet). The context in which the term is used conveys the applicable meaning.\n\n## 1.1 Background",

An effective ISCM program produces timely, security-related information that is accurate and complete for presentation to decision makers at multiple levels of the organization.\n\nAt the organizational level, it may not be well understood how, where, or why the ISCM program fits into the organization-wide risk management strategy. It is crucial for the organization's leadership to understand how business needs and capabilities drive the ISCM program. In many cases, capabilities needed for organizational continuous monitoring may already exist within the organization. However, without a comprehensive strategy to formally codify monitoring capabilities as enabling ISCM functions, a true ISCM program does not exist.\n\nOrganizations need a method for evaluating what has been planned, developed, or acquired to implement ISCM, particularly if the ISCM program is developed internally. This helps determine...# ISCM Program Assessment\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhether the organization's ISCM program is adequate and if the investment is providing value. To determine the effectiveness of an organization's ISCM program, the organization develops and uses a formal assessment for evaluation that provides organizational leadership with information about how well the ISCM program meets its intended objectives.

An ISCM program assessment may also provide recommendations to the organization based on assessment results.",

An ISCM program assessment may be comprised of evaluation criteria, judgments, and scores about specific aspects of ISCM capabilities as well as conclusions based on an analysis of the collected data. An ISCM program assessment may also provide recommendations to the organization based on assessment results.\n\nUnder sponsorship of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and in conjunction with the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) at NIST, CISA initiated development of an ISCM program assessment process based primarily on [SP800-137], published by the NIST Computer Security Division (CSD). The assessment process, which is presented in more detail in the forthcoming NIST Interagency or Internal Report (NISTIR) 8212 [NISTIR8212], was developed for use by CISA and federal agencies. The ISCM program assessment process can be tailored for use by federal agencies, commercial organizations, and non-federal governmental organizations. Using [NISTIR8212] as a guide, an organization may choose to adopt the same approach to evaluating ISCM plans and solutions to supplement the guidance in NIST SP 800-137A.\n\n## 1.2 Purpose\n\nThis publication:\n\n- Provides guidance on the development of an ISCM program assessment for all organizational risk management levels;\n- Defines a methodology to conduct ISCM program assessments;\n- Presents a set of detailed ISCM program assessment criteria that can be adopted by an organization or assessing organization; and\n- Describes the properties of an effective ISCM program assessment.\n\nIn addition, the guidance presented in this publication can be used to produce an ISCM program assessment to:",

The assessment of individual controls and the examination of control assessment results is outside of the scope of the ISCM program assessment.\n\nThere are many ways to evaluate an organizational program or system against a set of criteria. This publication specifies one approach for developing assessments for doing so based on evaluation criteria derived from multiple sources. The ISCM program assessment evaluates the structure and governance of the ISCM program and does not evaluate the continuous monitoring technologies or implementations themselves. An assessment developed under the guidance provided herein is technology-neutral, flexible, and scalable to be easily adopted by any organization and applied to any type of security monitoring technology. Organizations are encouraged to use the approach specified in this publication as a starting point to develop an assessment to better meet specific organizational needs.\n\n## 1.5 Assumptions\nIt is assumed that the reader is familiar with the ISCM concepts described in [SP800-137] and has a working-level understanding of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) as defined and amended in [SP800-37].

  "## 2 The Fundamentals\n\nThis section explains the fundamentals of the ISCM program assessment, a management process that provides a view into the adequacy and effectiveness of the:\n\n- ISCM strategy and planning;\n- Establishment of the ISCM program;\n- Implementation of ISCM strategies, policies, procedures, and metrics;\n- Operation of the ISCM program;\n- Analysis of data collected and reporting of results;\n- Response to ISCM results; and\n- ISCM process improvement.\n\nThe fundamentals presented in this section are integrated into an assessment process in Section 3. The development process of the ISCM program assessment does not seek to evaluate the organization, its missions/business processes, and systems for every ISCM concept presented in [SP800-137]. Rather, the ISCM program assessment determines if the concepts, along with ISCM requirements levied on federal organizations by FISMA and OMB, are sufficiently addressed to permit a determination of ISCM program robustness. It should be noted that each organization or assessor developing an ISCM program assessment from the guidance in this publication is likely to produce different assessment criteria depending on what is important to the organization or assessor.\n\n### 2.1 ISCM Management\n\nISCM is an organization-wide responsibility first, then a system-level responsibility [SP800-37], which includes mission and business processes as well. Organization-wide continuous monitoring efforts begin with organizational leadership defining a comprehensive, organization-wide ISCM strategy that directly supports decision making within the risk executive function (RE(f)) and includes consistently managed metrics linked to each organizational risk management level. Only when an ISCM strategy is defined and adopted at the organizational level...# ISCM Program Overview\n\nLevel and intrinsically linked to the RE(f) can the ISCM program be established with the appropriate breadth and depth to provide all levels of the organization with clearly defined responsibilities. The organizational level strategy is supported by system-level ISCM strategies and, optionally, mission/business process ISCM strategies.\n\nISCM encompasses all of the people, policies, processes, technologies, and standards that are used to perform the continuous monitoring function. ISCM is an enabling process that supports or provides organizational sustainment in the face of cybersecurity threats and risks.",

ISCM is an enabling process that supports or provides organizational sustainment in the face of cybersecurity threats and risks.\n\nAn adequately developed ISCM program identifies the specific activities at each level of the organization that enable an organization-wide ISCM function. To effectively support the overall ISCM effort, ISCM activities are consistently developed, deployed, and sustained with explicit mapping to the ISCM strategic objectives and risk management strategy for the entire organization.\n\nThe following subsections summarize important ISCM concepts and introduce how the ISCM program assessment relates to each concept. For additional information on developing and implementing ISCM, see [SP800-137].\n\n## 2.1.1 ISCM Background\n\nISCM goals include detection of anomalies and changes in the organization's environments of operation and systems, visibility into assets, awareness of vulnerabilities and threats, knowledge of security control effectiveness, and security posture. To meet ISCM goals, tools, technologies, and manual and automated methods are implemented within the context of an ISCM architecture designed to deliver the required information in the appropriate context, at the right level of detail, and at the right frequencies. The key outcome of the ISCM program is to enable the collection, integration, analysis, and presentation of security-related information from all systems and their environments of operation across the organization to inform risk-based decision making.\n\nAn effective ISCM program identifies manual and automated monitoring processes in the organization-wide ISCM strategy, integrates the processes and associated outputs, and incorporates results into a view of situational awareness. Where manual processes are used, the processes are verified so that they are repeatable and enable a consistent implementation. Automated processes, including the use of automated support tools, can make continuous monitoring more consistent, efficient, accurate, and cost-effective.",
  "An effective ISCM program identifies manual and automated monitoring processes in the organization-wide ISCM strategy, integrates the processes and associated outputs, and incorporates results into a view of situational awareness. Where manual processes are used, the processes are verified so that they are repeatable and enable a consistent implementation. Automated processes, including the use of automated support tools, can make continuous monitoring more consistent, efficient, accurate, and cost-effective.\n\nAn effective ISCM program facilitates ongoing authorization and reauthorization decisions for systems [SP800-37], as discussed in Section 2.1.7. Security-related information collected during continuous monitoring is used to make updates to the authorization package and supporting artifacts for each applicable system. Updated artifacts provide evidence that the baseline controls continue to safeguard the system as originally planned.# 2.1.2 ISCM Process Steps\n\nNIST SP 800-137 organizes the ISCM process into six steps, as depicted in Figure 1 and explained below. It is important to note that any effort or process intended to support ongoing monitoring of information security across an organization begins with the development of a comprehensive ISCM strategy that encompasses technologies, processes, procedures, operating environments, and people.\n\nThe six ISCM steps are referred to as \"process steps\" in this publication and are:\n\n1. **Define ISCM Strategy (Define)** \u2013 Define the organization-wide and system-level ISCM strategies, based on organizational risk tolerance, that maintain clear visibility into assets, awareness of vulnerabilities, up-to-date threat information, and mission/business impacts. A system-level ISCM strategy consistent with the organization-wide ISCM strategy is defined for each system within the organization. A mission/business process area may also define an ISCM strategy that is consistent with the organization-wide strategy and applies to the systems supporting the mission/business process area.\n\n2. **Establish ISCM Program (Establish)** \u2013 Establish an ISCM program, determining metrics, status monitoring frequencies, control assessment frequencies, and an ISCM technical architecture.\n\n3. **Implement ISCM Program (Implement)** \u2013 Implement the ISCM program and collect the security-related information required for metrics, assessments, and reporting. Automate collection, analysis, and reporting of data where possible.\n\n4. **Analyze ISCM Data and Report Findings (Analyze/Report)** \u2013 Analyze the data collected, report findings, and determine the appropriate response. It may be necessary to collect additional information to clarify or supplement existing monitoring data.",

The organization-wide and optional mission/business process ISCM strategies are addressed in the RMF Prepare step for Level 1 and Level 2, and the system-level ISCM strategy is addressed in the RMF Select step for Level 3 (see [SP800-37]).\n\n# 2.1.3 Organization-Wide Risk Management Levels\n\nISCM applies to all three organizational risk management levels defined in [SP800-39]:\n\n- **Level 1 (organization level)** addresses risk across the entire organization and informs Levels 2 and 3 of risk context and risk decisions made at Level 1.\n- **Level 2 (mission or business process level)** addresses risk from a...# Mission/Business Process Perspective\n\nThe mission/business process perspective is informed by risk context, risk decisions, and risk activities at Level 1.\n\n## Level 3",

Implementation of the ISCM program may rely on artifacts and processes implemented as part of the RMF and also provides input to the RMF steps to understand and manage risk. The assessment approach and assessment elements address any potential overlap and/or relationships.\n\nThe RMF Monitor step describes continuous monitoring, which is a critical part of the risk management process. Organizational continuous monitoring requirements can be met through implementation of ISCM, and ISCM can provide results that are used in the identification of and risk response. In addition, an organization's overall security architecture and accompanying security program are monitored through ISCM to ensure that organization-wide operations remain within an acceptable level of risk, despite any changes that occur. Timely, relevant, and accurate security-related information is vital, particularly when resources are limited and organizations must prioritize their efforts.\n\nAt Level 3, the RMF Monitor step and ISCM activities are closely aligned. The assessment methods relevant for implemented controls are the same, whether the assessments are performed solely in support of system authorization (the RMF Authorize step) or in support of a broader, more comprehensive continuous monitoring effort. System-level officials and staff conduct assessments and monitoring, analyzing results on an ongoing basis. The information obtained is leveraged at the organization, mission/business processes, and system levels to support risk management.\n\nAlthough frequency requirements may differ, each organizational level receives the benefit of security-related information that is current and applicable to affected processes.

The ISCM program assessment verifies that applicable ISCM results, which may include relevant metrics, are made available to the OA process to make decisions about system authorization. OA is discussed in Section 2.1.7.\n\n## 2.1.5 Governance and ISCM\n\nISCM governance is part of overall organizational governance, which provides oversight to organizations by specifying authorities, responsibilities, accountability, and governing processes and procedures that facilitate implementation, enforcement, and continuous improvement of the ISCM governing processes. Governance, including ISCM governance, establishes lines of accountability throughout the organization at all risk-management levels. ISCM governance is a conceptual organizing and planning structure for managing risk. It is linked to one or more senior officials or staff, such as the RE(f) or other accountable senior official (e.g., senior accountable official for risk management, senior agency information security officer [SAISO], senior agency official for privacy, and chief information officer [CIO]). The part of information security governance structure that addresses ISCM is aligned with other governance structures to ensure compatibility with established management practices within the organization and to increase overall effectiveness.\n\nThe ISCM program assessment verifies that ISCM governance policies and processes exist and are being followed. At Level 1, an assessment verifies that senior leaders recognize the importance of managing information security risk and establish appropriate governance structures relative to ISCM for managing such risk. The organization-wide ISCM strategy captures the ISCM governance structures.",

At Level 1, an assessment verifies that senior leaders recognize the importance of managing information security risk and establish appropriate governance structures relative to ISCM for managing such risk. The organization-wide ISCM strategy captures the ISCM governance structures.\n\nWhere the organization has decentralized governance (e.g., because of divergent mission or business needs or operating environments), mission/business process areas (Level 2)\u2014while remaining consistent with the organization-wide ISCM strategy\u2014may establish their own ISCM policies and processes, in whole or in part, particularly as they relate to risk management and information security decisions. With the decentralized governance model, it is important that the different levels of the organization share ISCM information as it relates to risk management decisions.\n\n## 2.1.6 ISCM Metrics\n\nMetrics determined through ISCM provide important information about the security posture across the organization and relative to individual systems and inform the risk management process. See [SP800-137] for more information on ISCM metrics.\n\nThe ISCM program assessment accommodates organization-defined metrics. The ISCM program assessment verifies that the ISCM program addresses the specification, development,# Maintenance and Sustainment of Metrics\n\nThe ISCM program assessment also verifies that the organization:\n(i) specifies frequencies of collecting metrics data;\n(ii) determines metrics from data at Levels 1, 2, and 3;\n(iii) applies the metrics as needed to make risk-based decisions. In addition, the ISCM program assessment verifies that ISCM metrics are reported to designated officials at each level who review the relevant metrics.\n\n## 2.1.7 Ongoing Authorization\n\nISCM benefits the organization by facilitating OA, which streamlines the system authorization process and supports a more automated ability to make near real-time risk-based decisions on whether to continue system authorization.

  "## 2.1.7 Ongoing Authorization\n\nISCM benefits the organization by facilitating OA, which streamlines the system authorization process and supports a more automated ability to make near real-time risk-based decisions on whether to continue system authorization. OA is defined as the subsequent (follow-on) risk determinations and risk acceptance decisions taken at agreed-upon and documented frequencies in accordance with the organization's mission/business requirements and organizational risk tolerance. OA is fundamentally related to the ongoing understanding and acceptance of security risk and is dependent on a robust ISCM program.\n\nOrganizations make OA decisions for systems by leveraging security-related information gathered through the ISCM capability. A robust ISCM program defines, establishes, and implements a continuous process by which manual, automated, and procedural tools can be used to manage and govern the risks of operating authorized systems.\n\nThe ISCM program assessment verifies that ISCM information is available for making OA decisions. The ISCM program assessment verifies that:\n\n- There is an organization-wide process for OA. The OA process addresses how systems transition into OA status as well as the conditions necessary for a system to remain in OA status.\n- Control assessments (in accordance with NIST SP 800-53A) are conducted at a documented frequency sufficient to support OA.\n- The metrics provided by the ISCM program are considered sufficiently stable and robust for informing OA decisions.\n- The ISCM program monitors the security status of systems and the environments in which those systems operate on an ongoing basis with a frequency sufficient to make ongoing, risk-based decisions on whether to continue to operate the systems within the organization.\n- ISCM results are reported to appropriate officials who make ongoing authorization decisions.\n\n## 2.2 Foundation of ISCM Program Assessments\n\nAn ISCM program assessment provides organizational leadership with information on the effectiveness and completeness of the organization's ISCM program.

Two examples of limited-scope assessment with the selection of assessment elements are:\n\n- For a Level 1-only scope, only elements that apply to Level 1 are selected.

The rows in the Catalog contain the assessment elements with their attributes.\n\n## 2.2.5 Traceability of ISCM Program Assessment Elements (Chains)\nISCM program assessment elements may be linked together to provide traceability from one element to one or more other elements related to the Parent attribute and based on a particular aspect of the ISCM program (e.g., security status monitoring or ISCM metrics). Assessment elements linked together to provide traceability are called a chain. Chains show the parent/child relationship of elements spanning two or more ISCM process steps.\n\nAssessors may find it beneficial to trace paths through assessment elements by chains as they examine or interview assessment objects at the three organizational risk management levels. For example, one type of artifact or one set of interview questions covering a chain of assessment elements focuses on a narrow subject area (e.g., ISCM strategies) to help assessors make judgments more efficiently.\n\nFigure 2 shows four examples of chains of similar assessment elements, each originating from the Define Step (element 1-032). The character string in the upper left corner of each element provides unique identification of an individual assessment element (with the first numeric character being the ISCM process step).",

The assessor may request a demonstration of automated functionality or artifacts documenting automation. For the fourth chain, the assessor may request artifacts illustrating how data is used to evaluate the ISCM program. Diagrams of the traceability chains are contained in the [Catalog]. These diagrams are arranged by ISCM aspect, such as chains addressing ISCM strategy management, metrics, and control assessment rigor. Assessing elements by aspect (subject), as represented by chains, can yield useful information, particularly when the assessment is scored according to that ISCM aspect or when deficiencies are to be identified in that aspect of ISCM, such as ISCM-relevant metrics.\n\n## 2.2.6 Properties of the ISCM Program Assessment\nThe ISCM program assessment accommodates all aspects of the ISCM program and is grounded in the principles of [SP800-137].

Applying to any organization, regardless of size or complexity.\n9. Maintaining separation and independence from technologies, implementation, and unique organizational or program requirements.\n10. Producing results that lead to actionable recommendations.\n11. Evaluating from a strategic and programmatic perspective rather than specific, tactical issues detected during ISCM.\n12.

Section 2.3.2 explains scoping of the ISCM program assessment.\n\n## 2.2.7.1 Judgment Values\n\nJudgment values vary depending on the level of granularity of evaluation that the organization needs and that the assessor can achieve. While specific judgment values for an assessment are not prescribed in this guidance, the default judgment value set consistent with NIST guidance is the two-value set, Satisfied or Other than Satisfied or, equivalently, True/False.\n\nFor the default set of judgments, each determination statement within an assessment procedure (described in Section 3.3) produces one of the following judgments: Satisfied or Other than Satisfied. The assessment provides for annotations or notes that explain any Other than Satisfied judgment (i.e., what portions of an assessment element prevent a Satisfied judgment). For example, an annotation can document partially completed ISCM aspects so that an organization can track what has been completed and what is lacking. Note that the companion document [Catalog] is established based on the default, two-value set of judgments.\n\nOrganizations may also choose to employ a more granular approach to findings by introducing a Partially Satisfied category for assessments. Finer-grain annotations can be employed with the two-value judgments to give more precise reasons for Other Than Satisfied judgments (See Section 3.3.2 for more detail). Annotations may include a discussion of conditions or situations that do not yield straightforward judgments. Annotations may be assisted by a tool or may be manually recorded during the assessment.\n\nAn example of more granular judgment values is:",

The organization may use the annotated reasons for the two-value set or a finer granularity set of judgment values to: (i) identify shortfalls, (ii) indicate what further actions are required to completely satisfy the determination statement, and (iii) help prioritize potential responses. It is expected that the set of annotations are used to develop the set of recommendations in the assessment.# Results Report\n\n## 2.2.7.2 Making Judgments\n\nSection 3.3 explains assessment elements, which contain guidance on how to arrive at a judgment. The ISCM program assessment element contains the assessment element text (i.e., the assessment criteria) and a set of attributes, two of which are the assessment procedure and the discussion used in making judgments. The assessment procedure attribute consists of one or more assessment objectives derived from the assessment element text and potential assessment methods and objects. The discussion attribute provides supplemental guidance relevant to the assessment element and may provide additional details about special situations or dependencies that the assessor may need to consider (see Section 3.3).\n\nOnce the evidence is obtained or interviews are conducted with the identified potential stakeholders, the assessor makes a judgment about whether the ISCM program meets a given assessment element. The assessor selects one of the possible judgment values defined for the assessment element as the judgment. The two-value judgment set indicates whether the assessment is Satisfied while the multi-valued, finer grained value set indicates how well the assessment element is met (e.g., somewhat true, mostly false).\n\nFigure 3 shows the process for making judgments for an assessment element using the available information.\n\n## 2.2.7.3 N/A Judgments",

It is important to ensure that each assessment element is applicable to the entire organization to the maximum extent. This means that the N/A judgment is not implemented as a judgment value even when some ISCM program assessment functions or aspects are not implemented in the ISCM program (e.g., external service providers are not used), but there are assessment elements to evaluate external service in the assessment.\n\nSince all assessment elements are addressed and not tailored out of an assessment, the following considerations are relevant to the ISCM program assessment:\n\n- Every assessment element is judged.\n- If the subject of an assessment element, such as the use of external service providers, is not applicable to the organization, the organization-wide ISCM strategy specifies that the subject or aspect is not applicable to the organization.\n- Regardless of the organizational decision about the subject, the subject is considered and evaluated throughout the ISCM program assessment.\n- The decision not to implement a particular ISCM aspect means that there is no evidence expected to the contrary, which is verified by the assessor.\n\nIf an ISCM program assessment element is not applicable to the organization or system, it is first addressed in the applicable strategy, and all elements related to that particular subject are judged to be Satisfied.

Multiple assessors can produce multiple assessments that are limited in scope to a part of the organization (e.g., a single mission/business process, a single system).\n\nFor multiple ISCM program assessments at the same risk management level (i.e., by multiple assessors), the organization or assessors decide how to combine multiple judgments for the same assessment element. Multiple judgments for the same assessment element can occur, for example, if the assessors meet separately with each mission/business process. It is also a result of using a distributed self-assessment, as described in Section 2.3.1. There can be significant differences in assessment results across one risk management level. Examples of methods for combining judgments within one organizational risk management level are:\n\n- **Worst case.** The worst judgment (the low water mark) is used as the resulting judgment for the level.\n- **Majority judgment.** The most common judgment is used as the resulting judgment for the level. If there is a tie for the most common judgment, a predetermined rule is used to determine the resulting judgment (e.g., the worst of the tied judgments).\n- **Assessor determined.** The assessor considers all factors and makes an experience-based judgment.",

The concepts there may apply to one or two levels (usually adjacent levels) or to all three levels, depending on the organizational structure and how the organization-wide and system-level ISCM strategies are applied. As a result, each assessment element is evaluated across one or more levels. For example, one element may be evaluated for Level 1 only, while another is evaluated for Levels 1 and 2. For each element, multiple evaluations are combined into a corresponding single judgment regardless of how many levels are being evaluated.\n\nWhen judgments from two or more levels are combined to get the resultant judgment, a method, rule, or algorithm is needed to ensure that judgments are combined consistently. This publication does not prescribe a means to combine judgments. Each organization defines a combining mechanism that meets its needs.\n\nOne or more assessments are conducted for each of the levels involved. Results are combined.# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\ninto a single judgment for each level as described in Section 2.2.8. Results for each of the levels are then reconciled into a single judgment according to organization-defined rules. As an example of a method of combining levels, the following sample rules, based on one of the decision matrices shown in the three figures below, are used:\n\n## Rule 1\nIf the assessment element is applicable to only one level, that level's judgment is the final judgment for the element.\n\n## Rule 2\nIf the assessment element is applicable to exactly two levels, use the decision matrix from Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3.",

As an example of a method of combining levels, the following sample rules, based on one of the decision matrices shown in the three figures below, are used:\n\n## Rule 1\nIf the assessment element is applicable to only one level, that level's judgment is the final judgment for the element.\n\n## Rule 2\nIf the assessment element is applicable to exactly two levels, use the decision matrix from Table 1, Table 2, or Table 3.\n\n## Rule 3\nIf the assessment element is applicable to all three levels:\na. Apply Rule 2 to Levels 2 and 3; then\nb. Apply Rule 2 to Level 1 and the result from Rule 3a.\n\nNote that it is not necessary to use a decision matrix with any of the rules above. A simple rule may be used instead, such as, when combining two judgment values, select the worst-case value as the resultant judgment (or select the majority judgment or use another method).\n\nTable 1 shows an example decision matrix that an assessment may use for combining two levels of judgments using Rules 2 or 3 above. In this example, the approach for combining two levels with different values is to apply the worst-case method, which results in an Other than Satisfied judgment in three of the four cases.\n\nTable 2 presents an alternative matrix for combining two levels that gives priority to the higher level, which has a broader view of the actual business of the organization. Rules 2 and 3 remain the same using the matrix of Table 2; however, the outcome of applying any of the rules is different from the outcome of the Table 1 matrix.\n\nTable 3 presents another alternative matrix for combining two levels that gives priority to the lower level, which may be closer to what is actually occurring in the organization. Rules 2 and 3 remain the same with the matrix of Table 3. However, the outcome of applying any of the rules is different from the matrices of Tables 1 and 2.",

However, the outcome of applying any of the rules is different from the matrices of Tables 1 and 2.\n\n## 2.2.10 Scoring\nWithin an assessment, a score indicates how well the ISCM capability meets its objectives and reflects risk to the organization. Judgments made using the assessment elements may be assigned a score, which is a numerical value representing the judgment that can then be used to calculate assessment results. Scores are assigned to each judgment value, and the resultant score for the organization is computed using the scores of each assessment element. In other words, the assessment score is the sum of all of the element judgment scores.\n\nThe scores may facilitate informed decision-making by organizational leadership regarding the ISCM program and where organizational resources can best be applied to improve the program to reduce risk. Scoring is optional and may be used with the binary and multi-gradation judgment types discussed in Section 2.2.7. Scoring may also be used to aggregate ISCM program assessment scores from across the organization into a single, summary score for.# the entire organization.\n\nUsing the default binary judgment values, each assessment element is assigned one of two possible scores as shown in Table 4. An assessment element score can optionally be multiplied by a weighting factor, which is a numerical value that results in a higher score for that assessment element. Different weights can be assigned to different assessment elements based on the criticality of a given element to an organization. In other words, an organization may create a scheme of weight assignments (i.e., multiple weight factors for multiple priorities of differing importance). Section 2.2.11 explains factors that may affect the criticality of an assessment element. As with any type of numeric scoring, the result can be expressed as a percentage by dividing the score by the best possible score.\n\n## 2.2.11 Criticality",

ISCM program assessment elements may be deemed critical under the following conditions:\n\n- The ISCM program addresses, for example, the following:\n- National cybersecurity concerns (e.g., protecting high-value asset [HVA] information and systems);\n- Serious and pervasive security issues across the Nation, the organization, or a given sector, such as insider threats;\n- National cybersecurity initiatives (e.g., transition to ongoing authorization, presidential cybersecurity initiatives);\n- Proprietary issues that affect the business processes or mission(s) of the organization.\n\n- One part of the ISCM program provides a foundation for the remainder of the program, thereby making the evaluation of certain assessment element(s) important (e.g., ISCM strategies, policies, and procedures are important in evaluating the implementation and/or operation of the ISCM capability).\n\n- The ISCM program is a part of other important commercial needs or national cybersecurity programs or initiatives (e.g., the RMF or Cybersecurity Framework [CSF] [CSF 1.1]).\n\n- The ISCM program covers a broad area of cybersecurity functionality or responsibility (e.g., common controls).\n\nOver the lifetime of an assessment, the designation of critical assessment elements may change to reflect new national cybersecurity priorities, goals, and issues. In addition, critical assessment elements may vary from one organization to another, depending on factors such as the organization's risk tolerance.\n\n## 2.2.12 Reporting of Assessment Results",

There are different ways to characterize the ISCM program assessment process, including type of assessment and type of assessors, depth and duration of the assessment, and expected results of the assessment.\n\n### 2.3.1 Types of ISCM Program Assessments\n\nThere are two types of ISCM program assessment engagements: third-party assessments and self-assessments.\n\n#### Third-party assessments\n\nThird-party assessments are conducted by third-party assessors who are independent of the organization being evaluated. Third-party assessments may be:\n- **External** \u2013 Assessors are employed from outside organizations and are independent.\n- **Internal** \u2013 Assessors are part of the organization but are considered to be independent of the organizational entity under assessment for the assessment task.\n\nThird-party assessments are typically conducted over more than one session and facilitated as follows: the responses from a set of participants are discussed, and the consensus response is decided and noted, such as by entering it into a tool or repository of results by the assessors.\n\n#### Self-assessments\n\nSelf-assessments may be conducted by the staff of the organization or sub-organization being evaluated and as either a distributed or facilitated self-assessment. Self-assessments rely on an objective view of the target and can inform the organization or part of the organization of shortcomings in the ISCM capability early in the development of the ISCM program.",

Alternatively, the self-assessment may be conducted like a facilitated assessment where one staff member or team with subject matter expertise facilitates discussion in a group, and the consensus response is decided and noted, such as by entering the response into a tool or repository of results.\n\n## 2.3.2 Extent and Duration of ISCM Program Assessments\n\nThe extent of the ISCM program assessment is flexible in terms of which process steps it addresses.

The ISCM program assessment has the following characteristics that define the ISCM program assessment scope:\n\n\u2022 The ISCM Define Step is always included to ensure that the foundation of ISCM is evaluated.\n\u2022 The ISCM program assessment can be conducted incrementally and halted after any step. For example, the assessment can:\n- Stop at the Define Step (focus on ISCM program strategy);\n- Stop at the Establish Step (focus on ISCM program design);\n- Stop at the Implement Step (focus on ISCM implementation);\n- Exclude the Review/Update Step (a process improvement step that reflects a relatively mature ISCM program); or\n- Include all Steps (a full ISCM program assessment).\n\nThe ISCM program assessment is flexible enough to allow an assessment to be suspended temporarily at a specific point. Assessment suspension may be beneficial for various reasons (e.g., to make improvements to the ISCM program before continuing). If desired, the assessors may assist the organization in addressing any shortcomings found.\n\n## 2.3.3 Expected Outcomes of ISCM Program Assessments\n\nThe expected outcome of the ISCM program assessment is the improvement of the security posture of the organization and risk reduction. To this end, the ISCM program assessment produces actionable recommendations to improve the ISCM program, such as in the areas of ISCM program design, implementation, operation, and governance.

The ISCM program assessment process defines how to evaluate the organizational ISCM capability, including:\n\n1. the activities carried out by organizations and assessment bodies to prepare for ISCM program assessments,\n2. the development of the ISCM program assessment plan,\n3. the conduct of ISCM program assessments and the analysis and reporting of assessment results, and\n4. post-assessment report analysis and follow-on activities.\n\n### 3.1 Overview of the ISCM Program Assessment Process\n\nA successful ISCM program assessment requires consideration of the needs of all parties with a vested interest in the organization's ISCM capability, including system owners, authorizing officials, chief information officers, chief information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy/chief privacy officers, chief executive officers/heads of agencies, security and privacy staff, Inspectors General or other auditing bodies, the RE(f), and the senior accountable official for risk management.",

The decision may impact authorization decisions to place systems into operation or continue operation (ongoing authorization).\n\nFigure 7 shows the overall process, and details are described in subsequent sections.\n\nWhile an assessment relies on a manual process implemented by assessors, it leverages input from automated ISCM processes as evidence to be used in making judgments. For example, ISCM-produced reports may be supplied to the assessor by an organizational dashboard or security information and event management (SIEM) component; the assessor then uses the ISCM-produced reports to make judgments against one or more specific assessment elements.\n\nThe assessor (or a tool, if available) then collects and aggregates judgment results from assessment participants at all applicable levels to produce an organization-wide judgment, which is the basis for the assessment findings.\n\nThe ISCM program assessment developed under guidance of this publication evaluates the ISCM program itself, not the results of the operational ISCM program. The ISCM program assessment does not have the objectives of:\n\n1. retesting security control effectiveness or operational procedures,\n2. evaluating ISCM implementations, or\n3. validating specific outputs of the.# ISCM Program Assessment\n\nThe ISCM program assessment does not generally review results of individual control assessments but rather verifies that control assessments are performed in accordance with the ISCM strategy at the organization-specified frequencies for all parts of the organization under assessment.",

The guidance in this publication, through the use of the ISCM program assessment elements described in Section 3.3, helps to ensure repeatability in conducting assessments by providing assessor guidance on potential assessment objects to examine, what to look for during the examination, the assessment objective for evaluating each individual assessment element, and the personnel roles to interview. In addition, the discussion attribute of each ISCM assessment element provides guidance on how to make judgments about assessment elements and may specify the valid judgment values that the assessor can select.\n\nSection 3.5 addresses how the organization or assessor may tailor the approach presented in Section 3 to achieve an assessment that meets organizational and assessor needs. An ISCM program assessment is focused directly on evaluating the ISCM program as defined and implemented within the organization and not on evaluating the individual, lower-level components of an ISCM capability, such as individual common, hybrid, and system-specific controls. The ISCM program assessment verifies the existence of the subject of the assessment element (e.g., to verify that specified procedures for performing certain actions at specified frequencies are followed). The ISCM program assessment does not evaluate individual automated, manual, or operational functions of the ISCM capability.\n\n## 3.1.1 ISCM Program Assessment Plan\n\nThe ISCM Program Assessment Plan guides the execution of the ISCM program assessment. The ISCM Program Assessment Plan documents decisions made during the Plan step of the ISCM program assessment process (as described in Section 3.2) and is developed as follows:",

The ISCM Program Assessment Plan documents decisions made during the Plan step of the ISCM program assessment process (as described in Section 3.2) and is developed as follows:\n\n- For a third-party assessment, the assessing team creates the ISCM Program Assessment Plan and submits it to the organization for review and approval. The final version is presented to assessment participants at the kick-off meeting.\n- For a self-assessment, the ISCM Program Assessment Plan is developed internally by key assessment staff and organization management. The ISCM Program Assessment Plan is approved by organizational leadership, who will act upon the results of the ISCM program assessment. The final version is presented to the assessment participants at the kick-off meeting.\n\nThe ISCM Program Assessment Plan specifies but is not limited to the following:\n\n- Type of assessment\n- Scope of assessment\n- Source of staffing\n- Assessor roles and responsibilities# CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT\n\n## Schedule and timeframe\n- Key milestones\n- Activities to be performed sequentially and concurrently\n- Methods for combining assessor judgments across one organizational risk management level\n- Methods for combining assessor judgments across multiple organizational risk management levels\n- Logistics information\n- Assessment tailoring decisions and implementations\n- Type of report (draft report and final report)\n\n## 3.2 ISCM Program Assessment Process Steps\nThe ISCM program assessment is conducted by means of an engagement process, which is a logical, methodical approach to the assessment based on existing assessment approaches.

Planning assumes that each assessment element is applicable to one or more organizational levels. A judgment about an element is made by participants from only one applicable level independently from the judgments made by participants at any other applicable level.\n\nTo achieve a comprehensive ISCM program assessment, assessment leaders ensure that all areas of ISCM to be considered are evaluated by knowledgeable staff, as follows:\n- The team conducting a third-party ISCM program assessment includes staff who are knowledgeable about all of the capabilities included in the ISCM program assessment scope. It also includes, or has reach back to, individuals with operational experience in the various areas of the ISCM program assessment. The relevant skills and experiences are necessary to provide accurate and consistent judgments and meaningful recommendations for improvement.\n- The individuals conducting a self-assessment are knowledgeable about their specific area of ISCM.\n\nPrior to detailed planning, it is helpful to review an initial set of foundational artifacts (e.g., the organization-wide ISCM strategy and an organization chart).

  "## 3.3 ISCM Program Assessment Elements\nThe ISCM program assessment element defines the evaluation criteria applied to each aspect of the ISCM program being assessed. In order to determine if an ISCM program assessment element is Satisfied, assessors use the associated assessment procedure to obtain and review evidence. The assessment procedures apply to the same organizational levels as the assessment elements.\n\nWhen an ISCM program assessment element is added or modified for a specific assessment of the organization, the corresponding assessment procedure information is created or modified. Other attributes, such as discussion, are also added or modified. Section 3.5 explains how to tailor the ISCM program assessment process, including the assessment elements. The ISCM program assessment elements promote repeatability of the ISCM program assessment process and offer the necessary flexibility to customize assessments based on scope, organizational structure, policies and procedures, operational considerations, system and network architecture, and tolerance for risk.\n\n### 3.3.1 Assessment Element Information Fields\nThe information fields of the assessment element, including contextual information or attributes of the assessment element, are defined below.\n\n- **Identifier.** A string that uniquely identifies the assessment element and indicates the ISCM step number (see Section 2.1.2) and a sequence number.\n- **Assessment Element Text.** Defines the evaluation criteria applied to an aspect of the ISCM program being assessed. The text of the assessment element is a statement with which the assessor determines whether, or how well, the objective has been met.\n- **Level.** The applicable organizational risk management level(s) defined in [SP800-39]. See Section 2.1.3 for more information about applying the ISCM assessment element to organizational risk management levels.\n- **Source.** Authoritative publications or practices from which the ISCM program.# Assessment Elements\n\nAssessment elements are derived.\n\n## Assessment Procedure\n\nThe assessment procedure is a multi-part attribute that specifies a set of actions to be carried out on evidence gathered by the assessor to determine if an assessment objective has been met. Each assessment procedure consists of (i) an assessment objective, (ii) a set of potential assessment methods, and (iii) assessment objects that are used to conduct the ISCM program assessment as follows:\n\n### Assessment Objective",
  "Assessment elements are derived.\n\n## Assessment Procedure\n\nThe assessment procedure is a multi-part attribute that specifies a set of actions to be carried out on evidence gathered by the assessor to determine if an assessment objective has been met. Each assessment procedure consists of (i) an assessment objective, (ii) a set of potential assessment methods, and (iii) assessment objects that are used to conduct the ISCM program assessment as follows:\n\n### Assessment Objective\n\nEach assessment objective includes a determination statement related to the assessment element text. The determination statement (i.e., \"Determine if\u2026\") refers to the content of the assessment element text and determines whether or how well the evaluated aspect of the ISCM program meets the underlying ISCM principle or requirement specified in the applicable source for that element. The application of an assessment procedure to an aspect of the ISCM program under evaluation produces an assessment finding, which reflects whether or how well the assessment element is met.\n\n### Potential Assessment Methods and Objects\n\nThe assessment procedure contains a specification of the suggested assessment methods and the objects to which the methods are applied. The assessment method defines the nature and extent of the assessor's actions. The potential assessment methods relevant to ISCM program assessment are:\n\n- **Examine**: The process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing one or more of the assessment objects. The purpose of the examine method is to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence.\n- **Interview**: The process of holding discussions with individuals or groups of individuals to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence.\n\nThe organization and the assessor coordinate with respect to the evidence needed to provide the level of assurance about ISCM program effectiveness desired by the organization. In all three assessment methods, the evidence is used in making specific determinations called for in the determination statements to confirm the objectives of the assessment procedures.\n\n### Assessment Objects\n\nAssessment objects are the potential items (evidence) to which an assessment method is applied. Assessment objects can include specifications, mechanism outputs, activities, and individuals that help the assessor make judgments about whether or how well the assessment element is satisfied by an aspect of the ISCM program. Specifications are document-based artifacts, such as:\n\n- ISCM strategies,\n- ISCM program policies and procedures,\n- System security plans,\n- Security requirements,\n- ISCM automation functional specifications, and\n- ISCM technical architecture designs.",

Each chain label provides a short descriptive name to refer to the group of related ISCM program assessment elements.\n\n## Chain Sort\n\nA key for sorting assessment elements so that they are grouped into chains and ordered by Process Step within the chain. Organizations are not expected to employ all assessment methods and objects contained within the assessment procedures; rather, organizations have the flexibility to choose methods and objects, and to determine the level of effort needed and the assurance required for an assessment (i.e., which assessment methods and assessment objects are deemed to be the most useful in obtaining the desired results).\n\nTable 5 shows the format of the assessment element and its attributes, as defined in the Assessment Element Catalog [Catalog].

The assessment objective is a re-statement of the assessment element, and the assessor makes a judgment of the degree to which a particular aspect of the ISCM program satisfies the element.\n\nEach determination statement contained within an assessment objective of the assessment element (as shown in Table 6) produces, for example, one of the following judgments for the two-value judgment set (described in Section 2.2.6): Satisfied or Other than Satisfied. A finding of Satisfied indicates that for the portion of the ISCM program being assessed, the assessment information obtained (i.e., evidence collected) indicates that the assessment objective for that assessment element has been met and produces an acceptable result. For a finding of Other than Satisfied, the assessment provides for annotated reasons that explain the# Judgment\n\n(i.e., what portions of an assessment element prevent a Satisfied judgment). The reasons inform the organization of shortfalls in the ISCM program that may need to be addressed. A finding of Other than Satisfied may also indicate that the assessor was unable to obtain sufficient information to make the determination called for in the determination statement.\n\nFor assessment findings that are Other than Satisfied, organizations may choose to define subcategories of findings that indicate the severity or criticality of the weaknesses or deficiencies discovered and the potential adverse effects on organizations. Defining such subcategories can help to establish priorities for needed risk mitigation actions. Regardless of whether the organization defines subcategories, assessment results include sufficient information about shortfalls to indicate what further actions are required to completely satisfy the determination statement.\n\n## Figure 8\n\nIllustrates the use of the assessment element using the example element presented in Table 6.\n\n## Use of Example Assessment Item Information\n\nSteps 1 through 4 explain how the information fields of the example assessment element in Table 6 are used to arrive at a judgment about the example assessment element.",

Tailoring also helps facilitate adoption of the assessment across the entire organization where the sub-organizations may vary in degree of implementation or risk environment. Assessment elements and assessment procedures are flexible enough to be tailored to meet the organization's needs.\n\nTailoring the ISCM program assessment may be needed based on an organization's specific implementation of the ISCM program. For example, the assessment for federal agencies is tailored in a way that helps determine whether organizational ISCM programs meet the federal ISCM requirements from the authoritative sources. ISCM program assessment tailoring is coordinated with the assessment organization to ensure that the ISCM program assessment still verifies the required aspects of ISCM. All tailoring decisions are documented in the ISCM Program Assessment Plan.\n\n### Tailoring the ISCM Program Assessment Scope\n\nAt the start of the tailoring...# Activity\n\nDecisions about the scope of the ISCM program assessment are made, such as which systems and system components (e.g., user endpoints, servers, networking components) are to be assessed with respect to the ISCM program implementation to provide credible assessment evidence.\n\nTailoring the ISCM program assessment scope involves understanding the organization's ISCM requirements and constraints and modifying the assessment elements where necessary. For example, tailoring may be based on organizational structure (e.g., number and size of sub-organizations) or ISCM maturity, such as disparity in ISCM maturity among mission/business processes.\n\nThe scope of the assessment is determined by the organization's leadership. Assessment elements are tailored out of the catalog for a narrower scope (e.g., if the assessment is limited or incremental by the number of ISCM process steps), as described in Sections 2.3.2 and 3.4. The assessment scope may also be limited to specific risk management levels (e.g., for a Level 1-only [organizational] scope or a Level 3-only [system-level] scope).\n\n## Tailoring the Assessment Elements",

Assessment elements may be reworded to incorporate concepts created by new technologies or techniques. The assessment element set may be tailored by creating additional elements or modified by rewording, as described in Section 2.2.7.\n\nIf the ISCM program assessment is assisted by a tool, the tailoring of individual assessment elements may be problematic if the tool is not designed for modification of the assessment elements and their attributes.\n\n## 3.6 Conclusion of the ISCM Program Assessment\n\nThe ISCM program assessment may provide the organization with recommendations to improve the ISCM program, including areas of ISCM program design, implementation, operation, and governance. At the conclusion of an assessment, the assessors present a draft report, and after discussion with organization leadership, a final report that resolves any differences of opinion between the assessors and the organization is presented to the organization. See Sections 2.2.12 and 3.2.3 for more information on reporting ISCM program assessment results.\n\nThe ISCM program assessment process may be intense and short-lived, or it may continue at a lower level of effort.
