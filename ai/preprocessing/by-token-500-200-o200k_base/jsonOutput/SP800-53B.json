There are three security control baselines (one for each system impact level\u2014low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact), as well as a privacy baseline that is applied to systems irrespective of impact level. In addition to the control baselines, this publication provides tailoring guidance and a set of working assumptions that help guide and inform the control selection process. Finally, this publication provides guidance on the development of overlays to facilitate control baseline customization for specific communities of interest, technologies, and environments of operation.\n\n# RISK MANAGEMENT\nOrganizations must exercise due diligence in managing information security and privacy risk. This is accomplished, in part, by establishing a comprehensive risk management program that uses the flexibility inherent in NIST publications to categorize systems, select and implement security and privacy controls that meet mission and business needs, assess the effectiveness of the controls, authorize the systems for operation, and continuously monitor the systems. Exercising due diligence and implementing robust and comprehensive information security and privacy risk management programs can facilitate compliance with applicable laws, regulations, executive orders, and government-wide policies. Risk management frameworks and risk management processes are essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the protection measures necessary to address stakeholder needs and the current threats to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based processes, procedures, methods, and technologies ensures that information systems and organizations have the necessary trustworthiness and resiliency to support essential mission and business functions, the U.S. critical infrastructure, and continuity of government.\n\n# COMMON SECURITY AND PRIVACY FOUNDATIONS\nIn working with the Office of Management and Budget to develop standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with federal agencies; state, local, and tribal governments; and private sector organizations to improve information security and privacy, avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort, and help ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and guidelines used for the protection of national security systems. In addition to a comprehensive and transparent public review and comment process, NIST is engaged in a collaborative partnership with the Office of Management and Budget, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Department of Defense, Committee on National Security Systems, Federal CIO Council, and Federal Privacy Council to establish a Risk Management Framework (RMF) for\n```# Information Security and Privacy for the Federal Government",

Using the tailoring guidance and assumptions provided, organizations can customize their security and privacy control baselines to ensure that they have the capability to protect their critical and essential operations and assets.\n\n## Chapter One\n\n### Introduction\n\n#### The Need for Security and Privacy Control Baselines\n\nSecurity controls are the safeguards or countermeasures selected and implemented within an information system or an organization to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information and to manage information security risk. Privacy controls are the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within a system or an organization to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements and to manage privacy risks. Security and privacy controls are selected and implemented to satisfy the security and privacy requirements levied on an information system and/or organization. The requirements are derived from applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and mission needs to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information processed, stored, or transmitted and to manage risks to individual privacy. The selection, design, and effective implementation of controls are important tasks that have significant implications for the operations and assets of organizations as well as the welfare of individuals and the Nation.\n\nNIST Special Publication (SP) 800-37 [SP 800-37] defines two approaches for the selection of security and privacy controls: a baseline control selection approach and an organization-generated control selection approach. The baseline control selection approach uses control baselines, which are predefined sets of controls specifically assembled to meet the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of interest. The control baselines serve as a starting point for the protection of individuals' privacy, information, and information systems. The organization-generated control selection approach is not addressed in this publication.\n\n### 1.1 Purpose and Applicability",

The organization-generated control selection approach is not addressed in this publication.\n\n### 1.1 Purpose and Applicability\n\nThis publication establishes security and privacy control baselines for federal information systems and organizations and provides tailoring guidance for those baselines. The control baselines can be implemented by any organization that processes, stores, or transmits information (e.g., federal, state, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations). Implementation of a minimum set of controls selected from NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5 [SP 800-53] is mandatory to protect federal information and information systems in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 [OMB A-130].\n```# the provisions of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act [FISMA].\n\nWhereas use of the privacy control baseline is not mandated by law or [OMB A-130], SP 800-53B\u2014along with other supporting NIST publications\u2014is designed to help organizations identify the security and privacy controls needed to manage risk and to satisfy the security and privacy requirements in FISMA, the Privacy Act of 1974 [PRIVACT], selected OMB policies (e.g., [OMB A-130]), and designated Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), among others. This publication satisfies security and privacy requirements by applying assumptions that inform the development of the security and privacy control baselines, as described in Section 2.3. The baselines serve as a starting point to meet the protection needs of organizations. The controls in the baselines are tailored following the process described in Section 2.4 to further facilitate the management of security and privacy risk specific to the organization. The tailoring process can be guided and informed by many factors, including organizational mission and business needs, stakeholder protection needs, and assessments of risk. The combination of control baseline selection and control tailoring processes can help organizations satisfy their stated security and privacy requirements.",

The controls comprising the baselines are periodically reviewed and revised to reflect the experience gained from using the controls; new or revised laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and standards; changing security and privacy requirements; emerging threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and information processing methods; and the availability of new technologies. Thus, the security and privacy controls specified in the baselines are also expected to change over time as controls are withdrawn, revised, and added. In addition to the need for change, the need for stability is addressed by requiring that proposed changes to the baseline undergo a rigorous and transparent public review process to obtain public and private sector feedback and to build a consensus for baseline changes. The public review process provides a stable, flexible, and technically sound set of security and privacy control baselines.\n\n## 1.6 PUBLICATION ORGANIZATION\n\nThe remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:",

The selected controls, if correctly implemented and determined to be effective, meet security and privacy requirements defined by applicable laws, executive orders, policies, regulations, and directives. There is no single set of controls that addresses all security and privacy concerns in every situation. However, choosing the most appropriate controls for a specific situation or system to adequately respond to risk requires a fundamental understanding of the organization's mission and business priorities, the mission and business functions that the systems will support, and the environments in which the systems will operate. It also requires close collaboration with key organizational stakeholders. With that understanding, organizations can demonstrate how to efficiently and cost-effectively assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information and systems, as well as the privacy of individuals in the context of supporting the organization's mission and business functions.",

A control baseline is a collection of controls from [SP 800-53] assembled to address the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of interest. It provides a generalized set of controls that represents a starting point for the subsequent tailoring activities that are applied to the baseline to produce a targeted or customized security and privacy solution for the entity that the baseline is intended to serve.

Privacy risk assessments include evaluating the applicability of legal and policy requirements for their programs. For example, organizations may remove controls or control enhancements related to legal or policy requirements that are not applicable to them unless they determine that, based on a privacy risk assessment, the controls or control enhancements would be helpful in mitigating identified privacy risks. In addition, organizations may add unassigned controls or control enhancements to mitigate privacy risks specific to their information systems as determined by their privacy risk assessments.\n\n## 2.3 Control Baseline Assumptions\n\nThe control baselines in Chapter Three address the protection needs of a diverse set of constituencies, including individual users and organizations.

The tailoring process is part of an organization-wide risk management process that includes framing, assessing, responding to, and monitoring information security and privacy risks. Tailoring decisions are dependent on organizational or system-specific factors. While tailoring decisions are focused on security and privacy considerations, the decisions are typically aligned with other risk-related issues that organizations must routinely address.

Organizations have the flexibility to tailor at the organization level for systems in support of a line of business or a mission or business process, at the individual system level, or by using a combination of the two. However, organizations do not arbitrarily remove security and privacy controls from baselines. Tailoring decisions are expected to be defensible based on mission and business needs, a sound rationale, and explicit risk-based determinations.\n\nTailoring decisions, including the risk-based justification for the decisions, are documented in the system security and privacy plans for organizational systems. Every control from the selected control baseline is accounted for by the organization. If certain controls are tailored out, the rationale is recorded in the system security and privacy plans and subsequently approved by the responsible officials within the organization as part of the approval process for the plans. Documenting risk management decisions during the baseline tailoring process is imperative for organizational officials to have the necessary information to make credible, risk-based decisions regarding security and privacy and to do so in a manner that fully supports transparency, traceability, and accountability.\n\n## Identifying and Designating Common Controls\n\nCommon controls are controls that may be inherited by one or more organizational systems. If a system inherits a common control provided by another entity (internal or external), there is no need to implement the control within that system. Organizational decisions on which controls are designated as common controls may affect the responsibilities of individual system owners with regard to the implementation of the controls in a baseline. Common control providers ensure that current implementation information and assessment results are available to facilitate decision making by system owners and authorizing officials. System owners and authorizing officials determine if the common controls available for inheritance actually provide protection commensurate with risk for inheriting systems.# Common Control Designation and Control Implementation",

Common control providers ensure that current implementation information and assessment results are available to facilitate decision making by system owners and authorizing officials. System owners and authorizing officials determine if the common controls available for inheritance actually provide protection commensurate with risk for inheriting systems.# Common Control Designation and Control Implementation\n\nCommon control designation and control implementation can affect organizations' resource expenditures. That is, in general, the greater the number of common controls implemented, the greater the potential cost savings since the protective measures are amortized over many systems. Additionally, the deployment of controls as common controls often provides a more standardized, stable, scalable, and secure implementation across the organization as opposed to the same control implemented separately on multiple individual systems.\n\n## Applying Scoping Considerations\n\nScoping considerations, when applied in conjunction with risk management guidance, provide organizations with a more granular foundation on which to make risk-based decisions. The application of these scoping considerations can eliminate unnecessary controls from the initial control baselines and ensure that organizations select only those controls that are needed to provide a level of protection that is commensurate with risk. Organizations may apply the scoping considerations described below as needed to assist with making risk-based decisions regarding control selection and specification.\n\n### Control Implementation, Applicability, and Placement Considerations\n\nThe growing complexity of systems requires careful analysis in the implementation of security and privacy controls. Controls in the initial baselines may not be applicable to every component in the system. Controls are applicable only to system components that provide or support the security or privacy functions or capabilities addressed by the controls. Organizations make explicit risk-based decisions about where to apply or allocate specific controls in organizational systems to achieve the needed security or privacy function or capability and to satisfy security and privacy requirements.\n\n### Operational and Environmental Considerations",

Organizations make explicit risk-based decisions about where to apply or allocate specific controls in organizational systems to achieve the needed security or privacy function or capability and to satisfy security and privacy requirements.\n\n### Operational and Environmental Considerations\n\nCertain controls in the control baselines assume the existence of operational or environmental factors. Where operational or environmental factors are absent or significantly diverge from the baseline assumptions described in Section 2.3, it is justifiable to tailor the baseline. Common operational and environmental factors include mobile devices and operations; single-user systems and operations; data connectivity and bandwidth; air-gapped systems; systems that have very limited or sporadic bandwidth, such as tactical systems that support warfighter or law enforcement missions; cyber-physical systems, sensors, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices; limited functionality systems, such as facsimile machines, printers, and digital cameras; systems that process, store, or transmit non-persistent information or that use virtualization techniques to establish non-persistent instantiations of operating systems and applications; and systems that require public access.\n\n### Technology Considerations\n\nControls that refer to specific technologies\u2014such as wireless, cryptography, or public key.```markdown\n# Infrastructure Considerations\n\nInfrastructure\u2014are applicable only if those technologies are implemented or required for use within organizational systems. Controls that can be effectively supported by automated mechanisms do not require the development of such mechanisms if the mechanisms do not already exist or are not readily available in commercial or government off-the-shelf products. If automated mechanisms are not available, cost-effective, or technically feasible, compensating controls implemented through non-automated mechanisms or procedures can be implemented to satisfy specified controls or control enhancements.\n\n## Mission and Business Considerations\n\nCertain controls may not be appropriate if implementing those controls has the potential to degrade, debilitate, or interfere with organizational mission or business functions, including endangering or harming individuals. However, decisions on the appropriateness of control implementation always consider legislative, regulatory, and policy requirements.\n\n## Security Objective Considerations",

However, decisions on the appropriateness of control implementation always consider legislative, regulatory, and policy requirements.\n\n## Security Objective Considerations\n\nControls that support only one or two of the security objectives (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, or availability) may be downgraded to the corresponding control in a lower baseline (or modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower baseline) only if the downgrading action reflects the [FIPS 199] security category for the supported security objectives before considering the [FIPS 200] impact level (i.e., high water mark), is supported by an organizational assessment of risk, and does not adversely affect the level of protection for the security-relevant information within the system. For example, if a system is categorized as moderate-impact using the high water mark concept because confidentiality and/or integrity are moderate but availability is low, there are several controls that only support the availability security objective and that could potentially be downgraded to the low baseline controls. In this scenario, it may be appropriate to refrain from implementing CP-2(1) because the control enhancement only supports availability and is selected in the moderate baseline but not in the low baseline. The following security controls and control enhancements are candidates for downgrading for each of the security categories:",
  "- **Support Only Confidentiality:** AC-21, MA-3(3), MP-3, MP-4, MP-5, MP-6(1), MP-6(2), PE-4, PE-5, SC-4\n- **Support Only Integrity:** CM-5, CM-5(1), CM-5(3), SI-7, SI-7(1), SI-7(5), SI-10\n- **Support Only Availability:** CP-2(1), CP-2(2), CP-2(3), CP-2(5), CP-2(8), CP-3(1), CP-4(1), CP-4(2), CP-6, CP-6(1), CP-6(2), CP-6(3), CP-7, CP-7(1), CP-7(2), CP-7(3), CP-7(4), CP-7(6), CP-8, CP-8(1), CP-8(2), CP-8(3), CP-8(4), CP-8(5), CP-9(2), CP-9(3), CP-9(5), CP-9(6), CP-10(2), CP-10(4), CP-11, MA-6, PE-9, PE-10, PE-11, PE-11(1), PE-13(1), PE-13(2), PE-15(1)\n\n## Legal and Policy Considerations\n\nAlthough controls that are used to meet legislative, regulatory, or policy requirements are not to be tailored out of control baselines, some legislative, regulatory, or policy requirements may only apply in specified circumstances. It is justifiable to tailor the baseline.\n```# When These Circumstances Are Not Applicable to an Organization or Certain Systems\n\n## Selecting Compensating Controls",
  "## Legal and Policy Considerations\n\nAlthough controls that are used to meet legislative, regulatory, or policy requirements are not to be tailored out of control baselines, some legislative, regulatory, or policy requirements may only apply in specified circumstances. It is justifiable to tailor the baseline.\n```# When These Circumstances Are Not Applicable to an Organization or Certain Systems\n\n## Selecting Compensating Controls\n\nCompensating controls are used by organizations in lieu of specific controls in control baselines. The use of compensating controls is appropriate when controls are tailored out of the control baseline by necessity, but the protection provided by the controls is still needed to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Compensating controls are often chosen when implementing a baseline control is technically infeasible, not cost effective, or the control implementation negatively affects organizational mission or business functions. For technology-based scoping considerations, compensating controls may be temporary and used only until the system is updated. Compensating controls are intended to provide equivalent or comparable protection for systems, organizations, and individuals. Compensating controls are selected after applying the scoping considerations in the tailoring process. To use compensating controls, organizations:\n\n- Select compensating controls from the control catalog in [SP 800-53].\n- Provide a rationale for how compensating controls satisfy security or privacy requirements and why the baseline controls could not be implemented.\n- Adopt suitable compensating controls from other sources if appropriate compensating controls are not available in [SP 800-53].\n- Assess and accept the security and privacy risks associated with implementing compensating controls.\n\n## Assigning Control Parameter Values\n\nControls and control enhancements containing embedded parameters (i.e., assignment and selection operations) give organizations the flexibility to specify values for certain portions of controls and control enhancements to support specific organizational requirements. After the application of scoping considerations and the selection of compensating controls, organizations review the controls and control enhancements for assignment or selection operations and determine the appropriate organization-defined values for the identified parameters. The parameter values may be driven by mission or business requirements, or the values may be prescribed by laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, or industry best practices.",

The parameter values may be driven by mission or business requirements, or the values may be prescribed by laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, or industry best practices.\n\nOnce organizations specify the parameter values for the controls and control enhancements, the specified assignment and selection values become a permanent part of the control and control enhancement. As such, they are documented in security and privacy program plans or system security and privacy plans, as appropriate. Organizations can specify the parameter values before selecting compensating controls since the parameter specification completes the control definitions and may affect the need for compensating controls. There can be significant benefits to collaborating on the development of parameter values for controls.# Organizations that Work Together\n\nOrganizations that work together on a frequent basis or regularly conduct exchanges of information, it may be useful to develop a mutually agreeable set of control parameter values.\n\n## Supplementing Control Baselines\n\nIn certain situations, additional controls or control enhancements beyond the controls and enhancements contained in the control baselines in Chapter Three may be required to address specific threats to organizations, mission and business processes, and systems; to address specific types of PII processing and associated privacy risks; and to satisfy the requirements of laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizational assessments of risk provide information for determining the necessity and sufficiency of the controls and control enhancements in the control baselines. Organizations are encouraged to make maximum use of the control catalog in [SP 800-53] to supplement control baselines with additional controls or control enhancements.\n\n## Providing Additional Specification Information for Control Implementation",

Organizations are encouraged to make maximum use of the control catalog in [SP 800-53] to supplement control baselines with additional controls or control enhancements.\n\n## Providing Additional Specification Information for Control Implementation\n\nSince controls and control enhancements are statements of security or privacy functions or capabilities that are conveyed at higher levels of abstraction, the controls may lack sufficient information for implementation. Therefore, additional details may be necessary to fully define the intent of a given control for implementation purposes and to ensure that the security and privacy requirements related to that control are satisfied. For example, additional information may be provided as part of the process of moving from control to specification requirements and may involve refinement of implementation details, refinement of scope, or iteration to apply the same control differently to different scopes. The need to provide control specification information occurs routinely when controls are employed in a systems engineering process as part of requirements engineering. Organizations ensure that if existing control information is not sufficient to define the intended implementation details for the control, such information is provided to system owners and common control providers. Organizations have the flexibility to determine whether control specification information is included as part of the control statement or in a separate control addendum section. When providing additional detail, organizations are cautioned not to change the intent of the base control or modify the original language in the control. Implementation information is documented in the system security and privacy plans.\n\n## 2.5 Capabilities\n\nOrganizations consider defining a set of capabilities as a precursor to the control selection process. The concept of capability recognizes that satisfying security or privacy requirements seldom derives from a single control but rather from a set of mutually reinforcing controls. For example, organizations may wish to define a capability for secure remote authentication. This```markdown\n# Capability and Control Implementation",

For example, organizations may wish to define a capability for secure remote authentication. This```markdown\n# Capability and Control Implementation\n\nCapability can be achieved by the selection and implementation of a set of controls from [SP 800-53], such as IA-2 (1), IA-2 (2), IA-2 (8), IA-2 (9), and SC-8 (1). Moreover, capabilities can address a variety of areas that can include technical means, physical means, procedural means, or any combination thereof. In addition to the above capability for secure remote access, organizations may also need security capabilities that address physical means, such as tamper detection on a cryptographic module or anomaly detection/analysis on an orbiting spacecraft.\n\nAs the number of controls in [SP 800-53] grows in response to an increasingly sophisticated threat space, it is important for organizations to have the ability to describe key capabilities needed to protect organizational missions and business functions, and to subsequently select controls that\u2014if properly designed, developed, and implemented\u2014produce such capabilities.\n\nThe use of capabilities simplifies how the protection problem is viewed conceptually.

Using the construct of a capability provides a method of grouping controls that are employed for a common purpose or to achieve a common objective. For example, the grouping of controls is an important consideration when assessing controls for effectiveness.\n\nTraditionally, assessments have been conducted on a control-by-control basis, producing results that are characterized as pass (i.e., control satisfied) or fail (i.e., control not satisfied). However, the failure of a single control, or in some cases, multiple controls may not affect the overall capability needed by an organization. Moreover, employing the broader construct of a capability allows an organization to assess the severity of the vulnerabilities in its systems and determine if the failure of a particular control or the decision not to deploy a control affects the capability needed for mission and business protection. It also facilitates conducting root cause analyses to determine if the failure of one control can be traced to the failure of other controls based on the established control relationships. Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the degree to which the desired capabilities have been effectively achieved and are meeting the security and privacy requirements defined by an organization. These risk-based decisions are directly related to the organizational risk tolerance that is defined as part of an organization's risk management strategy.\n\n# Chapter Three\n\n## The Control Baselines\n\n### Security and Privacy Control Baselines\n\nTables 3-1 through 3-20 provide a listing of the controls and control enhancements assigned to the control families in [SP 800-53] and the respective control allocations to the privacy control baseline and the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact security control baselines.

Since Senior Agency Officials for Privacy (SAOPs) have the responsibility for managing privacy risk in accordance with [OMB A-130], and since privacy risks arise from both the processing of PII and the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PII, it is important that organizations consider how privacy and security programs collaborate in activities related to these controls, such as categorization, tailoring, implementation, and assessment.\n\n- Controls and control enhancements that are assigned only to the privacy control baseline and not to the security control baselines are important for managing privacy program responsibilities under [OMB A-130] but do not generally support the management of risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- Controls and control enhancements that are assigned to both the privacy and security control baselines are used to manage privacy program responsibilities under [OMB A-130] and risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (including PII).\n\n- Some controls and control enhancements are not assigned to any control baseline.
