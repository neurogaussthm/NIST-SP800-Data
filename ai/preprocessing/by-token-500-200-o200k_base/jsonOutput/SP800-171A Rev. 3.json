This publication provides organizations with assessment procedures and a methodology that can be used to conduct assessments of the security requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be customized to the needs of organizations and assessors. Assessments can be conducted as independent, third-party assessments or as government-sponsored assessments. The assessments can be applied with various degrees of rigor based on customer-defined depth and coverage attributes.\n\n## 1. Introduction\nThe security assessment process gathers information and produces evidence to determine the effectiveness of security requirements by:\n- Identifying potential problems or shortfalls in security and risk management programs\n- Identifying security weaknesses and deficiencies in systems and the environments in which those systems operate\n- Prioritizing risk mitigation decisions and activities\n- Confirming that identified security weaknesses and deficiencies in the system and environment of operation have been addressed\n- Supporting continuous monitoring activities and providing information security situational awareness\n\n### 1.1. Purpose and Applicability\nThe purpose of this publication is to provide procedures for assessing the security requirements in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations [3]. Organizations can use the assessment procedures to generate evidence that the security requirements have been satisfied. The scope of the security assessments conducted using the procedures described in this publication is guided and informed by the system security plans for systems that process, store, or transmit CUI. The assessment procedures offer the flexibility to customize assessments based on organizational policies and requirements, known threat and vulnerability information, system and platform dependencies, operational considerations, and tolerance for risk.\n\n### 1.2. Organization of This Publication\nThe remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:\n- Section 2 describes the fundamental concepts associated with assessments of security requirements, including assessment procedures, methods, objects, and assurance cases that can be created using the evidence produced during assessments.\n- Section 3 provides assessment procedures for the security requirements in SP 800-171, including assessment objectives and potential assessment methods and objects for each.\n```# Procedure\n\nThe following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI:",

Organization of This Publication\nThe remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:\n- Section 2 describes the fundamental concepts associated with assessments of security requirements, including assessment procedures, methods, objects, and assurance cases that can be created using the evidence produced during assessments.\n- Section 3 provides assessment procedures for the security requirements in SP 800-171, including assessment objectives and potential assessment methods and objects for each.\n```# Procedure\n\nThe following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI:\n\n- References\n- Appendix A: Acronyms\n- Appendix B: Glossary\n- Appendix C: Security Requirement Assessments\n- Appendix D: Organization-Defined Parameters\n- Appendix E: Change Log\n\nThe contents of this publication can be used for many different assessment-related purposes to determine organizational compliance with the security requirements. The broad range of potential assessment methods and objects listed in this publication does not necessarily reflect and should not be directly associated with actual compliance or noncompliance. Rather, the selection of specific assessment methods and objects from the list provided can help generate a picture of overall compliance with the security requirements. There is no expectation about the number of methods or objects needed to determine compliance with the security requirements. Moreover, the entire list of potential assessment objects should not be viewed as required artifacts needed to determine compliance. Organizations have the flexibility to determine the specific methods and objects sufficient to obtain the needed evidence to support any claims of compliance.\n\n## 2. The Fundamentals\n\nThe process used by organizations and assessors to assess the security requirements in SP 800-171 [3] includes (1) preparing for the assessment, (2) developing a security assessment plan, (3) conducting the assessment, and (4) documenting, analyzing, and reporting the assessment results. The remainder of this section describes the structure and content of the procedures used to assess the security requirements and the importance of assurance cases in providing the evidence necessary to determine compliance with the requirements.\n\n### 2.1. Assessment Procedures\n\nThe security requirements in SP 800-171 are organized into 17 families, as illustrated in Table 1. The assessment procedures in Sec. 3 are grouped by similar family designations to ensure the completeness and consistency of assessments. The procedures have been derived from the assessment procedures in SP 800-53A [5].",

The assessment procedures in Sec. 3 are grouped by similar family designations to ensure the completeness and consistency of assessments. The procedures have been derived from the assessment procedures in SP 800-53A [5].\n\nAn assessment procedure consists of an assessment objective and a set of potential assessment methods and objects that can be used to conduct the assessment. Each potential assessment objective includes a determination statement related to the security requirement. If there is an organization-defined parameter (ODP) in the security requirement, then the assessment objective begins with a determination statement related to the definition of the ODP. The determination statements are linked to the content of the security requirements to help ensure traceability of the assessment results to the requirements.```markdown\n# Assessment Objects\n\nAssessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and can include specifications, mechanisms, activities, and individuals. Specifications are the documented artifacts (e.g., plans, policies, procedures, requirements, functional and assurance specifications, design documentation, and architectures) associated with a system. Mechanisms are the hardware, software, and firmware safeguards implemented within a system. Activities are the protection-related actions supporting a system that involve people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, exercising an incident response plan, and monitoring network traffic). Individuals are the people applying the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.\n\n# Assessment Methods",

Individuals are the people applying the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.\n\n# Assessment Methods\n\nAssessment methods define the nature and extent of the assessor's actions and are used to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The assessment methods include examine, interview, and test. The examine method is the process of reviewing, studying, inspecting, or analyzing assessment objects. The interview method is the process of holding discussions with individuals or groups about assessment objects. The test method is the process of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities, mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior. Assessment methods include attributes of depth and coverage, which define the rigor, scope, and level of effort for the assessment as well as the degree of assurance that the security requirements have been satisfied. See SP 800-53A, Appendix C, Assessment Method Descriptions [5].\n\n# Assessment Procedure Example\n\nThe structure and content of an assessment procedure are provided in the example below:\n\n## 03.01.06 Least Privilege \u2013 Privileged Accounts\n\n### ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE\n\nDetermine if:\n\n- A.03.01.06.ODP[01]: personnel or roles to which privileged accounts on the system are to be restricted are defined.\n- A.03.01.06.a: privileged accounts on the system are restricted to <A.03.01.06.ODP[01]: personnel or roles>.\n- A.03.01.06.b: users (or roles) with privileged accounts are required to use non-privileged accounts when accessing non-security functions or non-security information.\n\n### ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS\n\n**Examine**",

Each determination statement begins with the letter \"A\" to indicate that it is part of an assessment procedure. The next sequence of numbers or letters (e.g., 03.01.01.e or 03.01.01.f.02) indicates the security requirement identifier from NIST SP 800-171 (and the specific control item if it is a multi-part requirement) that is the target of the assessment. Organization-defined parameters are indicated by the letters \"ODP.\" If there are multiple ODPs in the determination statement, the ODP number is indicated in a square bracket (e.g., A.03.01.08.ODP[01]). Square brackets are also used to denote when an assessment procedure further decomposes a requirement into more granular determination statements (e.g., A.03.01.12.a[01], A.03.01.12.a[02], A.03.01.12.a[03]).\n\nThe application of an assessment procedure to a security requirement produces assessment results or findings. The findings are compiled and used as evidence to determine whether the security requirement has been satisfied or other than satisfied. A finding of satisfied indicates that the assessment objective has been met, producing a fully acceptable result. A finding of other than satisfied indicates that there are potential anomalies that may need to be addressed by the organization. A finding of other than satisfied may also indicate that the assessor was unable to obtain sufficient information to make the determination called for in the determination statement.\n\n## 2.2.

A finding of other than satisfied may also indicate that the assessor was unable to obtain sufficient information to make the determination called for in the determination statement.\n\n## 2.2. Assurance Cases\n\nBuilding an effective assurance case to determine compliance with security requirements involves compiling evidence from a variety of sources and conducting different types of activities during an assessment. An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into an argument demonstrating that some claim about a system is true. For security assessments conducted using the procedures in this publication, that claim is \"compliance\" with the security requirements in SP 800-171. Assessors obtain evidence during security assessments to allow designated officials to make objective determinations about compliance with the security requirements. The evidence needed to make such determinations can be obtained from various sources, including independent, third-party assessments or other types of assessments, depending on the needs of the organization establishing the requirements and the organization conducting the assessments.\n\nFor example, many technical security requirements are satisfied by security capabilities that are built into commercial information technology products and systems. Product assessments are typically conducted by independent, third-party testing organizations. These assessments# Examine the Security Functions of Products\n\nExamine the security functions of products and established configuration settings. Assessments can also be conducted to demonstrate compliance with industry, national, or international security standards as well as developer and vendor claims. Since many information technology products are assessed by commercial testing organizations and then subsequently deployed in hundreds of thousands of systems, these types of assessments can be carried out at a greater level of depth and provide deeper insights into the security capabilities of the products.\n\nThe evidence needed to determine compliance with the security requirements is obtained by assessing the implementation of the safeguards and countermeasures selected to satisfy the requirements. Assessors can build on previously developed materials that started with the specification of the information security needs of the organization and were further improved during the design, development, and implementation of the system. These materials provide the initial evidence for an assurance case.",

The assessors or assessment teams bring available information about the system together, such as the results of component product assessments. The assessors can conduct additional system-level assessments using the assessment methods and procedures contained in this publication and the implementation information provided by the nonfederal organization in its system security plan. Assessments can be used to compile and evaluate the evidence needed by organizations to help determine the effectiveness of the safeguards implemented to protect CUI, the actions needed to mitigate security risks to the organization, and compliance with the security requirements.\n\nThe assessment procedures in this publication are based on and sourced to the assessment procedures in SP 800-53A [5].

The Procedures\n\nThis section provides assessment procedures for the security requirements defined in NIST SP 800-171 [3]. Organizations that conduct security requirement assessments can develop their security assessment plans by using the information provided in the assessment procedures and selecting the specific assessment methods and objects that meet the organization's needs.
