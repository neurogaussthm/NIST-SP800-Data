Introduction The security assessment process gathers information and produces evidence to determine the effectiveness of security requirements by: • Identifying potential problems or shortfalls in security and risk management programs • Identifying security weaknesses and deficiencies in systems and the environments in which those systems operate • Prioritizing risk mitigation decisions and activities • Confirming that identified security weaknesses and deficiencies in the system and environment of operation have been addressed • Supporting continuous monitoring activities and providing information security situational awareness 1.1. Purpose and Applicability The purpose of this publication is to provide procedures for assessing the security requirements in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations . Organizations can use the assessment procedures to generate evidence that the security requirements have been satisfied. The scope of the security assessments conducted using the procedures described in this publication is guided and informed by the system security plans for systems that process, store, or transmit CUI. The assessment procedures offer the flexibility to customize assessments based on organizational policies and requirements, known threat and vulnerability information, system and platform dependencies, operational considerations, and tolerance for risk.1 1.2. Organization of This Publication The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows: • Section 2 describes the fundamental concepts associated with assessments of security requirements, including assessment procedures, methods, objects, and assurance cases that can be created using the evidence produced during assessments. • Section 3 provides assessment procedures for the security requirements in SP 800-171, including assessment objectives and potential assessment methods and objects for each procedure. 1 The term risk refers to risks to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. See SP 800-39  for additional information on organizational risk management and risk tolerance. 1NIST SP 800-171Ar3 Assessing CUI Security Requirements May 2024 The following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI: • References • Appendix A: Acronyms • Appendix B: Glossary • Appendix C: Security Requirement Assessments • Appendix D: Organization-Defined Parameters • Appendix E: Change Log The contents of this publication can be used for many different assessment-related purposes to determine organizational compliance with the security requirements. The broad range of potential assessment methods and objects listed in this publication does not necessarily reflect and should not be directly associated with actual compliance or noncompliance. Rather, the selection of specific assessment methods and objects from the list provided can help generate a picture of overall compliance with the security requirements. There is no expectation about the number of methods or objects needed to determine compliance with the security requirements. Moreover, the entire list of potential assessment objects should not be viewed as required artifacts needed to determine compliance. Organizations have the flexibility to determine the specific methods and objects sufficient to obtain the needed evidence to support any claims of compliance. 2NIST SP 800-171Ar3 Assessing CUI Security Requirements May 2024 2. The Fundamentals The process used by organizations and assessors to assess the security requirements in SP 800- 171  includes (1) preparing for the assessment, (2) developing a security assessment plan, (3) conducting the assessment, and (4) documenting, analyzing, and reporting the assessment results.2 The remainder of this section describes the structure and content of the procedures used to assess the security requirements and the importance of assurance cases in providing the evidence necessary to determine compliance with the requirements. 2.1. Assessment Procedures The security requirements in SP 800-171 are organized into 17 families, as illustrated in Table 1. The assessment procedures in Sec. 3 are grouped by similar family designations to ensure the completeness and consistency of assessments. The procedures have been derived from the assessment procedures in SP 800-53A . Table 1. Security Requirement Families Access Control Maintenance Security Assessment and Monitoring Awareness and Training Media Protection System and Communications Protection Audit and Accountability Personnel Security System and Information Integrity Configuration Management Physical Protection Planning Identification and Authentication Risk Assessment System and Services Acquisition Incident Response Supply Chain Risk Management An assessment procedure consists of an assessment objective and a set of potential assessment methods and objects that can be used to conduct the assessment. Each potential assessment objective includes a determination statement related to the security requirement. If there is an organization-defined parameter (ODP) in the security requirement, then the assessment objective begins with a determination statement related to the definition of the ODP. The determination statements are linked to the content of the security requirements to help ensure traceability of the assessment results to the requirements. Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and can include specifications, mechanisms, activities, and individuals. Specifications are the documented artifacts3 (e.g., plans, policies, procedures, requirements, functional and assurance specifications, design documentation, and architectures) associated with a system. Mechanisms are the hardware, software, and firmware safeguards implemented within a system. Activities are the protection- related actions supporting a system that involve people (e.g., conducting system backup 2 SP 800-53A  provides additional information on the assessment process and the individuals steps listed above. 3 Artifacts may be in formats other than documents (e.g., databases, Governance, Risk, and Compliance [GRC] tools, or Open Security Controls Assessment Language [OSCAL]). 3NIST SP 800-171Ar3 Assessing CUI Security Requirements May 2024 operations, exercising an incident response plan, and monitoring network traffic). Individuals are the people applying the specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above. Assessment methods define the nature and extent of the assessor’s actions and are used to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The assessment methods include examine, interview, and test. The examine method is the process of reviewing, studying, inspecting, or analyzing assessment objects. The interview method is the process of holding discussions with individuals or groups about assessment objects. The test method is the process of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities, mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior. Assessment methods include attributes of depth and coverage, which define the rigor, scope, and level of effort for the assessment as well as the degree of assurance that the security requirements have been satisfied. See SP 800-53A, Appendix C, Assessment Method Descriptions . The structure and content of an assessment procedure are provided in the example below: 03.01.06 Least Privilege – Privileged Accounts Security Requirement Name ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE Multi-Part Determination Statement and ODP for Security Requirement Determine if: A.03.01.06.ODP: personnel or roles to which privileged accounts on the system are to be restricted are defined. A.03.01.06.a: privileged accounts on the system are restricted to <A.03.01.06.ODP: personnel or roles>. A.03.01.06.b: users (or roles) with privileged accounts are required to use non-privileged accounts when accessing non-security functions or non-security information. ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS Examine [SELECT FROM: access control policy and procedures; procedures for least privilege; list of system-generated privileged accounts; list of system administration personnel; system audit records; system configuration settings; system security plan; list of system-generated security functions or security-relevant information assigned to system accounts or roles; other relevant documents or records] Interview [SELECT FROM: personnel with responsibilities for defining least privileges; personnel with information security responsibilities; system administrators] Test [SELECT FROM: mechanisms for implementing least privilege functions] REFERENCES Source Assessment Procedures: AC-06(02), AC-06(05) 4NIST SP 800-171Ar3 Assessing CUI Security Requirements May 2024 Determination statements have alphanumeric identifiers. Each determination statement begins with the letter “A” to indicate that it is part of an assessment procedure. The next sequence of numbers or letters (e.g., 03.01.01.e or 03.01.01.f.02) indicates the security requirement identifier from NIST SP 800-171 (and the specific control item if it is a multi-part requirement) that is the target of the assessment. Organization-defined parameters are indicated by the letters “ODP.” If there are multiple ODPs in the determination statement, the ODP number is indicated in a square bracket (e.g., A.03.01.08.ODP). Square brackets are also used to denote when an assessment procedure further decomposes a requirement into more granular determination statements (e.g., A.03.01.12.a, A.03.01.12.a, A.03.01.12.a). The application of an assessment procedure to a security requirement produces assessment results or findings. The findings are compiled and used as evidence to determine whether the security requirement has been satisfied or other than satisfied. A finding of satisfied indicates that the assessment objective has been met, producing a fully acceptable result. A finding of other than satisfied indicates that there are potential anomalies that may need to be addressed by the organization. A finding of other than satisfied may also indicate that the assessor was unable to obtain sufficient information to make the determination called for in the determination statement. 2.2. Assurance Cases Building an effective assurance case to determine compliance with security requirements involves compiling evidence from a variety of sources and conducting different types of activities during an assessment. An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into an argument demonstrating that some claim about a system is true. For security assessments conducted using the procedures in this publication, that claim is “compliance” with the security requirements in SP 800-171. Assessors obtain evidence during security assessments to allow designated officials4 to make objective determinations about compliance with the security requirements. The evidence needed to make such determinations can be obtained from various sources, including independent, third-party assessments or other types of assessments, depending on the needs of the organization establishing the requirements and the organization conducting the assessments. For example, many technical security requirements are satisfied by security capabilities that are built into commercial information technology products and systems. Product assessments are typically conducted by independent, third-party testing organizations.5 These assessments examine the security functions of products and established configuration settings. Assessments can also be conducted to demonstrate compliance with industry, national, or international security standards as well as developer and vendor claims. Since many information technology 4 A designated official is an official, either internal or external to a nonfederal organization, with the responsibility to determine organizational compliance with the security requirements. 5 Examples of third-party testing organizations include Common Criteria Testing Laboratories that evaluate IT products in accordance with ISO/IEC 15408  and Cryptographic Module Validation Program Testing Laboratories that evaluate cryptographic modules in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 . 5NIST SP 800-171Ar3 Assessing CUI Security Requirements May 2024 products are assessed by commercial testing organizations and then subsequently deployed in hundreds of thousands of systems, these types of assessments can be carried out at a greater level of depth and provide deeper insights into the security capabilities of the products. The evidence needed to determine compliance with the security requirements is obtained by assessing the implementation of the safeguards and countermeasures selected to satisfy the requirements. Assessors can build on previously developed materials that started with the specification of the information security needs of the organization and were further improved during the design, development, and implementation of the system. These materials provide the initial evidence for an assurance case. Assessments can be conducted by system developers, system integrators, auditors, system owners, or the security staffs of organizations. The assessors or assessment teams bring available information about the system together, such as the results of component product assessments. The assessors can conduct additional system-level assessments using the assessment methods and procedures contained in this publication and the implementation information provided by the nonfederal organization in its system security plan. Assessments can be used to compile and evaluate the evidence needed by organizations to help determine the effectiveness of the safeguards implemented to protect CUI, the actions needed to mitigate security risks to the organization, and compliance with the security requirements. The assessment procedures in this publication are based on and sourced to the assessment procedures in SP 800-53A .

The Procedures This section provides assessment procedures for the security requirements defined in NIST SP 800-171 . Organizations that conduct security requirement assessments can develop their security assessment plans by using the information provided in the assessment procedures and selecting the specific assessment methods and objects that meet the organization’s needs. Organizations also have flexibility in defining the level of rigor and detail associated with the assessment based on the assurance requirements of the organization. 3.1.

Security Requirement Assessment This appendix provides an overview of the process for assessing the security requirements in SP 800-171 . The four-phase process is based on the methodology in SP 800-53A 6 and includes: • Preparing for assessments • Developing assessment plans • Conducting assessments • Analyzing, documenting, and reporting assessment results C.1. Preparing for Assessments Thorough preparation by the organization and assessors is an important aspect of conducting an effective assessment. Preparatory activities address a range of issues relating to the cost, schedule, and conduct of the assessment. From an organizational perspective, preparing for an assessment includes the following activities: • Ensuring that appropriate policies that cover the assessment are in place and understood by affected organizational elements • Establishing the objective and scope of the assessment (i.e., the purpose of the assessment and what is being assessed) • Notifying appropriate organizational officials of the impending assessment and allocating the necessary resources to carry out the assessment • Establishing appropriate communication channels among organizational officials with an interest in the assessment • Establishing the time frame for completing the assessment and the key milestone decision points required by the organization • Identifying and selecting the assessors who will be responsible for conducting the assessment and considering issues of assessor independence • Providing artifacts to the assessors (e.g., policies, procedures, plans, specifications, designs, records, administrator/operator manuals, information exchange agreements, system documentation, previous assessment results, legal requirements) • Establishing a mechanism between the organization and the assessors to minimize ambiguities or misunderstandings about the security requirements, implementation issues, and deficiencies identified during the assessment 6 For additional detail and guidance, see SP 800-53A, Section 3. 103NIST SP 800-171Ar3 Assessing CUI Security Requirements May 2024 Assessors begin preparing for the assessment by: • Developing a general understanding of the organization’s operations and how the scope of the assessment supports those organizational operations • Understanding the structure of the system (i.e., the system architecture) and the security requirements being assessed • Meeting with organizational officials to ensure that there is a common understanding of the assessment objectives and the proposed rigor and scope of the assessment • Obtaining the artifacts needed for the assessment (e.g., policies, procedures, plans, specifications, administrator/operator manuals, system documentation, information exchange agreements, designs, records, previous assessment results7) • Establishing organizational points of contact to carry out the assessment Table 2 provides a summary of the purpose and expected outcomes of the assessment preparation phase. Table 2. Summary of Assessment Preparation Phase Address a range of issues pertaining to the cost, schedule, scope, and conduct of PURPOSE the assessment. • The objective, scope, and time frame of the assessment are determined. OUTCOMES • Key organizational stakeholders are notified, and the necessary resources are allocated. • Assessors are identified and selected. • Artifacts are collected and provided to assessors. • Mechanisms to minimize ambiguities and misunderstandings about the security requirements, implementation issues, and weaknesses/deficiencies identified during the assessment are established. • The organization’s operations, structure, objective, scope, and time frame of assessment are understood by assessors. C.2. Developing Assessment Plans The assessment plan establishes the objectives for the security requirement assessment and a detailed roadmap of how to conduct the assessment based on the system security plan. The following steps are considered by assessors when developing an assessment plan: • Determine which security requirements are to be included in the assessment based on the contents of the system security plan and the purpose and scope of the assessment. • Select the appropriate assessment procedures. 7 Previous assessment results that may be reused for the current assessment include Inspector General reports, audits, vulnerability scans, physical security inspections, developmental testing and evaluation, vendor flaw remediation activities, and ISO 15408  evaluations. 104NIST SP 800-171Ar3 Assessing CUI Security Requirements May 2024 • Tailor the selected assessment procedures (e.g., select appropriate assessment methods and objects, and assign depth and coverage attribute values).8 • Optimize the assessment procedures to reduce the duplication of effort (e.g., sequence and consolidate assessment procedures) and provide a cost-effective assessment solution. • Finalize the assessment plan, and obtain the necessary approvals to execute the plan. Table 3 provides a summary of the purpose and expected outcomes of the assessment plan development phase. Table 3. Summary of Assessment Plan Development Phase Establish the objectives for the security requirement assessment and a detailed PURPOSE roadmap of how to conduct the assessment based on the system security plan. • Security requirements to be included in the assessment are determined. OUTCOMES • Assessment procedures are selected and tailored. • Assessment procedures are optimized to reduce the duplication of effort. • The assessment plan is finalized, and organizational approvals are obtained. C.3. Conducting Assessments After the assessment plan is approved by the organization, the assessors execute the plan in accordance with the agreed-upon schedule. Assessment objectives are achieved by applying the designated assessment methods to selected assessment objects and compiling or producing the evidence necessary to make the determination associated with each assessment objective. Each determination statement contained within an assessment procedure executed by an assessor produces one of the following findings: • Satisfied or • Other than satisfied. A finding of satisfied indicates that the assessment objective for the security requirement (or subset of the requirement) addressed by the determination statement has been met and produced an acceptable result. A finding of other than satisfied indicates that the assessment objective for the requirement has not been met and has produced an unacceptable result. A finding of other than satisfied may also indicate that the assessor was unable to obtain sufficient information to make the determination called for in the determination statement. 8 In addition to selecting assessment methods and objects, each assessment method (i.e., examine, interview, and test) is associated with depth and coverage attributes. The attribute values identify the rigor (depth) and scope (coverage) of the assessment procedures executed by the assessor. The depth and coverage attribute values are associated with the assurance requirements specified by the organization. SP 800-53A, Appendix C provides additional guidance on depth and coverage attributes. 105NIST SP 800-171Ar3 Assessing CUI Security Requirements May 2024 Table 4 provides a summary of the purpose and expected outcomes of the assessment execution phase. Table 4. Summary of Assessment Execution Phase Conduct the assessment in accordance with the assessment plan, and document PURPOSE the results in an assessment report. • Security requirements are assessed in accordance with the assessment plan. OUTCOMES • An assessment report that documents whether the security requirements have been satisfied is produced. C.4. Analyzing, Documenting, and Reporting Assessment Results The assessment report includes information from assessors (in the form of findings) that is necessary to determine whether the security requirements in SP 800-171 have been satisfied.9 The report conveys the results of the assessment to designated organizational officials. The report can also provide recommendations for correcting any deficiencies discovered during the assessment. Depending on the organization’s objective for the assessment, the assessment results can trigger a variety of risk response actions, including risk acceptance, risk mitigation, risk rejection, risk transfer, or risk sharing. The assessment results can also influence changes to the system security plan and plan of action and milestones. Table 5 provides a summary of the purpose and expected outcomes of the assessment analysis, documentation, and reporting phase. Table 5. Summary of Assessment Analysis, Documentation, and Reporting Phase Analyze the risks that result from the weaknesses and deficiencies identified PURPOSE during the assessment, and determine an approach to respond to those risks in accordance with organizational priorities. • Assessment findings are reviewed and analyzed. OUTCOMES • Subsequent risk responses are initiated to manage risks. • The system security plan and plan of action and milestones are updated to reflect the results of the assessment and any subsequent risk response actions. 9 SP 800-53A, Appendix E provides additional guidance on security assessment reports. 106NIST SP 800-171Ar3 Assessing CUI Security Requirements May 2024 Appendix D.
