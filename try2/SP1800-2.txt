The integration of these products provides a converged view of all users within the electric utility’s operational technology (OT) systems and information technology (IT) systems, as well as access to buildings and other facilities. ▪ The example solution is packaged as a “How-To” guide that demonstrates the implementation of standards-based cybersecurity technologies in the real world. The guide can help organizations to gain efficiencies in access management, while saving them research and proof-of-concept costs. CHALLENGE As the electric power industry upgrades infrastructure to adopt emerging technologies, utilities are also increasing OT and IT convergence. This allows more technologies, devices, and systems to connect to the grid to improve efficiency, provide access to data often held in silos, and enhance productivity. This convergence challenges OT and IT departments to efficiently and effectively manage identities and access. Many utilities run identity and access management (IdAM) systems that are fragmented and controlled by numerous departments. Several negative outcomes can result: a lack of overall traceability and accountability regarding who has access to both critical and noncritical assets, an increased risk of attack and service disruption, and an inability to identify potential sources of a problem or attack. To better protect power generation, transmission, and distribution, electric utilities need to be able to control and secure access to their resources, including OT systems, buildings, equipment, and IT systems. IdAM systems for these assets often exist in silos, and employees who manage these systems lack methods to effectively coordinate access to devices and facilities across these silos. This inefficient process can result in security risks for electric utilities, according to our electric sector stakeholders. In collaboration with experts from the energy sector (mainly electric power companies) and those who provide equipment and services to them, we developed a scenario to describe a security challenge based on normal day-to-day business operations. The scenario centers on a utility technician with access to several substations and to remote terminal units that are connected to the utility’s network in those substations. If the technician moves out of the region and resigns, a consolidated IdAM system can quickly and consistently remove the technician’s access to all facilities and systems. This provides the timely management of access and reduces the potential for errors. Electric utilities need this ability to provide the right person with the right degree of access to the right resources at the right time. NIST SP 1800-2A: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 1 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2SOLUTION To help the energy sector address this challenge, we developed an example solution that electric utilities can use to more securely and efficiently manage access to the networked devices and facilities on which power generation, transmission, and distribution depend. Our solution uses commercially available products to demonstrate a converged IdAM platform, providing a comprehensive view of users across all of the entity’s business and utility operations silos, and the access rights granted to those users. This platform is described in this NIST cybersecurity Identity and Access Management practice guide. Electric utilities can use some or all of the guide to implement a converged IdAM system by referencing related NIST guidance and industry standards, including NERC CIP Version 5. Commercial, standards- based products, like the ones that we used, are easily available and interoperable with commonly used IT infrastructure and investments. In our lab at the NCCoE, which is part of NIST, we built an environment that simulates an electric utility’s architecture. This architecture includes the typical technology silos found in a utility (such as operational technology, IT, and physical access control systems). The practice guide includes three versions of an end-to-end identity management solution that provides access control capabilities to reduce opportunities for cyber attack or human error. It accounts for the risks that converged control can present. In this guide, we show how an electric utility can implement a converged IdAM platform, using multiple commercially available products, to provide a comprehensive view of all users within the electric utility, across all silos, and of the access rights that they have been granted. The guide: ▪ maps security characteristics to guidance and best practices from NIST and other standards organizations, including NERC CIP Version 5 standards ▪ provides a detailed example solution with capabilities that address security controls, and demonstrates a modular approach that uses different products to achieve the same results ▪ includes instructions for implementers and security engineers, including examples of all of the necessary components and installation, configuration, and integration ▪ uses products that are readily available and interoperable with your existing IT infrastructure and investments ▪ can meet the needs of electric utilities of all sizes, including corporate and regional business offices, power generation plants, and substations While the NCCoE used a suite of commercial products to address this challenge, this guide does not endorse these particular products, nor does it guarantee compliance with any regulatory initiatives. Your organization’s information security experts should identify the products that will best integrate with your existing tools and IT system infrastructure. Your organization can adopt this solution or one that adheres to these guidelines in whole, or you can use this guide as a starting point for tailoring and implementing parts of a solution.

To protect power generation, transmission, and distribution, energy companies need to control physical P 1. and logical access to their resources, including buildings, equipment, information technology (IT), and 8 0 0 operational technology (OT). They must authenticate authorized individuals to the devices and facilities - 2 . to which the companies are giving access rights with a high degree of certainty. In addition, they need to enforce access-control policies (e.g., allow, deny, inquire further) consistently, uniformly, and quickly across all of their resources. This project resulted from direct dialog among NCCoE staff and members of the electricity subsector, mainly from electric power companies and those who provide equipment and/or services to them. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a converged, standards-based technical approach that unifies identity and access management (IdAM) functions across OT networks, physical access control systems (PACS), and IT systems. These networks often operate independently, which can result in identity and access information disparity, increased costs, inefficiencies, and a loss of capacity and service delivery capability. Also, these networks support different infrastructures, each with unique security risks. The converged IdAM solution must be constructed to effectively address the highest-risk infrastructure. This guide describes our collaborative efforts with technology providers and NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities iielectric-company stakeholders to address the security challenges that energy providers face in the core function of IdAM. This guide offers a technical approach to meeting the challenge and also incorporates a business-value mindset by identifying the strategic considerations involved in implementing new technologies. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide provides a modular, open, end-to-end example solution that can be tailored and implemented by energy providers of varying sizes and levels of IT sophistication. It shows energy providers how we met the challenge by using open-source and commercially available tools and technologies that are consistent with cybersecurity standards. The T h use-case scenario is based on a normal day-to-day business operational scenario that provides the si p underlying impetus for the functionality presented in this guide. While the reference solution was u b cil demonstrated with a certain suite of products, this guide does not endorse these specific products. ta Instead, this guide presents the characteristics and capabilities that an organization’s security experts oi n can use to identify similar standards-based products that can be integrated quickly and cost-effectively si a with an energy provider’s existing tools and infrastructure. v a ali KEYWORDS b el r f cyber, physical, and operational security; cybersecurity; electricity subsector; energy sector; identity and e e o access management; information technology f c h a ACKNOWLEDGMENTS r g e f We are grateful to the following individuals for their generous contributions of expertise and time. r o m h : Name Organization t t p //: Jasvir Gill AlertEnterprise d o o.i Srini Kakkera AlertEnterprise r g / Srinivas Adepu AlertEnterprise 1 0 6.

The How-To guide provides specific product installation, configuration, and 0 2 integration instructions for implementing the example solution. We do not recreate the product 8 N/ manufacturers’ documentation, which is generally widely available. Rather, we show how we SI incorporated the products together in our environment to create an example solution. T S. P 1. This guide assumes that IT professionals have experience implementing security products within the 8 0 enterprise. While we have used a suite of commercial products to address this challenge, this guide does 0 - 2 not endorse these particular products. Your organization can adopt this solution or one that adheres to . these guidelines in whole, or you can use this guide as a starting point for tailoring and implementing parts of a solution for OT systems, PACSs, and IT systems. Your organization’s security experts should identify the products that will best integrate with your existing tools and IT system infrastructure. We hope you will seek products that are congruent with applicable standards and best practices. Section 4.5, Technologies, lists the products we used and maps them to the cybersecurity controls provided by this reference solution.

As we P 1. developed the original problem statement, or use case, on which this project is based, we consulted 8 0 with electric-company chief information officers, chief information security officers, security 0 - 2 management personnel, and others with financial decision-making responsibility (particularly for . security). The individuals that we consulted told us that they need to control physical and logical access to their resources, including buildings, environmental applications, energy management system (EMS) control and data centers, equipment, IT, and OT systems. They need to authenticate only designated individuals and devices to which they are giving access rights. In addition, they need to enforce access-control NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 5policies (e.g., allow, deny, inquire further) consistently, uniformly, and quickly across all of their resources. Current IdAM implementations can often be fragmented and controlled by numerous departments within an electric utility or by individual equipment owners. Several negative outcomes can result from this situation: an increased risk of attack and service disruption, an inability to identify potential sources of a problem or attack, and a lack of overall traceability and accountability regarding who has access to both critical and noncritical assets. While the example solution presented here is motivated by a problem identified by electric utilities, it can be adapted to utilities that have multiple OT T h si silos, such as utilities that handle electric and water, or electric and gas. Another key consideration is the p u need for companies to demonstrate compliance with industry standards and/or government b cil regulations. a t oi n We, at NCCoE, constructed two versions of an end-to-end identity management solution that provides a si access-control capabilities across the OT, PACS, and IT networks. We used the same approach for each v a build, in that we only interchanged two core products that contained the same functionality and ali b capability. Section 5.3.1 and Section 5.3.2 detail these two example solutions. Our build collaborator, el f AlertEnterprise, independently constructed a third version of the solution; Section 5.5 details this r e e solution. The end result is that a user’s access to facilities and devices can be provisioned from a single o f console. Access privileges can be modified by adding new users and assigning access for the first time, c h modifying existing user access privileges, or disabling user access privileges. Our goal was to provide the a r eg electricity subsector with a solution that addresses the key tenet of cybersecurity—access f r management/rights—based on the principle of least privilege, which is defined as providing the least o m amount of access (to systems) necessary for the user to complete his or her job . h : t t p /: 4 Approach / d o o.i r 4.1 Audience g / 1 0 6. This guide is intended for technology practitioners (including those focused on OT, IT, and 0 2 telecommunications) who are responsible for implementing security solutions in electricity subsector 8 N/ organizations. SI T PS. 4.2 Scope 1. 8 0 This project began with a detailed discussion between NCCoE and members of the electricity subsector 0 - 2 community, about their main security challenges. The risk of unauthorized access to facilities and . devices, and the inability to verify if user access had been properly established, modified, or revoked, quickly became the focus of the discussion. In response, the NCCoE drafted a use case that identified numerous desired solution characteristics. After an open call in the Federal Register, we chose technology collaborators based on their ability to provide these characteristics. In the scope, we initially thought that it would be feasible to include NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 6federated identity management services , or “arrangement[s] that can be made among multiple enterprises that lets subscribers use the same identification data to obtain access to the networks of all enterprises in the group.” As we progressed through the initial stages of solution development, we realized that access, authentication, and authorization through federated identity means would vastly increase the amount of time needed to complete a build. We narrowed the scope to providing identity management of energy company employees, including a converged provisioning capability to the OT, PACS, and IT networks. The scope became successful execution of the following provisioning functions: T h si p 1. enabling access for a new employee u b cil 2. modifying access for an existing employee a t oi 3. disabling access for a former employee n a si The objective is to perform all three actions from a single interface that can serve as the authoritative v a source for all access managed within an energy provider’s facilities, networks, and systems. ali b el f 4.3 Assumptions r e e o This project is guided by the assumptions identified in the following subsections. f c h ra 4.3.1 Security g e f All network and system changes have the potential to increase the attack surface within an enterprise. r o m In Section 4.4, Risk Assessment, we provide detailed recommendations on how to secure this reference h : solution. t t p /: / 4.3.2 Modularity d o o.i This example solution is made of many commercially available parts. You might swap one of the r g products that we used for a product that is better suited for your environment. We also assume that you / 1 0 already have some IdAM solutions in place. A combination of some of the components described here, 6. 0 or a single component, can improve your identity and access/authorization functions, without requiring 2 8 / you to remove or replace your existing infrastructure. This guide provides both a complete end-to-end N SI solution and options that you can implement based on your needs. T S. P 1. 4.3.3 Human Resources Database/Identity Vetting 8 0 0 This build is based on a simulated environment. Rather than recreate a human resources (HR) database - 2 . and the entire identity vetting process in our lab, we assumed that your organization has the processes, databases, and other components necessary to establish a valid identity. 4.3.4 Identity Federation We initially intended to work with energy providers to demonstrate a means for sharing selected identity information across organizational boundaries. While we assumed that the NCCoE could NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 7implement some type of identity federation mechanism to authenticate and authorize individuals who are both internal and external to the organization, this capability exceeded the scope of the build. 4.3.5 Technical Implementation This guide is written from a “how-to” perspective. Its foremost purpose is to provide details on how to install, configure, and integrate components. We assume that an energy provider has the technical resources to implement all or parts of the build or has access to companies that can perform the T h si implementation on its behalf. p u b cil 4.3.6 Limited Scalability Testing a oit We did not attempt to replicate the user-base size that would be found at medium and large energy n si providers. We do not identify scalability thresholds in our IdAM builds, as those depend on the type and a size of the implementation and are particular to the individual enterprise. v a ali b 4.3.7 Replication of Enterprise Network el f r We were able to replicate the three silos: (1) PACS, (2) IT or corporate networks, and (3) the OT network, e e o in a limited manner. The goal was to demonstrate, both logically and physically, that provisioning f c functions could be performed from a converged IdAM system, regardless of its location in the h a r enterprise. In a real-world environment, the interconnections between the OT, PACS, and IT silos g e f depend on the business needs and compliance requirements of the enterprise. We did not attempt to r o m replicate these interconnections. Rather, we acknowledge that implementing our build or its h : components creates new interfaces across silos. We focused on providing general information on how t pt to remain within the bounds of compliance, should you adopt this example solution. In addition, we /: / provide guidance on how to mitigate any new risks introduced to the environment. d o o.i gr 4.4 Risk Assessment / 1 0 6. We performed two types of risk assessment: the initial analysis of the risk posed to the electricity 0 2 subsector as a whole, which led to the creation of the use case and the desired security characteristics, 8 / N and an analysis to show users how to manage the cybersecurity risk to the components introduced by SI T the adoption of the solution. S. P 1. 8 4.4.1 Assessing Risk Posture 0 0 - NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems  states, “Risk is the 2 . net negative impact of the exercise of a vulnerability, considering both the probability and the impact of occurrence. Risk management is the process of identifying risk, assessing risk, and taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level.” The NCCoE recommends that any discussion of risk management, particularly at the enterprise level, begin with a comprehensive review of the NIST SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems  material available to the public. The risk management framework (RMF) guidance as a whole proved invaluable in giving us a NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 8baseline to assess risks, from which we developed the project, the security characteristics of the build, and this guide. Using the guidance in NIST’s series of publications concerning the RMF, we performed two key activities to identify the most-compelling risks encountered by energy providers. The first was a face-to-face meeting with members of the energy community to define the main security risks to business operations. This meeting identified a primary risk concern—the lack of converged IdAM services, T h particularly on OT networks. We then identified the core risk area, IdAM, and established the core si p operational risks encountered daily in this area. We deemed the tactical risks to be as follows: u b cil ▪ lack of authentication, authorization, and access-control requirements for all OT in the a oit electricity subsector n si ▪ inability to manage and log authentication, authorization, and access-control information for all a v OT using converged or federated controls a ali b ▪ inability to centrally monitor authorized and unauthorized use of all OT and user accounts el r f ▪ inability to provision, modify, or revoke access throughout the enterprise (including OT) in a e e o timely manner f c h Our second key activity was conducting phone interviews with members of the electricity subsector. a gr These interviews gave us a better understanding of the actual business risks, as they relate to the e f potential cost and business value. NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk , focuses r o m particularly on the business aspect of risk, namely at the enterprise level. This foundation is essential for h : any further risk analysis, risk response/mitigation, and risk monitoring activities. A summary of the t t p strategic risks is provided below: /: / d o ▪ impact on service delivery: Ensuring that people have access to the systems needed to perform o.i r their job functions, and do not have access to the systems not needed to perform their job g 1/ functions, reduces the risk of inappropriate or unauthorized use of access to affect availability. 0 6. 0 ▪ cost of implementation: Implementing IdAM once, and using it across all systems, may reduce 2 8 both system development costs and operational costs. / N SI ▪ budget expenditure, as it relates to investment in security technologies T S. P ▪ projected cost savings and operational efficiencies to be gained as a result of new investment in 1. 8 security 0 0 - 2 ▪ compliance with existing industry standards: NERC CIP Version 5 requires deliberate and timely . control of both logical and physical access to assets. ▪ high-quality reputation or public image ▪ risk of alternative or no action ▪ successful precedents NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 9Undertaking these activities in accordance with the NIST RMF guidance yielded the necessary operational and strategic risk information, which we subsequently translated to security characteristics. We mapped these characteristics to the NIST SP 800-53 Revision4  controls, where applicable, along with other applicable industry and mainstream security standards. 4.4.2 Managing Security Risk from Converged IdAM As mentioned previously, a foundation of cybersecurity is the principle of least privilege, defined as T h si providing the least amount of access (to systems) necessary for the user to complete his or her job . p u To enforce this principle, the access-control system needs to know the appropriate privileges for each b cil user and system. An analysis of the IdAM solution reveals two components that need to be protected a oit from both external and internal threat actors: the central identity and authorization store and the n si authorization workflow management system. The authorization workflow management system is a trusted to make changes to the central identity and authorization store. Therefore, any inappropriate or v a ali unauthorized use of these systems could change authorization levels for anyone in the enterprise. If that b el occurred, the enterprise would experience a lack of integrity of the identity and authentication stores. r f The central identity and authorization store is the authoritative source for the enterprise and holds the e e o hash for each user password, as well as the authorizations associated with each user. Access to this f c information would enable an unauthorized user to impersonate anyone in the organization. In this h a r situation, the enterprise would lose control over access to resources. Security controls to mitigate this g e f risk are discussed in Section 5.9.5.1.1. r o m To protect the build components, we implemented the following requirements in our lab environment: h : t access control, data security, and protective technology. Section 5.9 provides a security evaluation of t p /: the example solution and a list of the security characteristics. Please note that we addressed only the / d o core requirements appropriate for the IdAM build. o.i r g / 4.4.3 Risk 1 0 6. While risk is addressed in current industry standards, such as NERC CIP Version 5, our sector 0 2 stakeholders told us about additional risk considerations at both the operational and strategic levels. 8 / N SI Operationally, a lack of a converged IdAM platform can increase the risk of people gaining unauthorized T S. access to critical infrastructure components. Once unauthorized access is gained, the risk surface P 1. increases and the opportunity for the introduction of additional threats to the environment, such as 8 0 0 malware and denial of service (especially oriented toward OT), is realized. - 2 . At the strategic level, you might consider the cost of mitigating these risks and the potential return on your investment in implementing a product (or multiple products). You may also want to assess if a converged IdAM system can help enhance the productivity of employees and speed delivery of services and explore if it can help support oversight of resources, including IT, personnel, and data. This example solution also addresses imminent operational security risks and incorporates strategic risk considerations. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 10Adopting any new technology can introduce new risks to your enterprise. We understand that this example solution to mitigate the risks of fragmented IdAM may, in turn, introduce new risks. By converging IdAM functions, we decrease the risk that inconsistencies, errors, and omissions across multiple, independent IdAM systems can be used to gain unauthorized access to networked devices. We recognize, however, that converging IdAM functions provides a point of single infiltration of multiple critical systems (OT, PACS, and IT). We address this key risk in detail in Section 5.9.5.1, and provide a comprehensive list of mitigations in Section 5.9.6. T h si up 4.4.4 Security Control Map b cil As explained in Section 4.3.1, we derived the security characteristics through a risk analysis process a oit conducted in collaboration with our electricity subsector stakeholders. This is a critical first step in n si acquiring or developing the capability necessary to mitigate the risks as identified by our stakeholders. a Table 4-1 maps the desired security characteristics and example capabilities of the use case to the v a ali Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, also known as the NIST Cybersecurity b el Framework (CSF); relevant NIST standards; industry standards; and controls and best practices. f r e e o f c h a r g e f r o m h : t t p /: / d o o.i r g / 1 0 6. 0 2 8 / N SI T S.

It encompasses the processes and technologies by which individuals T are identified, vetted, credentialed, and authorized access to resources, and held accountable for their h p si use of these resources. These processes and technologies create digital identity representations of u b people, bind those identities to credentials, and use those credentials to control access to resources. cil IdAM is composed of the capabilities illustrated in Figure 5-1, which are detailed, by number, in the text a t oi that follows. n si a Figure 5-1 IdAM Capabilities v a ali b el f r e e o f c h a r g e f r o m h : t t p //: d o o.i 1. User registration determines that a reason exists to give a person access to resources, r g verifies the person’s identity, and creates one or more digital identities for the person. / 1 0 6. 2. Credential issuance and management provides life-cycle management of credentials, such as 0 2 employee badges or digital certificates. Additional information on credential issuance and 8 / management, as well as authentication, can be found in NIST SP 800-63-2, Electronic N SI Authentication Guideline . T S. P 3. Access rights management determines the resources that a digital identity is allowed to use. 1. 8 0 4. Provisioning populates digital identity, credential, and access rights information for use in 0 - 2 authentication, access control, and audit. . 5. Authentication establishes confidence in a person’s digital identity. 6. Access control allows or denies a digital identity access to a resource. NIST Interagency/Internal Report (NISTIR) 7316, Assessment of Access Control Systems , explains commonly used access-control policies, models, and mechanisms. 7. Audit maintains a record of resource access attempts by a digital identity. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 21The top three capabilities are administrative capabilities, in that they involve human actions or are infrequently used. For example, verifying identity typically involves physically reviewing documents, such as a driver’s license or passport. Credential issuance and management is invoked when an employee is hired, changes jobs, leaves the company, loses a credential, or when a credential expires. The bottom three capabilities are “run-time” capabilities, in that they happen whenever a person accesses a resource. Authentication, access control, and audit are typically automated activities that T h occur every time that a person enters a facility by using a badge, or logs into a computer system. A si p directory, such as Microsoft AD, is often used in the implementation of run-time functions. u b cil Provisioning connects the administrative activities to the run-time activities by providing the run-time a t oi capabilities with the information needed from the administrative activities. n si a In the electricity subsector today, some or all of these IdAM capabilities are frequently replicated at v a least three times—once for a person’s access to OT, again for physical access, and then to access IT. ali b Additionally, these capabilities may be independently replicated for each system within OT or IT. el f Replication makes it difficult to ensure that employees have access to the resources that they need to r e e perform their jobs, and only those resources. Newly hired employees may not have access to all of the o f resources they need. Employees who change jobs may retain access to resources they no longer need. c h a Terminated employees may retain access long after they have left. Further, multiple independent IdAM r g e processes make it difficult to periodically review who has access to what resources. f r o m The example solution described here addresses these problems by creating a converged implementation h : of the IdAM access rights management and provisioning capabilities that is used across OT, PACS, and IT. t t p This converged implementation does not change the run-time capabilities of authentication, access /: / d control, and audit, leaving them replicated and distributed. The converged implementation depends on o o.i a utility’s existing processes, such as employee on-boarding and badge issuance, to provide both user r g registration and credential issuance and management capabilities. Figure 5-2 illustrates the example / 1 0 solution. 6. 0 2 8 / N SI T S. P 1. 8 0 0 - 2 . NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 22Figure 5-2 IdAM Example Solution T h si p u b cil a t oi n si a v a ali b el f r e e o f c h a r g e f r o m h : t The converged IdAM capability implements the following items: t p /: / d ▪ an IdAM workflow to manage the overall process o o.i ▪ an identity store, which is the authoritative source for digital identities and their associated r g / access rights to resources 1 0 6. ▪ a provisioning capability to populate information from the workflow and identity store into the 0 2 run-time capabilities. The provisioning capability is further decomposed into OT provisioning, IT 8 / N provisioning, and PACS provisioning SI T S. Each of the three silos, OT, IT, and PACS, may have its own identity stores that contain digital identities P 1. and access rights for use in controlling access to systems within the silo. Further, some applications in a 8 0 silo may have their own application identity stores that are used by the application to control access to 0 - 2 the information and to the services that it provides. The converged IdAM capability, through . provisioning, manages the information in these other identity stores. The combined capabilities can reduce the time to update access in the OT, PACS, and IT systems from days to minutes. They also improve the audit trail capture by integrating the three audit logs into one. Provisioning may also verify that authorizations stored locally in the run-time capabilities are consistent with those in the identity store. If locally stored authorizations are inconsistent with authoritative values NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 23in the identity store, provisioning may raise an alarm or change locally stored authorizations to be consistent with the identity store. The example solution implements three basic transactions: ▪ creating all required credentials, authorizing access, and provisioning access for a new employee ▪ updating credentials and access for an existing employee who is changing jobs or requires a T temporary access change h si p ▪ destroying credentials and removing accesses for a terminated employee u b cil The IdAM workflow receives information about employees and their jobs from the HR system. For a new a oit employee, HR is responsible for performing initial identity verification. Based on a new employee’s n si assigned job, the IdAM workflow creates one or more digital identities and determines the credentials a and resource accesses required. The workflow triggers credential management capabilities to create v a ali physical identification badges, physical access cards, and any logical access credentials, such as X.509 b el public key certificates, that may be needed. The workflow records information about these credentials f r in the identity store. e e o f The example solution does not assume that each person will have a single digital identity. A current c h a employee is likely to have several distinct digital identities because of independent management of r eg digital identities in physical security, business systems, and operational systems. Requiring a single f or digital identity would create a significant challenge to the adoption of the example solution. m h : Instead, the identity store associates all of an employee’s digital identifiers so that all of the person’s t t p accesses can be managed together. Once the example solution is in place, an organization can continue /: / d issuing multiple digital identifiers to new employees or can assign a single digital identifier that is o o.i common to physical security, business systems, and operational systems. r g / 1 The workflow automatically authorizes some physical and logical accesses that are needed either by all 0 6. employees or for an employee’s job. The workflow stores information about credentials and authorized 0 2 8 accesses in the identity store. The workflow then invokes provisioning to populate silo-specific and / N application identity stores with credential information and access authorizations. This allows the SI T employee to access facilities and systems. S. P 81. Access to some resources, both logical and physical, will require explicit approval before being 0 0 authorized. For these, the workflow notifies one or more access approvers for each such resource, and - 2 . then waits for responses. When the workflow receives approvals, it stores the authorized accesses in the identity store and provisions them to the silos. All information about approved, pending, and provisioned physical and logical access authorizations is maintained in the identity store. Pending access authorizations may be either authorizations that have been approved, but not yet provisioned, or time- bounded authorizations to be provisioned/de-provisioned at a future time. Explicit approval is used to ensure that OT managers and supervisors retain control over access to critical operational systems. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 24While the system to manage access authorizations is converged, the authority to make access authorizations remains distributed across IT, OT, and physical security management. When the HR system notifies the workflow that an employee is changing jobs, the workflow performs similar actions. First, it identifies resource accesses and credentials associated only with the employee’s former job. It revokes those resource accesses in the identity store and de-provisions them from the silos. It directs that associated credentials be invalidated and destroyed. It removes information about T h those credentials from the identity store and de-provisions credential information from the silos. si p Workflow actions are programmable and can be customized to meet organization-specific needs. It then u b identifies the resource accesses needed for the employee’s new job, authorizes them in the identity cil a store, and provisions them to the silos. The workflow identifies any new credentials that will be needed t oi n in the new job, triggers the creation and issuance of those credentials, waits for them to be created, a si updates the identity store, and provisions new credential information to the silos. v a ali When the HR system notifies the workflow that an employee has been terminated, the workflow b el removes all of the employee’s resource accesses from the identity store and de-provisions them from f r the run-time functions. It triggers the invalidation and destruction of the employee’s credentials, e e o removes credential information from the identity store, and de-provisions credential information from f c the silos. h a r g e In addition to input from the HR system to process personnel actions, the workflow can provide a portal f or for employees to request access to resources, which can be reviewed and approved. Also, systems other m h : than HR can be integrated with the workflow to initiate resource access requests. These capabilities tt reduce overhead and administrative downtime. p /: / od 5.1.1 Physical Access Control System Silo o.i r The PACS silo hosts both access controllers and badging systems. The badging systems implement a g 1/ credential issuance capability that creates the badges that employees use to gain access to facilities and 0 6. other physical resources. The access controllers read information from badges and check authorization 0 2 information to determine if a person should be allowed access. If access is allowed, the access controller 8 / N unlocks a door, allowing the person to enter the facility. SI T S. P 1. 8 0 0 - 2 .

P 1. The OT silo is composed of two types of systems: 8 0 0 ▪ operational management systems that operators and engineers use to monitor and manage the - 2 . generation and delivery of electric energy to customers ▪ industrial control systems (ICSs) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that provide real-time and near-real-time control of the equipment that produces and delivers electric energy NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 26Figure 5-4 shows the notional architecture of the OT silo. Figure 5-4 Notional OT Silo Architecture T h si p u b cil a t oi n si a v a ali b el f r e e o f c h a r g e f r o m h : tt p /: / The operations and management network within the OT silo has an identity store that contains d o o.i identities and access authorizations for operational management systems. These identities and r g authorizations are provisioned from the converged IdAM system. A cross-silo access-control capability / 1 0 allows some access to operational management systems from the IT silo. The converged IdAM system 6. 0 provisions authorizations to access OT resources from the IT silo into the OT identity store. 2 8 / N An electronic access control and monitoring system (EACMS) controls access to ICS/SCADA devices on SI T the ICS/SCADA network, from the operations management network. The EACMS allows operators and S. P engineers to have terminal access to the programmable logic controllers, relays, and remote terminal 1. 8 units (RTUs) that provide real-time control of energy production and delivery. Authorizations allowing 0 0 - access via the EACMS may be provisioned into the OT identity store or directly into the EACMS by the 2 . converged IdAM system. The converged IdAM system can provide time-bounded authorizations that will allow access during a limited time period. When the period expires, a workflow is triggered that revokes the authorization in the identity store and de-provisions the authorization from the OT identity store. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 27An ICS/SCADA firewall controls communication among ICS/SCADA devices. The converged IdAM system does not currently manage or provision authorizations that control device-to-device communications. Authorizations for device-to-device communications are either learned by the firewall in training mode or configured using a vendor-supplied application. This capability could be added in a future version of the converged IdAM system. 5.1.3 Information Technology Silo T h si The IT silo hosts business systems. These systems consist of user workstations and business applications p u running on Microsoft Windows or Linux servers. An IT identity store contains identities and access b cil authorizations for both business system users and system administrators who manage the applications a oit and servers. These authorizations are provisioned from the converged IdAM system. Applications that n si are not able to use an external identity store can be provisioned directly by the converged IdAM system. a v a Figure 5-5 shows the notional architecture of the IT silo. ali b el Figure 5-5 Notional IT Silo Architecture f r e e o f c h a r g e f r o m h : t t p /: / d o o.i r g / 1 0 6. 0 2 8 / N SI T S. P 1. 8 5.2 Example Solution Relationship to Use Case 0 0 - 2 . When we first defined this challenge in collaboration with industry members, we wrote the following scenario : “An energy company technician attempts to enter a substation. She is challenged to prove her identity in a way that provides a high degree of confidence and is not onerous (i.e., does not require a significant behavior change). Her attempt at entry initiates an authentication request that, if possible, connects to the company’s authentication and authorization services to validate NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 28her identity, ensure that she is authorized to access the substation, and confirm that a work order is on file for that substation and that worker at that time. Once she gains access to the substation, she focuses on the reason for her visit: She needs to diagnose a remote terminal unit (RTU) that has lost its network connectivity. She identifies the cause of the failure as a frayed Ethernet cable and replaces the cable with a spare. She then uses her company-issued mobile device, along with the same electronic credential she used for T h physical access, to log into the RTU’s web interface to test connectivity. The RTU queries the si p central authentication service to ensure the authenticity and authority of both the technician and u b cil her device, then logs the login attempt, the successful authentication, and the commands the ta technician sends during her session.” oi n si The first portion of the scenario deals with physical access to a substation. Unlike the description in this a v scenario, the example solution provides the management of identities and authorizations in a single a ali system but assumes that the decision to allow a particular technician to have access to a particular b el facility at a particular time may be distributed. Distributing the access decision-making capability helps f er ensure that access control continues to function in the event of communication failures. Utilities have e o indicated that communication failures with substations are common. Therefore, authorization to allow f hc the technician to have access to the substation will be created centrally by the IdAM workflow, placed in a gr the identity store, and then provisioned to the PACS responsible for the substation. Accomplishing this e f requires integrating the work order management system with the IdAM workflow. Assigning a work r o m order, to a technician, that requires access to a substation triggers actions within the IdAM workflow to h : authorize access to the substation and to provision that authorization to the substation PACS. When the t t p technician presents his/her physical access credential at the substation, the PACS uses the provisioned /: / d authorization to determine if he/she should be allowed to have access. Likewise, while not explicitly o o.i stated in the example, completion of the work order triggers the IdAM workflow to remove the r g technician’s substation access authorization and de-provision it from the substation PACS. / 1 0 6. The second portion of the scenario deals with logical access to ICS/SCADA devices within the substation. 0 2 8 Again, unlike the description in the scenario, the example solution centralizes the management of / N identities and authorizations, but assumes that run-time functions, such as authenticating a user and SI S.T granting the user to have access to specific ICS/SCADA devices, are distributed functions. In this case, P 1. the example solution assumes that the substation contains an EACMS to which the technician connects 8 0 his/her mobile device. The EACMS authenticates the technician and controls his/her access to 0 - 2 ICS/SCADA devices within the substation. Assigning the technician to this work order triggers an IdAM . workflow that authorizes him/her to have access to ICS/SCADA devices in the substation, stores these authorizations in the identity store, and provisions both the authorizations and any needed authentication credentials to the substation’s EACMS. Completion of the work order triggers the removal of the access authorization, and de-provisioning of authorizations and credentials, from the substation EACMS. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 295.3 Core Components of the Reference Architecture To verify the modularity of the example solution and to demonstrate alternative provisioning methods, we created two builds of the converged IdAM capability. Both builds used the following products: ▪ AlertEnterprise Guardian implements provisioning to an RS2 Technologies (RS2) Access It! PACS. ▪ TDi Technologies ConsoleWorks and a Schneider Electric Tofino firewall serve as an EACMS. T h si ▪ A Radiflow ICS/SCADA firewall controls interactions between two Modbus-speaking RTUs—a p Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL) RTU and an RTU emulated by a Raspberry Pi single- u b cil board computer. a t oi Build #1 used CA Technologies (CA) Identity Manager to implement the IdAM workflow and aspects of n si provisioning, and CA Directory to implement the identity store. Build #2 used the RSA IMG (now known va as RSA VIA Governance and RSA VIA Lifecycle) to implement the IdAM workflow and the RSA Adaptive a ali Directory to implement the identity store and aspects of provisioning. b el f r e e o f c h a r g e f r o m h : t t p /: / d o o.i r g / 1 0 6. 0 2 8 / N SI T S.

CA Identity Manager implements the IdAM workflow. It receives input from an HR system, in the form of 8 00 comma-separated value (CSV) files. We simulated the HR system by using manually produced CSV files - 2 . because the NCCoE lab does not have an HR system. A mutually authenticated, integrity-protected connection between an HR system and CA Identity Manager is the preferred solution. CA Identity Manager also provisions information to Microsoft AD instances in business systems (IT) and in the operational system (OT). No relationship among these AD instances is assumed. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 31IT applications are assumed to be integrated with the IT identity store implemented by Microsoft AD and use credential information and authorization information in this AD instance. If there are IT applications that are not integrated with AD, the provisioning capabilities of CA Identity Manager would be used to directly provision the applications. AlertEnterprise Guardian provisions physical access authorizations into the RS2 PACS. It is also capable of implementing workflow and provisioning ICS devices; however, those capabilities were not used in T h this build. CA Identity Minder supports call-outs within a workflow that can be used to invoke external si p programs. A call-out is used to connect with AlertEnterprise Guardian and to provide information to be u b provisioned to the RS2 PACS. cil a t oi An instance of TDi Technologies ConsoleWorks is installed in the OT silo and integrated with the OT n si identity store that is implemented by a Microsoft AD instance. Identity Manager provisions ICS/SCADA va access authorizations into this AD instance. ConsoleWorks uses the access authorizations in AD to a ali control user access to ICS/SCADA devices. ConsoleWorks also captures an audit trail of all user access to b el the ICS/SCADA network. f r e e A Schneider Electric Tofino firewall is installed between ConsoleWorks and the ICS/SCADA network. The o f firewall determines which Internet Protocol (IP) addresses within the ICS/SCADA network are accessible c h a through ConsoleWorks and which network protocols can be used when accessing those addresses, but r g e these are not managed by the converged IdAM solution. The combination of ConsoleWorks and the f or Tofino firewall implement an EACMS between the EMS / Operations Management Network and the m h : ICS/SCADA network. t t p /: / d o o.i r g / 1 0 6. 0 2 8 / N SI T S.

RSA IMG implements the IdAM workflow. It receives input from an HR system, in the form of CSV files. In Build #2, RSA IMG stores information in RSA Adaptive Directory, which subsequently provisions the information to the silo identity stores implemented with Microsoft AD instances. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 33RSA Adaptive Directory implements the identity store and provisioning portions of the example solution. RSA Adaptive Directory is a virtual directory that acts as a proxy in front of multiple back-end directories. The build assumes that each silo—OT, PACS, and IT—hosts a Microsoft AD instance. No relationship among these AD instances is assumed. When an IMG workflow stores information in Adaptive Directory, that information is actually stored in one or more of the underlying AD instances. In this way, storing information in Adaptive Directory provisions that information into one or more AD instances. T h AlertEnterprise Guardian provisions physical access authorizations into the RS2 PACS. RSA IMG writes si p these authorizations into Adaptive Directory, which stores them in the PACS AD instance. u b AlertEnterprise Guardian monitors the PACS AD instance for updates, such as changed physical access cil a authorizations for an existing user, the addition of a new user with physical access authorizations, or the t oi n removal of an existing user and associated access authorizations. When changes are detected, Guardian a si provisions them into the RS2 PACS. v a ali As in Build #1, TDi Technologies ConsoleWorks and a Schneider Electric Tofino firewall are used in the b el OT silo to provide an EACMS between the EMS / Operations Management Network and the ICS/SCADA f r network. ConsoleWorks utilizes the AD instance in OT for the authorization of users in this build as well. e e o f c 5.3.3 Implementation of the Use-Case Illustrative Scenario h a r This section explains how each of the two builds implements the scenario in Section 5.2. g e f or A work order management system assigns a technician to resolve an issue with an RTU at a substation. m h : The system initiates a workflow in either CA Identity Manager or RSA IMG that authorizes the technician tt to have physical access to the substation. In Build #1, this authorization is sent to AlertEnterprise p /: Guardian via a call-out in the workflow in CA Identity Manager. Guardian provisions the authorization / d o into the RS2 PACS. The authorization is also stored in the CA directory. In Build #2, this authorization is o.i r written to Adaptive Directory and stored in the PACS AD instance. AlertEnterprise Guardian detects the g 1/ authorization change for the technician and provisions it to RS2. When the technician arrives at the 0 6. substation and scans his/her credentials at the door, RS2 allows him/her to enter the facility. 0 2 8 / The workflow also authorizes access to ICS/SCADA devices in the substation. In Build #1, CA Identity N SI Manger stores this authorization in the CA directory and provisions it to the OT AD instance. In Build #2, T S. IMG writes this authorization to Adaptive Directory, which stores it in the OT AD instance. When the P 1. technician connects his/her mobile device to ConsoleWorks in the substation, he/she is authenticated, 8 0 0 and ConsoleWorks checks the OT AD instance, sees that he/she is authorized, and allows him/her to - 2 . access the ICS/SCADA devices in the substation. When the work order is closed, the work order management system triggers another workflow that removes the technician’s access authorizations. In Build #1, the authorizations are removed from the CA directory. Substation physical access is de-provisioned from RS2 via a call-out from the workflow to AlertEnterprise Guardian. Identity Manager de-provisions ICS/SCADA access from the OT AD. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 34ConsoleWorks detects the change in the OT AD instance and de-provisions the technician’s access to the RTU. In Build #2, IMG removes the authorizations from Adaptive Directory. This removes the authorizations from the PACS and OT AD instances. AlertEnterprise Guardian detects the change in the PACS AD instance and de-provisions the technician’s substation physical access. ConsoleWorks detects the change in the OT AD instance and de-provisions the technician’s access to the RTU. T h si Without an active assigned work order, the technician has no physical or logical access to the substation. p u b cil The reference architecture requires substations to have power and communications to receive a provisioned authorizations. The reference architecture does not address crisis or emergency situations t oi n where this requirement is not met. The reference architecture assumes that existing energy-company si a procedures for crisis or emergency response will be used/updated to address this challenge. v a bali 5.4 Supporting Components of the Reference Architecture el f er In addition to the products used to build an instance of the core example solution (the build), several e o products provide supporting components to the build, as shown in Figure 5-8. These products f c implement IdAM capabilities that, while necessary to completely implement IdAM within an h a r organization, are not an integral part of the converged IdAM capability. g e f or XTec AuthentX and GlobalSign demonstrate the outsourcing of some credential issuance and m h : management capabilities. XTec AuthentX also demonstrates the outsourcing of some physical tt access-control capabilities. p /: / d The XTec AuthentX Identity and Credential Management System (IDMS/CMS) provides a PIV-I smart- o o.i card credential, based on NIST standards, that can be used for logical and physical access, as well as the r /g description of the XTec product and its role in supporting the implementation of the example solution. 1 0 AuthentX demonstrates the outsourcing of some aspects of user registration, credential issuance and 6. 0 management, authentication, and access-control capabilities. These capabilities are provided using a 2 8 / cloud-hosted solution with identity vetting workflows, credential issuance stations, and full life-cycle N SI maintenance tools. AuthentX produces Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12–compliant smart T S. cards that are interoperable with, and trusted by, federal counterparts. P 1. 8 0 The components of the XTec solution in our lab included XNode, card readers, and compliant PIV-I cards. 0 - 2 The XTec product places the XNode, an IP-addressable RS232/RS485 controller within close range of the . reader and door strike, as opposed to a typical, central control-panel deployment. The XNode can also control SCADA devices and send them encrypted instructions. AuthentX IDMS/CMS can also provide a web-based implementation of the IdAM workflow in the example solution, as well as credential management and provisioning. AuthentX IDMS/CMS can control, log, and account for identity vetting, credential issuance, and credential usage with AuthentX PACS and NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 35logical access controls, as well as immediately control credential revocation to all interoperable resources. GlobalSign operates an NAESB-accredited software-as-a-service Certificate Authority. It illustrates an outsourced credential issuance and management capability that provides NAESB-compliant X.509 digital certificates. NAESB-compliant digital certificates are required credentials for authenticating Open Access Same-Time Information Systems (OASIS) transactions and access to the Electronic Industry Registry—the T h central repository for information related to energy scheduling and management activities in North si p America . u b cil Mount Airey Group’s (MAG’s) Ozone and Cisco’s Identity Services Engine (ISE) demonstrate a t oi access-control decision and enforcement capabilities that the converged IdAM capability can provision. n si MAG Ozone can also provide authorization management capabilities. a v a The MAG Ozone product provides a high-assurance attribute-based access control (ABAC) ali b implementation . ABAC controls access to resources by evaluating access rules using attributes el f associated with the resource being accessed, the person accessing the resource, and the environment. r e e Ozone Authority provides a high-assurance attribute store. Attributes stored in Ozone Authority are o f managed using Ozone Console. Ozone manages attributes that control access to high-value transactions, c h a such as high-dollar-value financial transactions. r g e f Ozone Authority pulls attributes either from Adaptive Directory in Build #2 or from an AD instance in r o m Build #1.

MAG provided an application for the IT silo to demonstrate some of Ozone’s capabilities. Other than the 8 0 MAG demonstration application, a full ABAC capability was not included in the architecture. A separate 0 - 2 NCCoE project is creating an ABAC building block that could be used in IT or OT. The application is . described in Appendix A . Cisco ISE controls the ability of devices to connect over the network. ISE expands on basic network address-based control to include the identity of the person using a device. ISE is used in the builds to provide a gateway function between OT and IT, limiting which users and devices are allowed to connect from IT to resources in OT. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 375.5 Build #3 – An Alternative Core Component Build of the Example Solution RSA, CA, and AlertEnterprise all provide products that can implement the IdAM workflow, identity store, and provisioning. Our initial builds of the example solution used RSA and CA products to implement the IdAM workflow, the identity store, and AD provisioning. AlertEnterprise Guardian was used to provision the RS2 PACS; however, Guardian can also implement the IdAM workflow, identity store, and both OT T h si and IT provisioning. To illustrate Guardian’s full capabilities, AlertEnterprise created this independent p u build of the example solution in their labs, using the Guardian product (Figure 5-9).

NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 38AlertEnterprise Guardian implements the IdAM workflow. It receives input from an HR system in the form of CSV files. We simulated the HR system by using manually produced CSV files because the NCCoE lab does not have an HR system. The preferred solution is a mutually authenticated, integrity-protected connection between an HR system and AlertEnterprise Guardian. Guardian provisions information to Microsoft AD instances in OT and IT. No relationship among these AD instances is assumed. IT applications are assumed to be integrated with AD, and use credential information and authorization T h information in the IT AD instance. If there are IT applications that are not integrated with AD, the si p provisioning capabilities of Guardian would be used to directly provision the applications. u b cil Guardian provisions physical access authorizations into the RS2 PACS. Physical Access and Cardholder a t oi life-cycle functions are supported through Guardian workflow to ensure that the right level of access is n si granted to the right people, based on training, compliance, and security requirements. a v a An instance of TDi Technologies ConsoleWorks and a Schneider Electric Tofino firewall are installed in ali b the OT silo to implement an EACMS between the EMS / Operations Management network and the el f ICS/SCADA network. ConsoleWorks is integrated with the OT AD instance. Guardian provisions r e e ICS/SCADA access authorizations in the OT AD instance. ConsoleWorks uses the access authorizations in o f OT AD to control user access to ICS/SCADA devices. c h a gr Additional information about Build #3 is available from the AlertEnterprise website . e f r o m 5.6 Build Implementation Description h : tt The infrastructure was built on Dell model PowerEdge R620 server hardware.

The networks are a management network and a production network (Figure 5-10). / N SI The management network was implemented to facilitate the implementation, configuration, and T S. management of the underlying infrastructure, including the physical servers, vSphere infrastructure, P 1. and monitoring. The production network (Figure 5-11) consists of the following components: 8 0 0 - ▪ the demilitarized zone (DMZ) 2 . ▪ IdAM ▪ IT network – business management systems ▪ OT network – ICS/SCADA industrial control system and EMS ▪ PACS network NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 41These networks were implemented separately to match a typical electricity subsector enterprise infrastructure. The network diagrams and descriptions presented here illustrate and explain the laboratory environment that was used at NCCoE to build proof-of-concept implementations of the example solution. This lab architecture is not intended as security guidance. Firewalls block all traffic, except required internetwork communications. The primary internetwork communications are the user-access and authorization updates from the central IdAM systems between the directories and the OT, PACS, and IT networks.

The IT network represents the business management network that typically supports corporate email, P 1. file sharing, printing, and internet access for general business-purpose computing and communications. 8 0 0 - 2 The OT network represents the network that is used to support the EMSs and ICS/SCADA systems. . Traffic is allowed into and out of the OT network via the OT firewall, for specific ports and protocols between specific systems identified by IP address. The PACS network represents the network that supports the PACS across the enterprise. Typically, this network uses the enterprise IT network, and is segmented from the user networks by virtual local area networks (VLANs), which provide traffic and management segregation in the NCCoE Energy Sector lab. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 43VLANs, alone, should not be considered a security separation mechanism. In our architecture, a firewall allows limited access to and from the PACS network to facilitate the communication of access and authorization information. Technically, this communication consists of user role and responsibility directory updates originating in the IdAM system. 5.6.2 Build Network Components T h 5.6.2.1 Internet si p u The public internet is accessible by the lab environment to facilitate both cloud services and access for b cil vendors and NCCoE administrators. a t oi si n 5.6.2.2 VPN Firewall a v The VPN firewall is the access-control point for vendors, to support the installation and configuration of a ali their components of the architecture. We used this access to facilitate product training and b el implementation support. This firewall also blocks unauthorized traffic from the public internet to the f r e production networks. We used additional firewalls to secure the multiple domain networks (OT, PACS, e o IT, and IdAM). f c h a r 5.6.2.3 Switching and Routing g e f or Switching in the architecture is executed using a series of physical and hypervisor soft switches. VLANs m are implemented to segment the networks shown in Figure 5-10 and Figure 5-11. VLAN switching h : t functions are handled by physical Dell switches and the virtual environment.

The interface can be used to configure the RTU and to issue real-time function commands (e.g., open/close relays). The access-control/gateway function uses the OT directory to obtain access authority for each user requesting access to an RTU.

XTec XNode is a PACS using smart-card readers, pin pads, and an internet cloud-based authorization service. The cloud service can federate (interoperate) with corporate identity and access stores or can be operated as a fully outsourced PACS IdAM solution. XNode was used as a standalone access-control capability. It was not integrated or federated with the converged IdAM system, and its ability to contribute to compliance with NERC CIP Version 5 security requirements was not addressed. The RS2 system includes card readers, pin pads, and the Access It! local management server. The local management server is T h si integrated with the central identity and access store via the AlertEnterprise Guardian product. In p u Build #1, Guardian receives IdAM data directly from Identity Manager. Once the information is received, b cil Guardian provisions the information to the PACS management server. In Build #2, Guardian monitors a oit the PACS directory for IdAM changes. Once changes are identified, Guardian collects the information n si and provisions the IdAM information to the PACS management server. a v a ali 5.6.6 Identity and Access Management Network b el f 5.6.6.1 Build #1 r e e o Build #1 includes the following IdAM network components: f c h a ▪ central IdAM system r g e f ▪ PACS IdAM interface system r o m ▪ SQL server h : tt ▪ MAG Ozone components p /: / d The IdAM was separated to highlight the unique IdAM components that were proposed to address the o o.i use-case requirements.

The security of the solution partially 8 0 0 depends on limited access to the managed directories, as discussed in Section 5.9.6. - 2 . In this build, the OT, PACS, and IT directories synchronize (sync) with the central IdAM system by using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Secure (LDAPS). This synchronization is set up to immediately sync changes from the IdAM system to each directory. In addition, an automated sync function can be implemented to check for unauthorized changes in each directory to increase the security of the implementation. Automated sync was not implemented in this build.

RSA IdAM products and AlertEnterprise provide central identity and access stores, as well as a workflow management capability. The central IdAM system takes over the control of the directory instances in each silo. The control is implemented by providing an administrative account credential for each managed directory to the IdAM system. This is an important aspect of the implementation.

The workflows p /: include management approval chains as well as approval/denial data logging. Once the central IdAM / d o system has processed the access and authority request, the updated user access and authorization data o.i r is pushed to the central identity store. The central identity store contains the distribution mechanism g 1/ for updating the various downstream (synchronized) directories with user access and authorization 0 6. data. This process applies to new users, terminated users (disabled or deleted users), and any changes 0 2 to a user profile. Changes include promotions, job responsibility changes, and anything else that would 8 / N affect the systems that a user needs to access.

Note that all data routed between networks flows through the DMZ and network firewalls. In the OT network, ConsoleWorks controls access to the OT ICS/SCADA devices. ConsoleWorks uses the OT directory to determine which users are authorized to access OT ICS/SCADA devices; it is the control point for users accessing OT network devices. ConsoleWorks stores profiles for groups and specific T h si users. The profiles define the OT devices that each user is authorized to access. In addition, p u ConsoleWorks monitors and logs each user session. This feature allows an organization to monitor user b cil activity, block undesired activities, and generate alerts for suspicious or undesired activities. a t oi n In the IT network, a Cisco TrustSec switch controls which users have access to the OT network. ISE si a controls the TrustSec switch. This provides an Electronic Access Point to the ICS/SCADA network, as v a described in NERC CIP-005. ISE uses the IT directory identity store to determine user access authority bali and to limit access to the ICS/SCADA network to authorized users. This capability enhances the el f enterprise’s ability to follow NERC CIP-005.

In both builds, the IdAM system was initially populated with user data from a synthetic data set. The data set was designed to mirror a typical HR-system data-set export file. Because the NCCoE lab does not have an HR system, it NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 56used a CSV file, which is a typical HR-system export-file type, to simulate an HR system. The preferred solution is a mutually authenticated, integrity-protected connection between an HR system and the IdAM system. The data included user names, titles, access assignments, unique identifiers, and other details required to complete valid directory entries. Once the set of user data was loaded into the IdAM system, each silo directory was provisioned with the appropriate user data. Each silo directory was pre- configured with the group and attribute fields that are needed to support the builds. For example, the T OT network directory had user groups corresponding to the ConsoleWorks user groups. The details are h p si included in the How-To guide (NIST SP 1800-2C). u b cil 5.8 Security Characteristics Related to NERC CIP Version 5 a t oi n The example solution impacts, and is impacted by, the requirement to conform to NERC CIP Version 5 si a standards. The NERC CIP cybersecurity standards provide specific requirements that apply to the bulk v a power system and were used as a reference by the development team. The proposed solution is ali b designed to be CIP-informed.

Its purpose is to verify that the example solution meets its security claims, and to understand the trade-offs involved in doing so. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 59▪ This is not a red team exercise. The intent was to verify the security claims, not to break hardware or software involved in the example solution. ▪ The lab routers and firewalls were not included in the evaluation. It is assumed that they are hardened. Testing these devices would reveal only weaknesses in implementation that would not be of value to those adopting this example solution. T 5.9.3 Example Solution Analysis h p si Table 5-3 lists the example-solution components, their functions, and the security characteristics that u b they provide. This analysis focuses on these security capabilities, rather than on the vendor-specific acil components. In theory, any number of commercially available components can provide these security t oi capabilities. Some of these components are in Build #1 of the IdAM example solution, and other n si components are in Build #2. We discuss these components as generic components that provide a a v specific security functionality, rather than as vendor products. One vendor product could be substituted a ali for another vendor product that provides the same security functionality, without affecting the results b el of the evaluation. f r e o e Table 5-3 IdAM Components and Security Capability Mapping f c h a Component Specific Product Function Security Characteristic r g e rf Identity, RSA IMG IdAM workflow engine; Authentication and o m authorization, and or manages identities, authorization h : workflow manager credentials, and t CA Identity Manager t p authorization for all other /: / network components in the d o o.i use case; enforces r workflows to ensure that g / 1 access-control policies are 0 6. enforced 0 2 8 Identity store RSA Adaptive Database of user identities Authentication and / N SI Directory (identity authorization T S. store), which is used P 1. with RSA IMG, 8 0 or 0 - 2 Windows SQL 2012, . which is used with CA Identity Manager NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 60Component Specific Product Function Security Characteristic High-assurance MAG Ozone system Access control solution with attribute service ABAC architecture; provides increased assurance by signing attributes with private key infrastructure T h (PKI) and requiring users to si p authenticate with PKI u b cil Translator between AlertEnterprise Translates from RSA/CA Authorization and a t the AD and the Guardian IdAM stores on the IdAM access control oi n PACS and OT access network to OT and PACS si a management access management v a systems systems, enabling access ali management devices in the b el OT and PACS networks to be f r e provisioned from the IdAM e o network f c h Directory service Microsoft AD (for IT Database of PACS or IT Authentication and a r g devices) resource and user authorization e rf or identifiers, and their o m associated security policies RS2 PACS server (for h : t PACS devices) t p /: SCADA router and Radiflow IP-addressable industrial Access control / d o the remote control system gateway that o.i manager of the enables remote control of r g / SCADA router physical devices: 1 0 6. management workstation 0 2 enables remote 8 / management of physical N SI SCADA router; SCADA router T S. serves as firewall, terminal P 1. server, and IP-to-serial 8 0 connectivity 0 - 2 .

These security characteristics are listed in a security control map published in the appendix of the IdAM use-case description . Six security characteristics are listed in the security control map, each of which is further classified by the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) categories and subcategories to which they map. The CSF subcategories hT further map to specific sections of each standard or best practice that are cited in the CSF in reference si p to that subcategory. Figure 5-21 depicts an example of the process for determining the security u b standards-based attributes for the example solution. cil a oit Figure 5-21 Example Process for Determining the Security Standards-Based Attributes for the n si Example Solution a v a ali b el f r e e o f c h a r g e f r o m h : t t p /: / d o o.i r g / 1 0 6. 0 2 8 / N SI We used the CSF subcategories to provide structure to the security assessment by consulting the specific T S. sections of each standard or best practice that are cited in reference to that subcategory. The cited P 1. sections provide example-solution validation points by listing specific traits that a solution that supports 8 0 0 the desired security characteristics should exhibit. Using the CSF subcategories as a basis for organizing - 2 . our analysis, and consulting the specific sections of the security standards that are cited with respect to each subcategory, allowed us to systematically consider how well the example solution supports the security characteristics identified in the use-case description. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 62The remainder of this subsection discusses how the example solution addresses the six desired security characteristics that are listed in the use-case description appendix : ▪ authentication for OT ▪ access control for OT ▪ authorization (provisioning) for OT T sih ▪ centrally monitor the use of accounts p u ▪ protect the exchange of identity and access information b cil a ▪ provision, modify, or revoke access throughout all federated entities t oi n The remainder of this subsection also discusses how the authentication, access control, and si a authorization (provisioning) security characteristics are addressed for PACS, not just for OT. v a bali 5.9.4.1 Authentication, Access Control, and Authorization for OT el f r The implementation includes the capabilities that support these security characteristics. Section 5.6.7.1 e e o describes the information flows for supporting authentication, access control, and authorization f c (provisioning) on the OT network. h a r g e 5.9.4.2 Centrally Monitor Use of Accounts f r o m The example solution supports converged accountability and tracking of user accounts, with the IdAM h : identity, authorization, and workflow manager acting as the locus of this capability. t t p //: On the OT network, the console access manager, which acts as the gatekeeper to all ICS/SCADA devices, d o monitors and logs all ICS/SCADA access requests and responses, as well as all user interactions with the o.i r ICS/SCADA OT devices. These logs should be centrally monitored along with other ICS/SCADA OT g / 1 monitoring within the enterprise. 0 6. 0 2 The network access-control component also logs all access requests and responses received at, and 8 N/ generated by, the IT network switch that controls access to the OT network from the IT network. These SI logs should be centrally monitored along with other ICS/SCADA OT monitoring within the enterprise. T S. P 1. On the PACS network, the PACS devices also report/log user access requests and responses to the PACS 8 0 server. These logs should be centrally monitored along with other ICS/SCADA OT monitoring within the 0 - 2 enterprise. In addition, the IdAM identity, authorization, and workflow manager and the translator . component log the PACS access change (add, delete, or change) requests. While these technical security controls provide capabilities to capture the information needed for accountability, they are only effective when combined with necessary procedural and managerial security controls. Implementation of these controls is outside the scope of this guide. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 635.9.4.3 Protect Exchange of Identity and Access Information All IdAM-related information exchanges between IdAM components (as shown by the red lines in Figure 5-17 through Figure 5-20) should be performed in protected mode. In other words, at the least, integrity checking mechanisms are performed on this communication so that tampering can be detected. Preferably, these communications are encrypted. In particular, the following information exchanges should be performed in protected mode: T h p si ▪ all information exchanges to/from the directory services in the IT, OT, and PACS networks u cilb ▪ all information exchanges between the console access manager (e.g., the ConsoleWorks a component shown in Figure 5-17) and the OT directory service t oi si n ▪ all information exchanges between the PACS server and the PACS translator component a (e.g., the AlertEnterprise component shown in Figure 5-18 and Figure 5-19) v a ali Because of time constraints, the laboratory builds of the example solution did not include encryption or b el integrity assurance for every IdAM information exchange. Nevertheless, such protection is strongly f er recommended when deploying the example solution. e o f c 5.9.4.4 Provision, Modify, or Revoke Access h a r g User authorizations for the use of all IT, OT, and PACS network account assets, for ICS/SCADA devices e rf and for physical access to rooms, facilities, etc., are provisioned, modified, and revoked by modifying o m user authorization information in the central IdAM identity, authorization, and workflow manager (CA h : t Identity Manager or RSA IMG). These components, in turn, propagate the changes to all entities that are t p /: used to make local authorization and access determinations. Such information propagation ensures that / d all attempts to access IT, OT, and PACS network assets, SCADA devices, and rooms and facilities are o o.i uniformly handled because they are subject to the same updated access and authorization information r g / when the silo directory, console manager, PACS server, or other IdAM device is consulted in response to 1 0 6. the access attempt. 0 2 8 / 5.9.5 Assessment of Reference Architecture N TSI The IdAM example solution is not intended to encompass all aspects of electricity subsector S. P organization operations. It was designed to centralize the management of authorization and access in 1. 8 three disparate IdAM silos. Thus, our assessment considers the solution itself, not the broader problem 0 0 of providing general security to all aspects of electricity subsector organization operations. - 2 . The example solution includes three network silos (OT, PACS, and IT), plus an IdAM network with numerous components that provide centralization, uniformity, and efficiency through the use of IdAM workflows. All threats and vulnerabilities that are present on the IT, OT, and PACS networks are also present in the example solution, so they will need to be addressed during solution deployment. This evaluation assumes that the OT, PACS, and IT networks are already protected by using physical-access- NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 64control and network-security components, such as firewalls and intrusion detection devices that are configured according to best practices. 5.9.5.1 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Assumptions This evaluation concerns the IdAM network itself, its components, and their interaction with IdAM components on the IT, OT, and PACS networks, which provide the benefits afforded by the example T h solution and introduce new attack surfaces and potential threats. For example, each of the IT, OT, and si p PACS networks has directory service components that must be secured. If the information in these u b directories is not safeguarded against tampering, the organization is at risk. These directories must be cil a safeguarded in both the existing three-silo architecture and the example solution. The example solution, t oi however, includes additional, related directory components that must also be protected, as described in n si Section 5.6. a v a ali The identity, authorization, and workflow manager and the identity store on the IdAM network must be b el protected from unauthorized access, and their information must be safeguarded. All of the data in the r f directory service components in the OT, PACS, and IT networks is accessible by the identity, e e o authorization, and workflow manager and the identity store. The ability to propagate data from the f c IdAM network to the OT, PACS, and IT networks is the main strength, and the greatest vulnerability, of h a r the example solution. If the IdAM identity store, or the identity, authorization, and workflow manager g e f that has access to it, were compromised, this would equate to a compromise of each of the directory r o m services in the IT, OT, and PACS networks. As a result, controlling access to the IdAM network and to h : each IdAM component, and securing communications among IdAM components, is essential to securing t pt the example solution. Therefore, the analysis of the security of the IdAM network, its components, and /: / the communications among IdAM components is central to the evaluation of the IdAM example d o o.i solution. r g 1/ 5.9.5.1.1 Controlling Access to the Identity, Authorization, and Workflow Manager 0 6. The identity, authorization, and workflow manager on the IdAM network contains information regarding 0 2 actual users and accounts for the OT, PACS, and IT networks. It manages the identities and credentials 8 / N for the rest of the use case, but it does not manage them for itself. In other words, the identity, SI T authorization, and workflow manager component itself does not control user access to the identity, S. P authorization, and workflow manager. It has a separate set of user accounts and passwords that are 1. 8 specific to this component and that IdAM administrators use to log into it. This access must be strictly 0 0 - controlled so that only authorized IdAM administrators can log into the identity, authorization, and 2 . workflow manager. Users or authorized systems (such as an HR system or a work order management system) must log into the identity, authorization, and workflow manager to provision all electricity subsector systems (i.e., add identity information and authorization rules for new users, delete information for former users, and modify information as user authorizations change). The risks associated with access to the IdAM workflow are described in Section 4.3.2. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 65There is no AD running on the IdAM network. In the builds, access to the identity, authorization, and workflow manager and to all other components of the IdAM network is granted by the use of a username and credential, presented via either a web interface or each machine’s OS console. An organization deploying the example solution operationally would, of course, be free to implement alternative access-control mechanisms. While both privileged and unprivileged users may access the identity, authorization, and workflow manager and other IdAM components, only highly privileged users T should be permitted to create, delete, or modify accounts. Monitoring, logging, and auditing all activity h p si that is performed directly on IdAM components, such as the identity, authorization, and workflow u b manager or the identity store, is essential to ensure that authorized users are not performing cil unauthorized activities. a t oi n si 5.9.5.1.2 Logging Activity on IdAM Components a Logging all activity that is performed on IdAM components is crucial for securing the example solution. v alia Ideally, access to all components on the IdAM network should be logged for the purpose of auditing and b accountability. The example solution is designed to allow the logging of all user activity on IdAM systems el f (e.g., identity, access, and authorization changes). The example solution should also log all activity that is r e e performed by administrators so that no activity is exempt from monitoring, logging, and auditing. This o c f section provides a closer look at the following three different types of IdAM system users (in terms of h a the amount of privilege that they have) and whether or not their activity should be logged: r g e rf ▪ unprivileged users o m h : ▪ administrators t pt ▪ super-administrators /: / d Unprivileged users, by definition, are not authorized to interact with any IdAM system. They cannot o o.i create an account on the identity, authorization, and workflow manager, or modify the privileges of a r g / user who already has an account. A user who works for HR, for example, who needs to add a user 1 0 6. identity or modify a user’s authorizations, would have an account on the identity, authorization, and 0 2 workflow manager (that was set up by a privileged user) that allows him/her to add to or modify the 8 N/ information in the identity, authorization, and workflow manager component via a web interface. Such a TSI user would never be able to access the identity, authorization, and workflow manager via its machine’s S. P OS console. Console access would enable the user to manage the OS on which the component is 1. 8 running. All that the unprivileged user needs is the ability to use his/her own, unprivileged, user-level 0 0 account on the identity, authorization, and workflow manager’s machine. Because the example solution - 2 . is designed to monitor and log all activity that occurs over a web interface, it will log all unprivileged user activity. Administrators, by definition, can access OS consoles and create user accounts on IdAM machines, such as the identity, authorization, and workflow manager. However, they are not authorized to change the access-control policies within the console access manager. As a result, when administrators access the NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 66consoles of an IdAM system OS, they must do so via the console access manager. The console access manager will log and monitor all administrator activity at any OS console. Super-administrators, by definition, can not only access machine consoles and create user accounts on IdAM machine OSs, but they can change the access-control policies within the console access manager. Therefore, the example solution cannot force them to use the console access manager when accessing the consoles of IdAM system machine OSs. If super-administrators do access the consoles of IdAM T h si system machine OSs, and do so not via the console manager, then their activity will not be logged or p monitored. So, while super-administrators should be strongly encouraged by policy to use the console u b cil access manager, IdAM does not provide a technical mechanism to ensure that they will use the console a t access manager. oi n si Access to the identity store on the IdAM network also must be strictly controlled, and the identity store a v should be configured so that it will only perform addition, modification, and deletion requests that are a ali received from the identity, authorization, and workflow manager. If the identity store were to accept b el updates or edits from another entity, the result could be catastrophic. Any updates made by an f r e administrator would have to be made via the machine console, so, at least, these updates would be e o logged. Updates made by a super-administrator could escape detection if the super-administrator were f c h to defy organization policy and access the identity store console without going through the console a r g access manager. We acknowledge insider threats, but feel that mitigating the risk of insider threats e rf presently relies more on organizational policy decisions than on technology. Therefore, addressing o m insider threat is outside the scope of this project. h : t pt 5.9.5.1.3 Unauthorized Modification of Access and Authorization Information /: / User identity and credential information is added into the identity, authorization, and workflow d o o.i manager, and then propagated to other IdAM components. If this information were deleted, modified, gr or falsified while in transit between components or while stored in a component, the result could be / 01 catastrophic. It is essential to protect access to each IdAM component so that adversaries cannot modify 6. 0 IdAM information stored in the components, and so that IdAM information has, at least, its integrity 2 8 and, ideally, its confidentiality protected when in transit between IdAM components. / N SI T 5.9.5.2 Mitigations: Essentials for Securing the IdAM Example Solution S. P 1. Based on the information flows for supporting OT authentication, OT access control, and OT 8 0 0 authorization described in Section 5.6.7, securing the part of the IdAM example solution that supports - 2 . OT access control requires the following actions: ▪ securing access to the following components: • identity, authorization, and workflow manager; identity store; and network access-control components on the IdAM network (i.e., ensuring that only authorized users can access and add, modify, or delete information on these components) NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 67• directory service and console access manager components on the OT network (i.e., ensuring that only authorized users can access and add, modify, or delete information on these components) • IT network access-control switch that serves as a gateway to the OT network from the IT network ▪ protecting the integrity of the information exchanges between the following components: T h si • identity manager and the identity stores p u b • identity store and the directory service on the OT network cil a oit • directory service and the console access manager components on the OT network, as well n as the network access-control and policy-enforcement system within the IT network si a v • network access-control and component identity stores a ali b • network access-control component on the IT network and the IT network access-control el f switch that serves as a gateway to the OT network r e e o Based on the information flows for supporting PACS authentication, PACS access control, and PACS f c authorization described in Section 5.6.7, securing the part of the IdAM example solution that supports h a PACS access control requires the following actions: r g e rf ▪ securing access to the following components: o m h : • identity, authorization, and workflow manager; identity store; and IdAM translator tt components on the IdAM network (i.e., ensuring that only authorized users can access and p /: add, modify, or delete information on these components) / d o o.i • IdAM identity store and PACS directory service components on the PACS network gr (i.e., ensuring that only authorized users can access and add, modify, or delete information / 1 on these components) 0 6. 0 ▪ protecting the integrity of the information exchanges between the components: 2 8 / N • identity manager and identity stores SI T S. • identity store on the IdAM network and the PACS directory service on the PACS network P 1. 8 • IdAM translator component on the IdAM network and the IdAM directory service on the 0 0 PACS network - 2 . • IdAM translator component on the IdAM network and the PACS management server on the PACS network NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 685.9.5.3 Trade-offs As mentioned earlier, the very characteristics that are the main objectives of the example solution, namely centralization and uniformity of the management of authorization and access, are also its main vulnerabilities. A successful attack on the IdAM network or its components could result in a compromise of one or all of the OT, PACS, and IT networks. Organizations that implement the example solution may incur additional costs to secure the IdAM network and its components. T h si p 5.9.5.3.1 Benefits u b The benefits of the IdAM example solution include consolidated management of identity and access acil audit data; documented and repeatable business and security access decision processes (workflows); t oi approval/denial data logging; rapid provisioning and de-provisioning using consistent, efficient, and n si automated processes; and better situational awareness through the ability to track and audit all access a v requests and other IdAM activity across all four networks (IT, OT, PACS, and IdAM). Other important a ali benefits include greatly reduced time to implement access-control changes, and highly automated b el identity synchronization across silos. For example, an OT, PACS, and/or IT access change request can be f r e implemented within minutes. These benefits directly reduce the cost of the regulatory audit e o requirements imposed on the energy industry. They also enable IdAM processes to be handled f c h efficiently, and with more granular, prompt, and cost-effective control. a r g e f 5.9.6 Security Recommendations r o m While the example solution provides a converged IdAM security solution, the solution itself provides a h : single attack vector that, if compromised, could have devastating consequences. Therefore, an t t p /: organization that implements the example solution must take great care to secure the IdAM example / d solution itself. When deploying their own implementations, organizations should adhere to the o o.i following security recommendations: r g / 1 ▪ Conduct their own evaluations of their example-solution implementation. 0 6. 0 ▪ Deploy all components on securely configured OSs that use multifactor authentication and are 2 8 / configured according to best practices, based on Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) N SI Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)  and example secure configuration T S. guidelines found in the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Security Benchmarks . P 1. 8 ▪ Ensure that all OSs on which example-solution implementation components are running are 0 0 hardened, maintained, and kept up-to-date in terms of patching, version control, and virus and - 2 . malware detection. ▪ Put into place a security infrastructure that will protect the example solution itself, and will secure the communications among the components on the IdAM network and between these components and the IdAM components on the other three networks, as described in Section 5.9.5.2. Many of the remaining recommendations relate to providing such a security infrastructure. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 69▪ Design the authorization and workflow policies that are enforced by the identity, authorization, and workflow manager component, to enforce the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. ▪ Design the authorization and access-control policies that govern user access to the IdAM components themselves, to enforce the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. ▪ Segregate IdAM components onto their own network, either physically or by using private T h VLANs and port-based authentication, or similar mechanisms (e.g., in IEEE 802.1X, a standard for si p port-based network access control  that provides an authentication mechanism to devices u b that are to be attached to a local area network). cil a t ▪ Deploy a security infrastructure to secure the IdAM network and the IdAM platforms oi n themselves. This infrastructure must consist of a holistic set of components that work together si a to prevent the IdAM network, components, and workflow from being used as an attack vector. v a ali ▪ Protect the IdAM network by using security components, such as firewalls and intrusion b el detection devices that are configured according to best practices (e.g., in NIST SP 800-41 r f Revision 1, Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy ). e e o ▪ Protect each of the OT, PACS, and IT networks by using security components, such as firewalls f c and intrusion detection devices that are configured according to best practices. h a r g ▪ Strictly control physical access to the OT, PACS, IT, and IdAM networks. e f r o ▪ Configure firewalls to limit connections between the IdAM network and the production (IT, OT, m h : and PACS) networks, except for the connections needed to support required internetwork tt communications to specific IP address and port combinations in certain directions. p /: / ▪ Perform, in protected mode, all IdAM-related information exchanges between IdAM d o o.i components (as shown by the red lines in Figure 5-17 through Figure 5-20)—meaning that, at r the least, integrity-checking mechanisms are performed on this communication so that g / 1 tampering can be detected. Preferably, these communications should be encrypted. In 0 6. particular, the following information exchanges should be performed in protected mode: 0 2 8 / • all information exchanges to/from the directory services in each of the OT, PACS, and IT N SI networks T S. P • all information exchanges between the console access manager (i.e., the ConsoleWorks 1. 8 component in Figure 5-17) and the OT directory service 0 0 - 2 • all information exchanges between the network access-control manager (i.e., the Cisco ISE . component in Figure 5-17) and the switch in the IT network that controls access to the OT network • all information exchanges between the PACS server and the PACS translator component (e.g., the AlertEnterprise component in Figure 5-18 and Figure 5-19) NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 70In the case of IdAM exchanges with the silo directories, protected mode is defined as the use of Start Transport Layer Security (TLS) , rather than LDAPS, which uses Secure Socket Layer and has been deprecated in favor of Start TLS. ▪ Install, configure, and use each component of the example solution (e.g., the identity, authorization, and workflow manager or the PAC server) according to the security guidance provided by the component vendor. T h si ▪ Configure all IdAM components on the IdAM network so that it is impossible to remotely access p u them. b cil ▪ Log all IdAM activity (e.g., direct access to IdAM components on the IdAM network, all messages a t oi exchanged between IdAM components). Limit the number of users who are able to control n si whether or not a performed activity is logged. a av ▪ Require super-administrators (i.e., users who are authorized to change the access-control ali policies within the console access manager) to use a console access manager when accessing b el the console of all devices on the IdAM network, and never to directly access any console. Use of f er a console access manger ensures that all activity that is performed via the console is logged. e o f ▪ Configure the console access manager to have an always-on connection to all devices on the c h IdAM network so that it can monitor each device’s console port. This configuration ensures that a r g all activity that is performed over the console port will be logged. Configure the console access e rf manager to generate an alert if the always-on connection to any device is disconnected. This o m configuration ensures that security auditors can be aware of any times during which the console h : port of a device may have been accessed without the activity being logged or monitored. t t p /: ▪ Configure all devices on the IdAM network so that they have only one console port (the port to / od which the console access manager has an always-on connection). Alternatively, where o.i applicable, configure the devices on the IdAM network to allow only one console connection or r g / login at a time. This will ensure that the console access manager will log all activity that is 1 0 performed via the console of any of these devices. 6. 0 2 /8 5.9.7 Security Characteristics Evaluation Summary N SI Overall, the example solution and the workflow processes that it enforces succeed in centralizing IdAM T S. functions across the OT, PACS, and IT networks, to provide an efficient, uniform, and secure solution for P 1. authenticating and authorizing access across all systems and facilities. The solution enables 8 0 0 access-control policies across all three networks to be enforced consistently, quickly, and with a high - 2 . degree of granularity, so that users are granted only enough privilege necessary to complete their work, and for only the necessary amount of time. It also enables a converged, simplified audit capability for accountability and tracking. This requires all access to the IdAM network, its components, and the information exchanged between these components and the OT, PACS, and IT networks, to be secured and monitored. NIST SP 1800-2B: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 71Organizations adopting this example solution must also have policies, procedures, and processes in place that effectively use the solutions capabilities to maximize benefits. Further, the organizations must consider and address the security risks associated with their deployment. Section 5.9.6 describes basic security considerations for the example solution. 6 Functional Evaluation T h si We conducted a functional evaluation of the IdAM example solution to verify that several common key p u provisioning functions of the example solution, as implemented in our laboratory build, worked as b cil expected. The IdAM workflow capability demonstrated the ability to perform the following actions a oit centrally: n a si ▪ assign and provision access privileges to users, based on a set of programmed business rules in v a the OT, PACS, and IT networks and systems ali b ▪ create, activate, and deactivate users in the OT, PACS, and IT networks and systems el f er ▪ change an existing user’s access to the various networks and systems e o f Section 6.1 explains the functional test plan in more detail, and lists the procedures used for each of the c h functional tests. a r g e rf 6.1 IdAM Functional Test Plan o m h : This test plan includes the test cases necessary to conduct the functional evaluation of the IdAM use t t p case. The IdAM implementation is currently deployed in a lab at the NCCoE.

NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), a part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is a collaborative hub where industry organizations, government agencies, and academic institutions work together to address businesses’ most pressing cybersecurity issues. This public-private partnership enables the creation of practical cybersecurity solutions for specific industries, as well as for broad, cross-sector technology challenges. Through consortia under Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), including technology partners—from Fortune 50 market leaders to smaller companies specializing in IT security—the NCCoE applies standards and best practices to develop modular, easily adaptable example cybersecurity solutions using commercially available technology. The NCCoE documents these example solutions in the NIST Special Publication 1800 series, which maps capabilities to the NIST Cyber Security Framework and details the steps needed for another entity to recreate the example solution. The NCCoE was established in 2012 by NIST in partnership with the State of Maryland and Montgomery County, Md. To learn more about the NCCoE, visit https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/.

NIST CYBERSECURITY PRACTICE GUIDES NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guides (Special Publication Series 1800) target specific cybersecurity challenges in the public and private sectors. They are practical, user-friendly guides that facilitate the adoption of standards-based approaches to cybersecurity. They show members of the information security community how to implement example solutions that help them align more easily with relevant standards and best practices and provide users with the materials lists, configuration files, and other information they need to implement a similar approach. The documents in this series describe example implementations of cybersecurity practices that businesses and other organizations may voluntarily adopt. These documents do not describe regulations or mandatory practices, nor do they carry statutory authority. ABSTRACT To protect power generation, transmission, and distribution, energy companies need to control physical and logical access to their resources, including buildings, equipment, information technology (IT), and operational technology (OT). They must authenticate, with a high degree of certainty, authorized individuals to the devices and facilities to which the companies are giving access rights. In addition, they need to enforce access-control policies (e.g., allow, deny, inquire further) consistently, uniformly, and quickly across all of their resources. This project resulted from direct dialog among NCCoE staff and members of the electricity subsector, mainly from electric power companies and those who provide equipment and/or services to them. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a converged, standards- based technical approach that unifies identity and access management (IdAM) functions across OT networks, physical access control systems (PACS), and IT systems. These networks often operate independently, which can result in identity and access information disparity, increased costs, inefficiencies, and a loss of capacity and service delivery capability. Also, these networks support different infrastructures, each with unique security risks. The converged IdAM solution must be constructed to effectively address the highest-risk infrastructure. This guide describes our collaborativeNIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities iii This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. efforts with technology providers and electric-company stakeholders to address the security challenges that energy providers face in the core function of IdAM. This guide offers a technical approach to meeting the challenge and also incorporates a business-value mindset by identifying the strategic considerations involved in implementing new technologies. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide provides a modular, open, end-to-end example solution that can be tailored and implemented by energy providers of varying sizes and levels of IT sophistication. It shows energy providers how we met the challenge by using open-source and commercially available tools and technologies that are consistent with cybersecurity standards. The use-case scenario is based on a normal day-to-day business operational scenario that provides the underlying impetus for the functionality presented in this guide. While the reference solution was demonstrated with a certain suite of products, this guide does not endorse these specific products. Instead, this guide presents the characteristics and capabilities that an organization’s security experts can use to identify similar standards-based products that can be integrated quickly and cost-effectively with an energy provider’s existing tools and infrastructure.

We cover all of the products employed in this reference design. We do not recreate the product manufacturers’ documentation, which is presumed to be widely available. Rather, these guides show how we incorporated the products together in our environment. Note: These are not comprehensive tutorials. There are many possible service and security configurations for these products that are out of scope for this reference design. 1.1 Practice Guide Structure This National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Practice Guide demonstrates a standards-based example solution and provides users with the information they need to replicate this approach to identity and access management (IdAM). This reference design is modular and can be deployed in whole or in parts. This guide contains three volumes:  NIST Special Publication (SP) 1800-2A: Executive Summary  NIST SP 1800-2B: Approach, Architecture, and Security Characteristics – what we built and why  NIST SP 1800-2C: How To Guides – instructions for building the example solution (you are here) Depending on your role in your organization, you might use this guide in different ways: Energy utility leaders, including chief security and technology officers will be interested in the Executive Summary (NIST SP 1800-2A), which describes the:  challenges enterprises face in implementing and using IdAM systems  example solution built at the NCCoE  benefits of adopting the example solution Technology or security program managers who are concerned with how to identify, understand, assess, and mitigate risk will be interested in this part of the guide, NIST SP 1800-2B, which describes what we did and why. The following sections will be of particular interest:  Section 4.4.3, Risk, provides a description of the risk analysis we performed  Section 4.4.4, Security Control Map, maps the security characteristics of this example solution to cybersecurity standards and best practicesNIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 2 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. You might share the Executive Summary, NIST SP 1800-2A, with your leadership team members to help them understand the importance of adopting standards-based identity and access management for electric utilities. IT professionals who want to implement an approach like this will find the whole practice guide useful. You can use the How-To portion of the guide, NIST SP 1800-2C, to replicate all or parts of the build created in our lab. The How-To guide provides specific product installation, configuration, and integration instructions for implementing the example solution. We do not recreate the product manufacturers’ documentation, which is generally widely available. Rather, we show how we incorporated the products together in our environment to create an example solution. This guide assumes that IT professionals have experience implementing security products within the enterprise. While we have used a suite of commercial products to address this challenge, this guide does not endorse these particular products. Your organization can adopt this solution or one that adheres to these guidelines in whole, or you can use this guide as a starting point for tailoring and implementing parts of IdAM for electric utilities. Your organization’s security experts should identify the products that will best integrate with your existing tools and IT system infrastructure. We hope you will seek products that are congruent with applicable standards and best practices. Section 4.5, Technologies, of NIST SP 1800-2B, lists the products we used and maps them to the cybersecurity controls provided by this reference solution. The security characteristics in our access management platform are informed by guidance and best practices from standards organizations, including the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards. In addition, this document was reviewed by the NERC Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ES-ISAC) to ensure that the approach was informed by standards and NERC regulations. 1.2 Typographic Conventions The following table presents typographic conventions used in this volume.

The infrastructure was built on Dell model PowerEdge R620 server hardware. The server operating system (OS) was the VMware vSphere virtualization operating environment. The use of virtualization is an artifact of the NCCoE laboratory environment. It allows the NCCoE build to represent a typical utility environment in the laboratory. The solution can be built on dedicated hardware. In addition, a 6-terabyte Dell EqualLogic network attached storage (NAS) product was used for storage. Dell model PowerConnect 7024 and Cisco Catalyst 3650 and 3550 physical switches were used to interconnect the server hardware, external network components, and the NAS. The lab network was accessible from the public internet via a virtual private network (VPN) appliance and firewall to enable secure internet and remote access. The lab network was not connected to the NIST enterprise network. Table 2-1 lists which software and hardware components were used in the builds, the specific function that each component contributes, and whether the product was installed within the virtual environment or as physical device.

The networks include a management network and a production network (Figure 2-1). The management network was implemented to facilitate the implementation, configuration, and management of the underlying infrastructure, including the physical servers, vSphere infrastructure, and monitoring. The production network (Figure 2-2) consists of the following components:NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 6 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2.  the demilitarized zone (DMZ): The DMZ presented in this practice guide is designed to support the NCCoE laboratory environment. Organizations should construct DMZs by using appropriate guidance for their environment, such as North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Guidance for Secure Interactive Remote Access.  IdAM network  IT network – business management system  operational technology (OT) network – ICS/SCADA and energy management system (EMS)  PACS network These networks were implemented separately to represent a typical electric utility enterprise infrastructure. Firewalls are configured to route traffic and limit access among the production networks to block all traffic, except required internetwork communications. The primary internetwork communications are the user access and authorization updates from the central IdAM systems to and from the directories and the PACS, IT, and OT networks. The DMZ provides a protected neutral network space that the other networks of the production network can use to route traffic to and from the internet or each other.NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 7 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2.

Figure 2-2 IdAM Build Implementation Production Network The IdAM network shown in Figure 2-2 represents the proposed converged IdAM network/system. This network was separated to highlight the unique IdAM components proposed to address the use-case requirements. The IT network represents the business management network that typically supports corporate email, file sharing, printing, and internet access for general business-purpose computing and communications. The OT network represents the network that is used to support the EMSs and ICS/SCADA systems. Typically, this network either is not connected to the enterprise IT network or is connected with a data diode (a one-way communication device from the OT network to the IT network). Two-way traffic is allowed, per NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), and is enabled via the OT firewall, only for specific ports and protocols between specific systems identified by IP address.NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 9 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. The PACS network represents the network that is used to support the PACS across the enterprise. In our architecture, a firewall is configured to allow limited access to and from the PACS network to facilitate the communication of access and authorization information. Technically, this communication consists of user role and responsibility directory updates originating in the IdAM system. The public internet is accessible by the lab environment to facilitate both cloud services and access for vendors and NCCoE administrators. The VPN firewall was the access-control point for vendors, to support the installation and configuration of their components of the architecture. The NCCoE also used this access to facilitate product training. This firewall also blocked unauthorized traffic from the public internet to the production networks. Additional firewalls are used to secure the multiple domain networks (IT, OT, IdAM, and PACS). Switching in the implementation is executed using a series of physical and hypervisor soft switches. The use of virtualization is an artifact of the NCCoE laboratory environment. It allows the NCCoE build to represent a typical utility environment in the laboratory. Virtual local area network (VLAN) switching functions are handled by physical Dell switches and the virtual environment. Routing was accomplished using the firewalls. 2.2 Build Implementation Descriptions Figure 2-3 depicts the build network comprising the management, VendorNet, IdAM, DMZ, IT, OT, and PACS subnetworks. VendorNet provides remote access for vendors to access, configure, demonstrate, and provide training for each of the implemented products. The IdAM network contains the central IdAM components of the build. The IT, OT, and PACS networks contain the representative components of a typical electric utility enterprise.NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 10 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2.

The Windows systems were installed using installation files provided by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). These images were chosen because they are standardized, hardened, and fully documented.The STIG guidelines are available online at 1F http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/Pages/index.aspx. The NCCoE chose this baseline configuration. Adopters of the NCCoE solution can use other accepted security baseline configurations, such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Security Benchmarks (https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/). Modifications to the STIG-compliant OS configurations were required for each product to enable its operation. The compliance results in Section 17 identify the specific OS configuration modifications (noncompliant configuration items) needed in each case. 3.1.2 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Installation and Hardening Details The SUSE OS was included as part of the virtual appliance image provided by RSA for the IMG product. The center did not make any OS configuration changes. The OS was not configured to meet the DoD CentOS 6 STIG. The OS configurations for the SUSE Linux implementation are listed in Section 17. The compliance results report for SUSE Linux is included for illustration purposes (Section 17.2). 3.1.3 Base Linux Installation and Hardening Details CentOS 7 was the NCCoE base Linux OS that was used in the build. This OS is available as an open-source image. The OS was configured to meet the DoD CentOS 6 STIG, as no CentOS 7 STIG was available at the time when the build was implemented. The OS configurations for each Linux implementation are listed in Section 17. The compliance results reports identify the configuration items that do not conform to the STIG configuration guide. 3.2 Firewall Configurations The firewalls were deployed to minimize the allowed traffic among the silo networks, as well as to minimize the traffic received from the DMZ and the public internet. The goal was to limit the cross- network traffic/connections to only those required to support the use case. The following firewall configurations include the rules that were implemented in each of the firewalls for the build implementation (Table 3-1 through Table 3-5). These configurations are provided to enable the reader to reproduce the traffic filtering/blocking that was achieved in the build implementation.

RTUs are used to collect data, such as voltage, current, and phase, from substation equipment. RTUs are also used to deliver commands via contact closures or output voltage to change device operations, such as switches, circuit breakers, or capacitors. 4.1 Transmission-Control-Protocol/Internet-Protocol RTU The TCP/IP RTU in this build is emulated with a Raspberry Pi 2 system. The system was developed to simulate a Modbus protocol programmable logic controller. 4.2 Serial RTU The serial RTU in this build is an SEL-2411 programmable automation controller that was configured to support the Modbus protocol. It is connected to the RADiFlow ICS Firewall via a serial interface. 5 Identity Services Engine and TrustSec-Enabled Switch: Cisco Cisco ISE controls the ability of devices to connect over the network. ISE expands on basic network address-based control to include the identity of the person using a device. ISE is used in the builds to provide a gateway function between IT and OT networks, limiting which users and devices are allowed to connect from IT to resources in OT. The Cisco ISE component should be installed in a VM on the IT network. This ISE component will be used in conjunction with the TrustSec switch that is located on the IT network, to control access from the IT network to the OT network. 5.1 Security Characteristics  Cybersecurity Framework Category: PR.PT-3: Access to systems and assets is controlled, incorporating the principle of least functionality.  NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Controls: AC-3, CM-7 5.2 Pre-Installation Task Obtain the Open Virtualization Archive (OVA) file from Cisco for Cisco ISE 1.4.

It receives input from an HR system, in the form of Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files. The access and authorization for each user is based on the business and security rules implemented in workflows within Identity Manager. The workflows include management approval chains as well as approval/denial data logging. Once Identity Manager has processed the access and authority request, the updated user access and authorization data is pushed to the central identity store. The central identity store contains the distribution mechanism for updating the various downstream (synchronized) directories with user access and authorization data. This process applies to new users, terminated users (disabled or deleted users), and any changes to a user profile. Changes include promotions, job responsibility changes, and any other change that would affect the systems that a user needs to access. 6.1 Security Characteristics Cybersecurity Framework Categories:  PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials are managed for authorized devices and users.  PR.AC-4: Access permissions are managed, incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-6, AC-16, IA Family CA Identity Manager is installed on the IdAM network on a VM running the Windows Server 2012 R2 OS.

It receives input from the central IdAM system (RSA IMG). The central identity store contains the distribution mechanism for updating the various downstream (synchronized) directories with user access and authorization data. This process applies to new users, terminated users (disabled or deleted users), and any changes to a user profile. Changes include promotions, job responsibility changes, and any other change that would affect the systems that a user needs to access. 8.1 Security Characteristics Cybersecurity Framework Categories: PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials are managed for authorized devices and users.

Figure 8-17 Adaptive Directory Add Attribute Repeat this procedure for any additional custom attributes that are required and for any additional AD backends to which you may need to add attributes. Your Adaptive Directory virtual directory is now complete and can be accessed from RSA IMG / Aveksa or from any other application that can access LDAP directories.NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 148 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. You can address this virtual directory by configuring the connecting application with the IP address or DNS name of the Adaptive Directory server and by using Port 2389. For the base DN, you would use the name of your virtual directory—in the above example, dc=master,dc=test and the relevant OU (backend AD cluster) that you want to access. You would use the same username (cn=Directory Manager) and password that you use to log into the application. For example, Figure 8-18 and Figure 8-19 show the connection information from RSA IMG to Adaptive Directory.

If you do not want RSA Adaptive Directory to chase referrals when searching the underlying LDAP server, you should check the Disable Referral Chasing option when you define the LDAP data source. Chasing referrals can affect the overall performance of RSA Adaptive Directory because, if the referral server is not responding (or is responding slowly), RSA Adaptive Directory could take a long time to respond to the client. For example, in the case of RSA Adaptive Directory querying an underlying Active Directory (with a base DN starting at the root of Active Directory), you may get entries like the following returned: ldaps://ForestDnsZones.na.radiantlogic.com:636… ldaps://DomainDnsZones.na.radiantlogic.com:636… RSA Adaptive Directory will attempt to “chase” these referrals, which can result in an extreme degradation in response times. Therefore, it is recommended that you disable referral chasing if you need RSA Adaptive Directory to connect to Active Directory starting at the root of the Active Directory tree, or if you need to connect to any other directory where you do not care about following referrals. 8.5.2 Limit Attributes Requested from the LDAP Backend Whenever RSA Adaptive Directory queries a backend LDAP, the default behavior is to ask for all attributes (although only the attributes requested in the query will be returned to the client). This default behavior of RSA Adaptive Directory is for the following reasons:  Joins have been configured, and the filter in the search request involves attributes from both the primary and secondary sources (i.e., the query filter contains conditions on both primary and secondary objects).  Interception scripts may involve logic that is based on attributes from the backend, and therefore require these attributes. These attributes may not be specifically requested or searched for by the client. However, RSA Adaptive Directory must retrieve these attributes from the backend for the script logic to be valid.  Access Control List (ACL) checking: You can set up ACLs based on attributes/values of an entry (e.g., mystatus=hidden); RSA Adaptive Directory may need the whole entry to check the authorization.  For entry caching, the entire entry needs to be in the entry cache. If your virtual view does not require all attributes to be requested for any of the conditions mentioned above, you can enable the option to limit the attributes that are requested, for better performance. If this option is enabled, RSA Adaptive Directory will query the backend server only for attributesNIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 150 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. requested from the client, in addition to the attributes that are set as Always Requested on the Attributes tab. 8.5.3 Process Joins and Computed Attributes Only When Necessary The default behavior of RSA Adaptive Directory is to process associated joins and to build computed attributes whenever a virtual object is reached from a query, regardless of whether the requested attributes come from a secondary source or a computation. If you enable the option to process joins and computed attributes only when necessary, RSA Adaptive Directory will not perform joins or computations when a client requests or searches for attributes from a primary object only. If a client requests or searches for attributes from secondary objects or computed attributes, RSA Adaptive Directory will process the join(s) and computations accordingly. Use caution when enabling this option, if you have interception scripts defined on these objects, or if access controls based on filters are being used (both of which may require other attributes returned from secondary sources or from computations, regardless of whether or not the client requested or searched for them). 8.5.4 Use the Client Sizelimit Value to Query the Backend Whenever Adaptive Directory queries a backend LDAP, the default behavior is to ask for all entries (sizelimit=0), even if the client to Adaptive Directory indicates a size limit. This is the default behavior because the entries that are returned by the backend are possible candidates, but may not be retained for the final result that is sent to the client. For example, if an ACL has been defined in Adaptive Directory, not all entries from the backend may be authorized for the user (who is connected to Adaptive Directory) to access. As another example, when joins or interception scripts are involved with the virtual view, they may also alter the entries that match the client’s search. To limit the number of entries from the backend, the recommended approach is to use paging. If the backend supports paging, Adaptive Directory will not get all of the results at once; rather, it will get only one page at a time (the page size is indicated in the configuration). In this case, if Adaptive Directory has returned, to the client, the size limit that is required, Adaptive Directory will not go to the next page. If your virtual view does not involve any of the conditions mentioned above (joins, interceptions, ACL), and if using paging between Adaptive Directory and the backend is not possible, you can enable the Client Sizelimit value option to limit the number of entries requested from the backend. If this option is enabled, Adaptive Directory will use the size limit specified by the client, instead of using sizelimit=0, when querying the backend. 9 Enterprise Guardian: AlertEnterprise AlertEnterprise Enterprise Guardian (Guardian) is installed on the IdAM network, in a VM running the Windows Server 2012 R2 OS. Guardian is used to control privileged user access to the components located on the network OT systems. Guardian collects user authorization information from the AD located within the OT network.

You must perform these configurations through the database administrator login. The current version of AlertEnterprise products supports Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases. The NCCoE build also supports MySQL server database. To configure the database server, follow these steps:NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 157 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. Create a schema / system identifier (SID) per your naming convention in the database server. The steps to create a schema can be different with different database management systems. Refer to the administrators guide for the database management system installed at your landscape. Create a new user with full access to the created schema. Run the included SQL files, or and AlertReport471.ddl AlertReport471.sql , on the new schema created. This step should be performed while installing AlertQuartz.sql the AlertEnterprise application for the first time. 9.2.3.7 Avoiding Case-Sensitivity Issues in Alert DB To avoid case-sensitivity issues while using the search and sort functionalities in the AlertEnterprise applications, enable a “Case Insensitiveness” search in the database. By default, it is set as case- sensitive. Follow these steps to avoid case-sensitivity issues: Create a trigger to support case insensitiveness. /***********/ create or replace trigger set_nls_onlogon AFTER LOGON ON SCHEMA DECLARE BEGIN EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET NLS_SORT="BINARY_CI"'; EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET NLS_COMP="LINGUISTIC"'; END set_nls_onlogon; /************/ Restart the AlertEnterprise Application server. The effect may not be visible in some client tools, such as SQL Developer. To see the effect in the SQL Developer tool, follow these steps: Open SQL Developer, and click Tools > Preferences. Click Database > NLS, and perform the following actions: a. Set the Sort option to BINARY_CI. b. Set the Comparison option to LINGUISTIC. 9.2.3.8 Enabling Support for International Characters Storage of character data is controlled by a character-set setting at the database level. It is recommended to have the following database settings to support international characters:NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 158 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2.

It was installed on the OT network to control and monitor access between OT technicians and physical devices, such as the RTUs and the RADiFlow ICS firewall. The following subsections provide details on the steps that are needed to install and configure each of these servers.NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 225 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. 11.1 Security Characteristics Cybersecurity Framework Categories:  PR.PT-1: Audit/log records are determined, documented, implemented, and reviewed in accordance with policy.  PR.PT-3: Access to systems and assets is controlled, incorporating the principle of least functionality. NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Controls: AU Family, AC-3, CM-7 11.2 ConsoleWorks Server Installation ConsoleWorks was installed on the OT network to control and monitor access between OT technicians and physical devices, such as the RTUs and the RADiFlow ICS firewall. ConsoleWorks uses the OT directory to authenticate users who are requesting access to these devices. It also establishes a permanent SSH or telnet connection to each of the RTUs and ICS firewall by using pre-established usernames and passwords. As users request access and are authenticated, ConsoleWorks makes the cross-connection from the user to the specific SSH or telnet session to allow access. Once the cross- connection is established, the user has access to the device to make any changes needed. When users complete their task, they log off the connection, and ConsoleWorks removes the cross-connect between the user and the SSH or telnet session. ConsoleWorks logs all user access requests and all of the traffic on the session, and can alert on any pre- defined aspect of the traffic. Directory-based authentication is used to manage the user access in near-real-time. On the OT network, the ConsoleWorks Server is installed on a VM that is running the Windows Server 2012 R2 (hardened server OS) image, as explained in Section 3.1.1. 11.2.1 System Environment The system for the OT Network ConsoleWorks Server configured by the NCCoE contains the following configuration settings and environmental constraints:  Windows Server 2012 R2 OS  VM with CPU Quad Core 2.199 GHz  VM with 8,192 MB of memory  virtual hard disk containing 240 GB of storageNIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 226 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. 11.2.2 ConsoleWorks Server Installation on the OT Network After installing the OS, download the TDi Technologies Installer from http://support.tditechnologies.com/get_consoleworks. Launch the cw_server_v4.9-0u0.exe application. The installer requires administrative privileges to execute. When prompted by Windows User Account Control, select Yes to continue. The ConsoleWorks Server InstallShield wizard should display a welcome message. Select Next to continue. When prompted by the InstallShield wizard to accept the license agreement, read carefully. If you agree with the license terms, select Next to continue with the installation. Enter the User Name and Organization fields, then select Next to continue. Select Complete when prompted for setup type, then select Next to continue. Click Install to begin the installation of the ConsoleWorks Server. After the InstallShield wizard has completed, ensure that Launch upgrade script (if upgrading from 32-bit) is unchecked. Select Finish. 11.2.3 Post-Installation Configuration of ConsoleWorks on the OT Network Copy TDi Technologies license key files into C:\ProgramData\ConsoleWorks/Server\LMF\TDI_Licenses Go to Start > Run > services.msc. Right-click on the ConsoleWorks Server Service, and then select Properties. Select Start to start the service, and then change the Startup Type from Manual to Automatic.

It is recommended that you have "root" privilege to set up the software. Tips for using this program: - Press "Enter" to choose the default and go to the next screen - Type "Control-B" or the word "back" then "Enter" to go back to the previous screen - Type "Control-C" to cancel the setup program Would you like to continue with set up? [yes]: yes ======================================================================= Your system has been scanned for potential problems, missing patches, etc. The following output is a report of the items found that need to be addressed before running this software in a production environment.NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 239 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. 389 Directory Server system tuning analysis version 23-FEBRUARY-2012. NOTICE : System is x86_64-unknown-linux3.8.13-68.2.2.el7uek.x86_64 (1 processor). NOTICE : The net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time is set to 7200000 milliseconds (120 minutes). This may cause temporary server congestion from lost client connections. WARNING: There are only 1024 file descriptors (soft limit) available, which limit the number of simultaneous connections. WARNING : The warning messages above should be reviewed before proceeding. Would you like to continue? [no]: yes ======================================================================= Choose a setup type: 1. Express Allows you to quickly set up the servers using the most common options and pre-defined defaults. Useful for quick evaluation of the products. 2. Typical Allows you to specify common defaults and options. 3. Custom Allows you to specify more advanced options. This is recommended for experienced server administrators only.NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 240 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. To accept the default shown in brackets, press the Enter key. Choose a setup type : 2 ======================================================================= Enter the fully qualified domain name of the computer on which you're setting up server software. Using the form <hostname>.<domainname> Example: eros.example.com. To accept the default shown in brackets, press the Enter key. Warning: This step may take a few minutes if your DNS servers cannot be reached or if DNS is not configured correctly. If you would rather not wait, hit Ctrl-C and run this program again with the following command line option to specify the hostname: General.FullMachineName=your.hostname.domain.name Computer name [ozone.mountaireygroup.com]: ozoneauthority.nccoe.test ======================================================================= The server must run as a specific user in a specific group. It is strongly recommended that this user should have no privileges on the computer (i.e. a non-root user). The setup procedure will give this user/group some permissions in specific paths/files to perform server-specific operations. If you have not yet created a user and group for the server, create this user and group using your native operatingNIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 241 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. system utilities. System User [nobody]: nobody System Group [nobody]: nobody ======================================================================= The standard directory server network port number is 389. However, if you are not logged as the superuser, or port 389 is in use, the default value will be a random unused port number greater than 1024. If you want to use port 389, make sure that you are logged in as the superuser, that port 389 is not in use. Directory server network port : 389 ======================================================================= Each instance of a directory server requires a unique identifier. This identifier is used to name the various instance specific files and directories in the file system, as well as for other uses as a server instance identifier. Directory server identifier [ozoneauthority]: ozoneauthority ======================================================================= The suffix is the root of your directory tree. The suffix must be a valid DN. It is recommended that you use the dc=domaincomponent suffix convention. For example, if your domain is example.com, you should use dc=example,dc=com for your suffix. Setup will create this initial suffix for you, but you may have more than one suffix. Use the directory server utilities to create additional suffixes.NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 242 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. Suffix [dc=nccoe, dc=test]: dc=nccoe, dc=test ======================================================================= Certain directory server operations require an administrative user. This user is referred to as the Directory Manager and typically has a bind Distinguished Name (DN) of cn=Directory Manager. You will also be prompted for the password for this user. The password must be at least 8 characters long, and contain no spaces. Press Control-B or type the word "back", then Enter to back up and start over.

The certificates were used in conjunction with the MAG Ozone product to provide high-assurance attributes for the Personal Profile Application. The application has three main information groups for which actions can be authorized: Personal Information, Credit Reports, and Criminal History. Based on the authorizations associated with a credential, results pages are dynamically populated.NIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 266 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2.

GlobalSign is an active participant of the NAESB Cyber-Security standards committee and is an NAESB-authorized Certificate Authority (CA). For more information about NAESB, go to https://www.naesb.org/. GlobalSign’s NAESB-compliant certificate-based authentication solution is managed through a software as a service (SaaS) that is accessed through a web-based portal. The web portal gives organizations control of digital IDs that are issued to individuals, by using one of four NIST-defined assurance levels. Set-up usually takes fewer than three days. Another advantage of the web portal is that all of theNIST SP 1800-2C: Identity and Access Management for Electric Utilities 267 This publication is available free of charge from: http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-2. life-cycle functions, including issuance, re-issuance, renewal, and revocation, are available to the administrator. 15.1.1 Managing the Account The account is managed using the GlobalSign Certificate Center (GCC). GCC is a web-based interface allowing members to access their certificates anywhere where they have an internet connection. Within the platform, administrators may add additional users and may delegate some or all certificate management functions. 15.1.2 What Is a Profile? / Profile Management A profile, or certificate profile, contains the organization’s identity information that will be used for all NAESB WEQ-12 digital certificates issued from the account. Organization identity information includes the organization legal name, country code, and optionally locality, state, and up to three fixed organization units, as well as assurance level. 15.1.3 What Is a License? GlobalSign NAESB digital certificates are sold in “license packs” (i.e., in quantities of 5, 10, 25, 50, etc.). GlobalSign NAESB digital certificates are valid for either one or two years, and must be issued within 12 months of license ordering. 15.2 Security Characteristics Cybersecurity Framework Categories: PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials are managed for authorized devices and users.

The reports for each installation are provided in the following subsections. Neither the Windows 7 Console on the IT network nor the OT Management Windows 7 Workstation on the OT network were STIG- compliant installations; therefore, compliance reports for those OSs are not provided. The Linux implementations (except SUSE Linux) were configured to meet the DoD CentOS 6 STIG, as no CentOS 7 STIG was available at the time the build was implemented. The STIG guidelines are available at http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/Pages/index.aspx. The OS configurations for each Linux implementation are listed below.
