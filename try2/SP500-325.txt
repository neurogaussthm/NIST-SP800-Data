This exponential increase is fueled by the proliferation of mobile devices (e.g. mobile phones and tablets), smart sensors serving different vertical markets (e.g. smart power grids, autonomous transportation, industrial controls, smart cities3, wearables, etc), wireless sensors and actuators networks. New concepts and technologies are needed to manage this growing fleet of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. T 1.1 Purpose and Scope h is p u The acute need of the multitude of smart, end-user IoT devices and near-user edge devices b lic to carry out, with minimal latency, a substantial amount of data processing and to collaborate in a a tio distributed way, triggered technology advancements towards adaptive, decentralized n is computational paradigms that complement the centralized cloud computing model serving IoT a v networks. a ila b Researchers, computer scientists, system and network engineers developed innovative le fre solutions to fill the technological gaps. These solutions provide faster approaches that gain better e o situational awareness in a far more timely manner. Such solutions or computational paradigms are cf referred to as fog computing, mist computing, cloudlets4, or edge computing5,6.

The model facilitates the deployment of distributed, latency-aware applications and services, and consists of fog nodes8 (physical or virtual), residing between smart end-devices and centralized (cloud) services. The fog nodes are context aware and support a T common data management and communication system. They can be organized in clusters - either h is vertically (to support isolation), horizontally (to support federation), or relative to fog nodes’ p u b latency-distance to the smart end-devices. Fog computing minimizes the request-response time lic a from/to supported applications, and provides, for the end-devices, local computing resources and, tio n when needed, network connectivity to centralized services. is a v a ila b le fre e o cf h a rg e fro m : h ttp s ://d o i.o rg /1 0 .6 0 2 8 N/ IS T .S P .5 0 0 -3 2 5 Figure 1 – Fog computing supporting a cloud-based ecosystem for smart end-devices. Figure 1 above depicts fog computing in the broader context of a cloud-based ecosystem serving smart end-devices. Fog computing is not perceived as a mandatory layer for such ecosystems nor is the centralized (cloud) service perceived as being required for a fog computing layer to support the functionality of smart end-devices. Diferent usecase scenarios might have diferent architectures based on the optimal approach to supporting end-devices functionality. The choice 8 See Section 2.2 for the conceptual model of a fog node. 2 T h is p u b lic a tio n is a v a ila b le fr e e o f c h a r g e fr o m : h ttp ://d x .d o i.o r g /1 0 .6 0 2 8 N/ IS T .S P .5 0 0 - 3 2 5NIST SP 500-325 FOG COMPUTING CONCEPTUAL MODEL of such representation is rooted in the intend of capturing a complex architecture that incorporates fog computing services. 2.2 Fog Node The fog node is the core component of the fog computing architecture. Fog nodes are either physical components (e.g. gateways, switches, routers, servers, etc.) or virtual components (e.g. virtualized switches, virtual machines, cloudlets9, etc.) that are tightly coupled with the smart end- devices or access networks, and provide computing resources to these devices. A fog node is aware of its geographical distribution and logical location within the context of its cluster. Additionally, fog nodes provide some form of data management and communication services between network’s T h is edge layer where end-devices reside, and the fog computing service or the centralized (cloud) p u computing resources, when needed. To deploy a given fog computing capability, fog nodes operate b lic in centralized or decentralized manner and can be configured as stand-alone fog nodes that a tio communicate among them to deliver the service or can be federated to form clusters that provide n is horizontal scalability over disperse geolocations, through mirroring or extension mechanisms. a v a ila b 2.3 Fog Computing Essential Characteristics le fre e The following six characteristics are essential in distinguishing fog computing from other o cf computing paradigms. However, a smart end-device or IoT user is not required to make use of all h a characteristics when consuming a fog computing service. rg e fro m C lao ten nt ce yx t du ua el tl oo c ta ht ei o fn o ga w noa dr ee sn ’e s as w, aa rn ed ne l so sw o fla tt he en ic r y l. o gF io cg a lc lo om cap tu ioti nn g in o f thfe er s c oth ne te l xo tw oe fs t t- hp eo ess ni tb irl ee : h ttp sytems and of the latency costs for communicating with other nodes. The origins of fog s ://d computing can be traced to early proposals supporting endpoints with rich services at the edge o of the network, including applications with low latency requirements. Because fog nodes are i.o rg often co-located with the smart end-devices, analysis and response to data generated by these /1 devices is much quicker than from a centralized cloud service or data center. 0 .6 0 2 Geographical distribution. In sharp contrast to the more centralized cloud, the services and 8 N/ applications targeted by the fog computing demand widely, but geographically-identifiable, IS T distributed deployments. For instance, the fog computing will play an active role in delivering .S P high quality streaming services to moving vehicles, through proxies and access points .5 0 geographically positioned along highways and tracks. 0 -3 2 Heterogeneity. Fog computing supports collection and processing of data of different form 5 factors acquired through multiple types of network communication capabilities. Interoperability and federation. Seamless support of certain services (real-time streaming services is a good example) requires the cooperation of different providers. Hence, fog computing components must be able to interoperate, and services must be federated across domains. Real-time interactions. Fog computing applications involve real-time interactions rather than batch processing. 9 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudlet 3 T h is p u b lic a tio n is a v a ila b le fr e e o f c h a r g e fr o m : h ttp ://d x .d o i.o r g /1 0 .6 0 2 8 N/ IS T .S P .5 0 0 - 3 2 5NIST SP 500-325 FOG COMPUTING CONCEPTUAL MODEL Scalability and agility of federated, fog-node clusters. Fog computing is adaptive in nature, at cluster or cluster-of-clusters level, supporting elastic compute, resource pooling, data-load changes, and network condition variations, to list a few of the supported adaptive functions. 2.4 Additional Characteristics Often Associated with Fog Computing Predominance of wireless access. Although fog computing is used in wired environments, the large scale of wireless sensors in IoT demand distributed analytics and compute. For this reason, fog computing is very well suited to wireless IoT access networks. Support for mobility. It is essential for many fog computing applications to communicate T directly with mobile devices, and therefore support mobility techniques, such as the Locator/ID h is p Separation Protocol (LISP)10, that decouple host identity from location identity, and require a u b distributed directory system. lic a tio n is 2.5 Fog Node Attributes a v a ila To facilitate the deployment of a fog computing capability that exhibits the six essential b le characteristics described in Section 2.3, fog nodes need to support one or more of the following fre attributes: e o cf Autonomy. Fog nodes can operate independently, making local decisions, at the node or h a cluster-of-nodes level. rg e fro m H vae rt ie etr yo g oe f n ee ni vty ir. o F nmog e nn to s.d es come in different form factors, and can be deployed in a wide : h ttp Hierarchical clustering. Fog nodes support hierarchical structures, with different layers s ://d providing different subsets of service functions while working together as a continuum. o i.o Manageability. Fog nodes are managed and orchestrated by complex systems that can perform rg /1 most routine operations automatically. 0 .6 0 Programmability. Fog nodes are inherently programmable at multiple levels, by multiple 2 8 N/ stakeholders - such as network operators, domain experts, equipment providers, or end users. IS T .S P 2.6 Fog Node Architectural Service Models .5 0 0 -3 Fog computing, similar to the traditional cloud computing model, offers implementations of the 2 5 architecture in multiple layers of the network’s topology. Similar to the cloud computing service models defined in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-145, the following types of service models can be implemented: 10 Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP): is a network architecture and set of protocols that implements a new semantic for IP addressing. LISP creates two namespaces and uses two IP addresses: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), which are assigned to end- hosts, and Routing Locators (RLOCs), which are assigned to devices (primarily routers) that make up the global routing system.

The capability provided to the fog service customer is to use the fog provider’s applications running on a cluster of federated fog nodes managed by the provider. This type of service is similar to the cloud computing Software as a Service (SaaS) and implies that the end-device or smart thing accesses the fog node’s applications through a thin client interface or a program interface. The end-user does not manage or control the underlying fog node’s infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.

The capability provided to the fog service customer is similar to the cloud computing Platform as a Service (PaaS) and allows deployment onto the platforms T of federated fog nodes forming a cluster, of customer-created or acquired applications created h is p using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the fog service u b provider. The fog service customer does not manage or control the underlying fog platform(s) lic a and infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control tio n over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting is a environment. v a ila Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

A fog node that is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization N/ IS comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units.) It may be owned, managed, and operated T .S by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off P .5 premises. 0 0 -3 Community fog node. A fog node that is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific 2 5 community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations.) It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. Public fog node. A fog node that is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the fog provider. Hybrid fog node.

The need for geographically dispersed, low-latency computational resources triggered the technological evolution of fog computing promoting development of more specialized, dedicated nodes that exhibit low computational resources. These nodes referred to as mist nodes, are perceived as lightweight fog nodes. These mist nodes that form the mist computing layer are placed even closer to the peripheral T h is devices than the more powerful fog nodes they collaborate with, often sharing the same locality p u with the smart end-devices they service. b lic a tio n 2.9 Mist Computing is a v Mist computing is a lightweight and rudimentary form of fog computing that resides directly within a ila the network fabric11 at the edge of the network fabric, bringing the fog computing layer closer to b le fre the smart end-devices. Mist computing uses microcomputers and microcontrollers to feed into fog e computing nodes and potentially onward towards the centralized (cloud) computing services. o cf The mist computing layer is not viewed as a mandatory layer of fog computing.

This peripheral layer is also often referred to as IoT network. Fog computing is often erroneously confused with edge computing, but there are key differences12 between the two concepts. Fog computing runs applications in a multi-layer architecture that decouples and meshes the hardware and software functions, allowing for dynamic reconfigurations for different applications while performing intelligent computing and transmission services. Edge T h is computing runs specific applications in a fixed logic location and provides a direct transmission p u service. Fog computing is hierarchical, where edge computing tends to be limited to a small b lic number of peripheral devices. Moreover, in addition to computation, and networking, fog a tio n computing also addresses storage, control and data-processing acceleration. is a v a ila b le fre e o cf h a rg e fro m : h ttp s ://d o i.o rg /1 0 .6 0 2 8 N/ IS T .S P .5 0 0 -3 2 5 12 See OpenFog Consortium’s whitepaper: https://www.nebbiolo.tech/wp-content/uploads/whitepaper-fog-vs-edge.pdf 7 T h is p u b lic a tio n is a v a ila b le fr e e o f c h a r g e fr o m : h ttp ://d x .d o i.o r g /1 0 .6 0 2 8 N/ IS T .S P .5 0 0 - 3 2 5NIST SP 500-325 FOG COMPUTING CONCEPTUAL MODEL Acronyms Selected acronyms and abbreviations used in this paper are defined below.
