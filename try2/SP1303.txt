Locascio, NIST Director and Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology October 2024NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0: Enterprise Risk Management Quick-Start Guide This guide provides an introduction to using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 for planning and integrating an enterprise-wide process for cybersecurity risk management information, as a subset of information and communications technology risk management, into enterprise risk management. The use of CSF common language and outcomes supports the integration of risk monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment across various organizational units and programs. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) When we use the word enterprise in an organizational context, we mean all aspects of that organization, spanning the entire breadth and depth of that org chart. ERM exists at the top level of the organizational hierarchy and spans risk considerations such as mission, financial, reputation, and technical risks thereof. ERM calls for understanding the core risks that an enterprise faces, determining how best to address those risks, and ensuring that the necessary actions are taken. An ERM program allows enterprises to aggregate, prioritize, and analyze risks from across the enterprise in a common risk register format. Risk appetite expressed by the ERM program helps inform risk identification. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Risk Management ERM The information and communications technology (ICT) on which an enterprise relies is managed through a broad set of risk disciplines that include privacy, supply chain, and cybersecurity. ICT extends beyond traditional information technology (IT) considerations. Many entities rely on operational technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices’ sensors or actuators for bridging physical and digital environments. Increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) factors into enterprise risk. NIST SPs 800-221 and 800-221A provide more information. ICT RM Cybersecurity Risk Management (CSRM) Cybersecurity risks are a fundamental type of risk for all organizations to manage. Potential negative impacts to organizations from CSRM cybersecurity risks include higher costs, lower revenue, reputational damage, and the impairment of innovation. Cybersecurity risks also threaten individuals’ privacy and access to essential services and can result in life-or-death consequences. Risk appetite expressed at other levels of risk management gets translated into more specific CSRM risk tolerance, such that cyber risks can be more easily identified. CSF 2.0 provides guidance for reducing cybersecurity risks by helping organizations discuss, organize, and address gaps in their cybersecurity program in a standard way. The cybersecurity outcomes described in CSF affect cybersecurity, ICT, and enterprise risks. Understanding these dependencies is an essential activity in CSRM, ICT RM, and ERM. The Cybersecurity Risk Register (CSRR) described in the NIST IR 8286 series of publications enables organizations to identify, manage, and monitor the relationships between discrete risks and aspects of a CSF- based cybersecurity program that address those risks. The CSRR allows organizations to identify, organize, analyze, and report on cybersecurity risks at the system level. CSF Organizational Profiles are a natural byproduct of a comprehensive CSRR, because the relative priority of CSF outcomes becomes apparent based on how significant the impacts of identified cybersecurity risks might be to the organization’s priorities, such as its strategic objectives, products and services, or customers.NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0: Enterprise Risk Management Quick-Start Guide CSF 2.0 Supports Six Activity Points For Informing, Implementing, and Monitoring ERM CSF 2.0 is a valuable guide for helping to review and improve security and privacy considerations as part of a holistic enterprise risk approach. CSF is most helpful when it is paired with other ERM elements. For example, as agency officials and corporate boards provide oversight of all relevant risks, the CSF process helps ensure that cybersecurity strategy is well-executed. Managers plan and implement risk treatment based on that strategy, record and report progress, and provide agency/ business leaders with information needed for effective operations and mission success. The Activity Points, which are further described in subsequent pages, include: • 1 – Leaders define and record enterprise mission, priorities, and risk appetite. Accountability is assigned for managing both positive and negative types of risk. (GV.OC, GV.RM, GV.SC) • 2 – Organization-level managers interpret risk appetite into specific guidance regarding security and privacy requirements, and associated risk tolerance. (GV.RR, GV.PO, ID.RA) • 3 – Risk strategy and requirements aid implementation of shared security solutions and system- level controls to achieve an acceptable level of risk. (PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER) • 4 – Risk response outcomes are reflected as residual risk in system-level risk registers as part of ongoing assessment and continuous monitoring activities.

Risk managers evaluate threats and opportunities, in alignment with risk strategy and direction from enterprise- and organization-level guidance. They determine the benefits of the following responses: Mitigate, Accept, Avoid, and Transfer for negative risks; Realize, Share, Enhance, and Accept for positive risks. Analyze and Prioritize Risks There are benefits to both qualitative and quantitative risk analysis methodologies and even the use of multiple methodologies, based on enterprise strategy, organization preference, and data availability (ID.RA). The relative priority of various types of risk must be decided upon by those with appropriate authority, usually through guidance provided through the risk management strategy (GV.RM). Communicate Risk Findings and Decisions The cybersecurity risk register (CSRR) provides a location to record and communicate the known system-level threats and vulnerabilities, their impact on business objectives, and the responses taken or planned. Risk managers share information about residual risk, including metrics that support ongoing assessment and authorization, and plans of actions & milestones for maintaining the appropriate level of risk based on stakeholders’ expectations (as expressed in the target state of the Organizational Profiles, especially the GOVERN and IDENTIFY functions). Questions to Consider How do CSF Target Profile outcomes (organizational agreement on how to best protect, detect, respond, and recover) inform system-specific risk assessment and treatment? How can we estimate likelihood and impact of those risks given the planned outcomes and knowledge from previous results? Is our risk response proportionate to the exposure?

As risk management is applied through various controls (as described above), the results are continually evaluated for effectiveness. CSF provides examples of how to do this through CSF Informative References, described at the Online Informative References (OLIR) web site. At the organization level, the results of various system-level activities and results (as reflected in CSRRs) are aggregated and normalized. Managers monitor how well the cyber risk strategy is being implemented, evaluate indicators to confirm performance goals and highlight potential changes in the risk landscape, and then make any adjustments necessary to accentuate achievement of opportunities (positive risk) and reduce impactful threat conditions to an acceptable level. This cycle enables creation and maintenance of an organization-level CSRR, and updates to the Organizational Profiles to reflect refined current state and adjusted Target State.

As risk management controls are operated, performance is evaluated and adjusted to improve effectiveness and efficiency. Feedback from the MEA cycle sometimes results in more than just adjustments to controls and other Informative References. Feedback may lead to adjustments in: • CSF Profile • Risk Tolerance • Risk Detail Record • Risk Appetite • Risk Response Description • Policy • Risk Response • Strategy This helps report results back to management and enterprise leadership. Results that particularly reflect operational achievement (key performance indicators, or KPIs) confirm conformance with the strategy (GV.RM, GV.SC). This also supports personnel performance monitoring and reporting (GV.RR, GV.PO). Managers integrate data from normalized and harmonized risk registers and from organization-level reports, compliance and audit reports. These are considered in light of non-technology risk management activities (e.g., credit risk, market risk, labor Questions to Consider risk).
