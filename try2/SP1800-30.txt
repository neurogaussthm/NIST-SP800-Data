February 2022 FINAL This publication is available free of charge from https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30 The second draft of this publication is available free of charge from: https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/legacy-files/rpm-nist-sp1800-30-2nd-draft.pdfExecutive Summary Increasingly, healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) are relying on telehealth and remote patient monitoring (RPM) capabilities to treat patients at home. RPM is convenient and cost-effective, and its adoption rate has increased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Without adequate privacy and cybersecurity measures, however, unauthorized individuals may expose sensitive data or disrupt patient monitoring services. In collaboration with industry partners, the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) built a laboratory environment to demonstrate how HDOs can implement cybersecurity and privacy controls to enhance telehealth RPM resiliency. CHALLENGE Telehealth RPM solutions deploy components across multiple infrastructure domains that are maintained uniquely. When HDOs deploy RPM solutions, those solutions implement architectures that distribute components across the HDO, telehealth platform providers, and patient homes. Each of these respective environments is managed by different groups of people, often with different sets of resources and technical capabilities. Risks are distributed across the solution architecture, and the methods by which one may mitigate those risks vary in complexity. While HDOs do not have the ability to manage and deploy privacy and cybersecurity controls unilaterally, they retain the responsibility to ensure that appropriate controls and risk mitigation are applied. This practice guide can help your organization:  Identify risks associated with the solution architecture  Apply the NIST Privacy Framework to broaden understanding of risk  Assure that HDOs partner with appropriate telehealth platform providers to extend privacy and cybersecurity control deployment, management, and efficacy  Consider future technologies that augment data communications safeguards SOLUTION Technology solutions alone may not be sufficient to maintain privacy and security controls on external environments. This practice guide notes the involvement of people, process, and technology as necessary to implement a holistic risk mitigation strategy. When developing this practice guide, the NCCoE team applied risk assessment approaches to determine where risks may occur and used assessment processes to identify applicable controls. The NCCoE collaborated with healthcare, technology, and telehealth partners to build a distributed RPM solution. The RPM solution implemented controls that safeguard the HDO environment and documented approaches that the telehealth platform provider addresses. Telehealth platform providers assure that RPM components are isolated within the patient home environment. The telehealth platform provider assures end-to-end data security between the patient and the HDO.

NIST CYBERSECURITY PRACTICE GUIDES NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guides (Special Publication 1800 series) target specific cybersecurity challenges in the public and private sectors. They are practical, user-friendly guides that facilitate the adoption of standards-based approaches to cybersecurity. They show members of the information security community how to implement example solutions that help them align with relevant standards and best practices and provide users with the lists of materials, configuration files, and other information they need to implement a similar approach. The documents in this series describe example implementations of cybersecurity practices that businesses and other organizations may voluntarily adopt. These documents do not describe regulations or mandatory practices nor do they carry statutory authority. ABSTRACT Increasingly, healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) are relying on telehealth and remote patient monitoring (RPM) capabilities to treat patients at home. RPM is convenient and cost-effective, and its adoption rate has increased. However, without adequate privacy and cybersecurity measures, unauthorized individuals may expose sensitive data or disrupt patient monitoring services. RPM solutions engage multiple actors as participants in patients’ clinical care. These actors include HDOs, telehealth platform providers, and the patients themselves. Each participant uses, manages, and maintains different technology components within an interconnected ecosystem, and each is NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem iii This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.responsible for safeguarding their piece against unique threats and risks associated with RPM technologies. This practice guide assumes that the HDO engages with a telehealth platform provider that is a separate entity from the HDO and patient. The telehealth platform provider manages a distinct infrastructure, applications, and set of services. The telehealth platform provider coordinates with the HDO to provision, configure, and deploy the RPM components to the patient home and assures secure communication between the patient and clinician. The NCCoE analyzed RPM ecosystem risk factors by applying methods described in the NIST Risk Management Framework. The NCCoE also leveraged the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST Privacy Framework, and other relevant standards to identify measures to safeguard the ecosystem. In collaboration with healthcare, technology, and telehealth partners, the NCCoE built an RPM ecosystem in a laboratory environment to explore methods to improve the cybersecurity of an RPM. Technology solutions alone may not be sufficient to maintain privacy and security controls on external environments. This practice guide notes the application of people, process, and technology as necessary to implement a holistic risk mitigation strategy. This practice guide’s benefits include helping organizations assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an RPM solution, enhancing patient privacy and limiting HDO risk when implementing an RPM solution.

from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.1 Summary This practice guide demonstrates how healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) can implement cybersecurity and privacy controls to enhance the resiliency of telehealth services. In collaboration with industry partners, the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) built a laboratory environment to simulate the telehealth ecosystem and enable remote patient monitoring (RPM) services for patients. RPM is convenient, cost-effective, and growing, but it comes with security and privacy risks. Patient monitoring systems are often found in controlled healthcare facility environments. RPM is different in that monitoring equipment is deployed in the patient’s home, which may not offer the same level of cybersecurity or physical security control to prevent misuse or compromise. Without privacy or cybersecurity controls in place within the RPM ecosystem, patient data and the ability to communicate with the care providers may be compromised. This practice guide explores a situation in which a care provider prescribes deploying an RPM device to the patient home. The RPM device captures biometric data on regular intervals, conveys the data to the clinical care team, and allows patient-clinician communication without the patient making an in-person visit to the HDO. RPM enables care based on the patient’s needs, regardless of geographic constraints. Capturing biometric data at regular intervals allows clinicians to have broader insight into a patient’s condition. With larger data sets, clinicians can monitor the patient’s condition and make diagnosis and treatment decisions with more robust information. RPM solutions allow audio and video communication in addition to utilizing biometric data, and they support the patient-clinician relationship. Implementing an RPM ecosystem involves multiple parties and environments. In developing the reference architecture for this practice guide, the NCCoE considered components that would be deployed in three distinct domains that encompass the RPM ecosystem: the patient home environment, the telehealth platform provider, and the HDO. The project team engaged with a telehealth platform provider that leveraged cloud services and facilitated audio- and videoconferencing between the patient home and the HDO. The telehealth platform provider provisioned and managed biometric devices that were deployed in the patient home, and routed data and communication between the patient home and the HDO. The NCCoE built a laboratory environment to simulate the telehealth ecosystem, performed a risk assessment, and developed an example implementation that demonstrates how HDOs can use standards-based, commercially available cybersecurity technologies and collaborate with telehealth platform providers to assure privacy and security biometric devices that are deployed to the patient home.

When HDOs deploy RPM solutions, those solutions implement architectures that distribute components across the HDO, telehealth platform providers, and patient homes. Each of these respective environments is managed by different groups of people, often with different sets of resources and technical capabilities. Risks are distributed across the solution architecture, and the methods by which one may mitigate those risks vary in complexity. While HDOs do not have the ability to manage and deploy privacy and cybersecurity controls unilaterally, they retain the responsibility to ensure that appropriate controls and risk mitigation are applied. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 2 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.This practice guide can help your organization:  Identify risks associated with the solution architecture  Apply the NIST Privacy Framework to broaden understanding of risk  Assure that HDOs partner with appropriate telehealth platform providers to extend privacy and cybersecurity control deployment, management, and efficacy  Consider future technologies that augment data communications safeguards 1.2 Solution Technology solutions alone may not be sufficient to maintain privacy and security controls on external environments. This practice guide notes the involvement of people, process, and technology as necessary to implement a holistic risk mitigation strategy. When developing this practice guide, the NCCoE team applied risk assessment approaches to determine where risks may occur and used assessment processes to identify applicable controls. The NCCoE collaborated with healthcare, technology, and telehealth partners to build a distributed RPM solution. The RPM solution implemented controls that safeguard the HDO environment and documented approaches that the telehealth platform provider addresses. Telehealth platform providers assure that RPM components are isolated within the patient home environment. The telehealth platform provider assures end-to-end data security between the patient and the HDO. 2 How to Use This Guide This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide demonstrates a standards-based reference design and provides users with the information they need to replicate an RPM environment. This reference design is modular and can be deployed in whole or in part. This guide contains three volumes:  NIST SP 1800-30A: Executive Summary  NIST SP 1800-30B: Approach, Architecture, and Security Characteristics–what we built and why (you are here)  NIST SP 1800-30C: How-To Guides–instructions for building the example solution Depending on your role in your organization, you might use this guide in different ways: Business decision makers, including chief security and technology officers, will be interested in the Executive Summary, NIST SP 1800-30A, which describes the following topics: NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 3 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30. challenges that enterprises face in securing the RPM ecosystem  example solution built at the NCCoE  benefits of adopting the example solution Technology or security program managers who are concerned with how to identify, understand, assess, and mitigate risk will be interested in this part of the guide, NIST SP 1800-30B, which describes what we did and why. The following sections will be of particular interest:  Section 3.4, Risk Assessment, provides a description of the risk analysis we performed  Section 3.5, Security Control Map, maps the security characteristics of this example solution to cybersecurity standards and best practices You might share the Executive Summary, NIST SP 1800-30A, with your leadership team members to help them understand the importance of adopting standards-based commercially available technologies that can help secure the RPM ecosystem. IT professionals who want to implement an approach like this will find the whole practice guide useful. You can use the how-to portion of the guide, NIST SP 1800-30C, to replicate all or parts of the build created in our lab. The how-to portion of the guide provides specific product installation, configuration, and integration instructions for implementing the example solution. We do not re-create the product manufacturers’ documentation, which is generally widely available. Rather, we show how we incorporated the products together in our environment to create an example solution. This guide assumes that IT professionals have experience implementing security products within the enterprise. While we have used a suite of commercial products to address this challenge, this guide does not endorse these particular products. Your organization can adopt this solution or one that adheres to these guidelines in whole, or you can use this guide as a starting point for tailoring and implementing parts of the NCCoE’s risk assessment and deployment of a defense-in-depth strategy in a distributed RPM solution. Your organization’s security experts should identify the products that will best integrate with your existing tools and IT system infrastructure. We hope that you will seek products that are congruent with applicable standards and best practices. Section 3.6, Technologies, lists the products we used and maps them to the cybersecurity controls provided by this reference solution. A NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide does not describe “the” solution but a possible solution. Comments, suggestions, and success stories will improve subsequent versions of this guide.

Patients may have chronic or recurring health conditions that require regular clinical monitoring; however, in-person visitation may be impractical or undesirable. Technology enables capturing biometric and patient-generated data, having those data relayed to systems that clinicians may use to evaluate a patient, and bidirectional communication of the data between the patient and clinician. RPM may be an appropriate means for performing healthcare in pandemic scenarios or to address patients who may live in parts of the country where healthcare settings or practitioners are scarce. The NCCoE collaborated with a healthcare Community of Interest (COI) that included technology and cybersecurity vendors, healthcare cybersecurity subject matter experts, and healthcare systems to identify RPM use cases, data workflows, ecosystem actor, and general deployment architecture. Further, with the assistance of the COI and external cybersecurity subject matter experts, a risk assessment was performed and reviewed, thereby confirming the measures and outcomes that were determined from the risk assessment activity. Additionally, this project reviewed NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations , as well as NIST SP 800-181 Rev. 1, Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) , for further guidance. These documents serve as NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 5 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.background for this project, with primary emphasis on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework , the NIST Risk Management Framework , and the NIST Privacy Framework . 3.1 Audience This guide is intended for professionals implementing an RPM ecosystem for HDOs that use third-party telehealth platform providers. This guide examines scenarios where HDOs partner with a third-party telehealth platform provider where that telehealth platform provider manages devices that are used by the patient in their home setting. The telehealth platform provider implements technology that collects and makes biometric data available to clinicians, thus allowing the HDO to focus on patient care delivery. Approaches and controls focus on securing end-to-end communications and safeguarding assets and data that reside at HDO facilities; and they also discuss measures that HDOs and telehealth platform providers should implement in the patient home. 3.2 Scope This RPM practice guide focuses on scenarios where patients with chronic or recurring conditions have biometric devices in their home that enable clinicians to regularly receive biometric data. The scope of this practice guide is limited to remote patient monitoring and does not include remote care. Patients and clinicians may use audio- and videoconferencing. The solution includes a third-party telehealth platform provider that provisions and manages biometric devices and provides means of communication. 3.3 Assumptions This practice guide makes the following assumptions:  RPM architecture includes deploying components to three distinct domains: the patient home, the telehealth platform provider, and the HDO.  HDOs are regulated entities and must comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations. In complying with laws and regulations, HDOs have implemented adequate privacy and security programs that include activities to address risk to both the organization and individuals when deploying an RPM architecture. Controls that have been implemented in accordance with laws and regulations provide an enterprise scope that this document refers to as pervasive controls.  The telehealth platform provider maintains an adequate privacy and security control environment.  The telehealth platform provider manages the configuration of patient home-deployed equipment.  The patient home may have different communications options such as cellular data connectivity or broadband internet. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 6 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30. RPM solutions emphasize collaboration. An RPM program’s efficacy depends on the patient, the telehealth platform provider, and the HDO to participate in the program and apply adequate privacy and security practices. The HDO does not define the control environments for the telehealth platform provider or the patient home. Each participant needs sufficient awareness and exercises appropriate control over components that operate in their domain.  Patient engagement activities provide the patient a clear understanding of privacy practices and expectations that address the specifics of the RPM architecture. For this practice guide, telehealth platform providers deployed biometric devices with cellular data capabilities. Additionally, this practice guide implemented a solution for biometric devices that used patient home Wi-Fi communications. 3.4 Risk Assessment NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, states that risk is “a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence”. The guide further defines risk assessment as “the process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the operation of an information system. Part of risk management incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses, and considers mitigations provided by security controls planned or in place”. The NCCoE recommends that any discussion of risk management, particularly at the enterprise level, begins with a comprehensive review of NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations. The Risk Management Framework (RMF) guidance, as a whole, proved to be invaluable in giving us a baseline to assess risks, from which we developed the project, the security characteristics of the build, and this guide. In this practice guide, the NCCoE implements multiple approaches in assessing risk. An RPM environment is composed of multiple domains, with different constituents managing each domain. When analyzing risk, this practice guide contextualizes that risk and selects mitigating controls by disrupting threats. A description of how this practice guide addresses these concepts is in Appendix C, Threats and Risks. The risk assessments included in Appendix C represent how the practice guide examines risks. Organizations may find that the threats, vulnerabilities, and risks that they observe may differ from this practice guide’s assessment. The risk assessments in this practice guide serve as examples that may catalyze how organizations perform their own risk assessments. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 7 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.3.4.1 Threats NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 defines a threat as “[a]ny circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or denial of service”. Threats are actions that may compromise a system’s confidentiality, integrity, or availability . Table 3-1 describes threats that have been evaluated for this project. Threats evolve, and an organization needs to perform its own analysis when evaluating threats and risks that the organization faces. Table 3-1 below is a sample threat taxonomy as it applies across the entire RPM ecosystem. The threat taxonomy uses: a confidentiality (C), integrity (I), and availability (A) categorization; the threat event considered; and a description of the threat event. While the threat taxonomy provides a landscape view of threats, organizations may want to perform threat modeling to determine contextual application of threats. Appendix C, Threats and Risks, describes concepts on how to examine contextualized threats. Table 3-1 Threat Taxonomy C, I, A Threat Event Description C phishing Phishing attacks are a form of social engineering, where the attacker presents themselves as a trusted party to gain the confidence of the victim. I, A malicious software Malicious software (malware) is unauthorized code that may be introduced to a system. It performs unintended actions that may disrupt normal system function. Malware may masquerade as desirable apps or applications. I, A command and control Command and control attacks may begin with deployment of malware. Malware may allow a system to be operated remotely by unauthorized entities. Should a system fall victim to a command-and-control attack, that system may then be used as a pivot point to attack other components, either within the organization’s infrastructure or as a point where attacks may be launched against other organizations. A ransomware Ransomware is a form of malware that disrupts access to system resources. A typical form of ransomware involves the malware employing encryption that disables a legitimate system user from accessing files. Ransomware attacks generally involve a demand for NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 8 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.C, I, A Threat Event Description payment to restore files.

Malware may be used for this purpose. A denial of service Flooding network connections with high-volume traffic attack to disrupt communication in patient home, between home and telehealth platform, or between telehealth platform provider and HDO. This type of attack could also be used to damage a device, e.g., through accelerated battery depletion. I transmitted data Unauthorized individuals may intercept and alter data manipulation transmissions. 3.4.2 Vulnerabilities This practice guide uses a customized application for identifying vulnerabilities, which aggregates vulnerabilities identified in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1. As noted in this special publication, a vulnerability is a deficiency or weakness that a threat source may exploit, resulting in a threat event. The document further describes how vulnerabilities may exist in a broader context, i.e., that they may be found in organizational governance structures, external relationships, and mission/business processes. The table in Section C-6 of Appendix C, Threats and Risks, enumerates those vulnerabilities by using a holistic approach and represents those vulnerabilities that this project identified and for which it offers guidance. 3.4.3 Problematic Data Actions for Privacy This build considered operational activities of the example solution that interact with patient data during RPM processes (“data actions”) and identified those that potentially cause problems to individuals. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 9 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.The NIST Privacy Framework defines a problematic data action as “a data action that could cause an adverse effect for individuals” . Problematic data actions can result in privacy risk to individuals and prevent an organization from developing a solution that meets the privacy engineering objectives of:  predictability: enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about data and their processing by a system, product, or service  manageability: providing the capability for granular administration of data, including alteration, deletion, and selective disclosure  disassociability: enabling the processing of data or events without association to individuals or devices beyond the operational requirements of the system Table 3-2 below demonstrates the problematic data action taxonomy identified for the entire RPM ecosystem. This Problematic Data Action Taxonomy uses: a predictability (P), manageability (M), and disassociability (D) designation; the problematic data action considered; and the description of the problematic data action. While the Problematic Data Action Taxonomy provides a landscape view of problematic data action, an organization may want to perform a risk assessment to determine contextual application of the problematic data action. The discussion about problematic data actions and risks in Appendix D introduces the PRAM  and provides a more detailed analysis. Table 3-2 Problematic Data Action Taxonomy P, M, D Problematic Data Description Action P, M distortion Inaccurate or misleadingly incomplete data are used or disseminated. Distortion can present users in an inaccurate, unflattering, or disparaging manner, opening the door for stigmatization, discrimination, or loss of liberty. M insecurity Lapses in data security can result in various problems, including loss of trust, exposure to economic loss and other identity theft-related harms, and dignity losses. D, M re-identification De-identified data, or data otherwise disassociated from specific individuals, become identifiable or associated with specific individuals again. It can lead to problems such as discrimination, loss of trust, and dignity losses. P, M unanticipated Data reveal or expose an individual or facets of an revelation individual in unexpected ways. Unanticipated revelation can arise from aggregation and analysis of NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 10 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.P, M, D Problematic Data Description Action large and/or diverse data sets. Unanticipated revelation can give rise to dignity losses, discrimination, and loss of trust and autonomy. The project team used the NIST PRAM  and accompanying Catalog of Problematic Data Actions and Problems  to conduct this analysis. Table 3-2, Problematic Data Action Taxonomy, provides the results of this analysis. See Appendix D for additional considerations regarding examples of problematic data actions for RPM solutions. 3.4.4 Risk As noted in Section 3.4, NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, defines risk as “a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by potential circumstance or event, and is typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence” . Risk is the adverse impact; that is, risk is the result when a threat (attack) successfully leverages one or more vulnerabilities. As organizations consider risk, they should note that risk is not discrete; that is, one may realize multiple risks based on a successful attack. Notwithstanding, we consider those risks identified below. In reviewing these risks, please note that we consider unique scenarios that presume certain attack types for the two risks categorized as availability risks, those being ransomware and pivot point attacks. Table 3-3, Cybersecurity Risk Taxonomy, describes high-level cybersecurity risks that affect the RPM environment. The risk taxonomy table captures key risks, assigning where the risk may impact the organization across a confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)  dimension.

Table 3-4, Privacy Risk Taxonomy, describes high-level privacy risks that affect the RPM environment. Table 3-4 captures key risks, assigning where the risk may impact individuals, in the areas of predictability, manageability, and disassociability . Privacy risk levels to individuals depend on the context of specific RPM solution deployment and are not included. These risks are discussed further in Appendix D.

NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 13 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.3.4.5 Mitigating Risk As noted above, risk is the adverse outcome when a threat successfully leverages a vulnerability. Mitigating risk may take many different forms. This practice guide addresses risk by performing a threat modeling exercise and by mitigating threats. The previous sections discussed threat from a holistic perspective. That is, the noted threats enumerate a broad survey of attack types that may adversely affect the RPM ecosystem. RPM decomposes to the following three distinct domains: patient home, telehealth platform provider, and HDO. As organizations consider measures to disrupt threats and adverse actions made against the ecosystem, an opportunity exists where organizations examine threats to identify controls that mitigate adverse actions identified by threat modeling. 3.5 Security Control Map As this practice guide considered RPM ecosystem risks, the team performed a mapping to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework . This mapping established an initial set of appropriate control Functions, Categories, and Subcategories. The mapping demonstrated how selected Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories map to controls in NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5  as well as to the Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework), NIST SP 800-181 . The table also lists sector-specific standards and best practices (e.g., the International Electrotechnical Commission [IEC] Technical Reports [TR], International Organization for Standardization [ISO]) as well as from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) , , ). The security control map, shown in Table 3-5, identifies a set of controls, including those specifically implemented in the lab build, as well as the pervasive set of controls as described in Section 5.2, Pervasive Controls, that HDOs should deploy. Practitioners should refer to Appendix C of NIST SP 1800-24, Securing Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) for further description of pervasive controls .

Refer to Table 3-5 for an explanation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Subcategory codes and Table 3-6 for an explanation of the NIST Privacy Framework Subcategory codes. While this practice guide notes that the RPM solution is deployed across three domains, HDOs must recognize that the responsibility for risk management remains with the HDO. Risk mitigation may be achieved through tools or practices, where privacy and security measures are applied as appropriate in each of the domains. HDOs may find that deploying privacy and security tools to the patient home involves challenges, and that, therefore an HDO may collaborate with the telehealth platform provider NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 33 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.to provide adequate education and awareness training to patients. Training may address appropriate use of the equipment that is sent to the patient home, awareness that patient data are involved, and that the patient needs to assure that data are shared only with authorized individuals. For this practice guide, the telehealth platform provider is a third-party entity distinct from the patient and the HDO. Telehealth platform providers should implement an adequate control environment that enables the telehealth platform provider to collaborate with HDOs in delivering RPM solutions. The scope of this practice guide does not discuss all controls that a telehealth platform provider should deploy. Rather, this practice guide focuses on controls that are deployed in the HDO. The telehealth platform provider is a separate entity and should ensure that adequate controls are implemented in its environment. Further, telehealth platform providers must ensure that equipment deployed to the patient home includes appropriate safeguards.

CT.DM-P8 4 Architecture This practice guide implements a representative RPM solution as a distributed architecture. The solution deployed components across three domains that consist of the patient home, the telehealth platform provider, and the HDO. The patient home is the environment in which the patient lives and uses RPM components that include biometric monitoring devices, devices that the patient uses to communicate with their care team, and devices that the patient operates for personal use. This practice guide incorporates cloud-hosted telehealth platform providers within the architecture. The telehealth NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 38 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.platform provider maintains components that include virtual or physical components with servers to manage, maintain, and receive data communications from either the patient home or the HDO. The HDO maintains its own environment and includes components such as workstations and clinical systems to receive and interpret patient data and record patient interactions in an electronic health record (EHR) system. Figure 4-1 illustrates a high-level RPM distributed architecture. The depicted architecture notes two primary paths by which network communications traverse. Path 1 shows biometric devices communicating with the telehealth platform provider whereas Path 2 shows the use of a mobile app. The mobile app operates on an interface device (i.e., a provisioned tablet). For Path 2, patients use the tablet to collect data from the biometric devices. Path 2 does not involve data transfer between the biometric device to the telehealth platform provider directly. Rather, patients collect biometric data with the tablet. Patients use the tablet for communications with data exchanges between the patient home and the telehealth platform provider. Figure 4-1 RPM Architecture NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 39 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.4.1 Layering the Architecture The NCCoE healthcare lab stratified the distributed architecture with three layers: business, security, and infrastructure. The business layer focuses on functional capabilities that include biometric readings and patient interactions. The security layer conceptually describes how the NCCoE lab implements security capabilities. The NCCoE also implements an infrastructure layer that represents the network and communications environment. The layers intersect each of the three domains. The patient home domain implements the business layer by using the biometric devices and interface device(s) that capture and relay biometric data from the patient and allow the patient to communicate with the clinical care team, respectively. The patient home may include a security layer component that segregates network traffic between the RPM components and personally-owned devices when the RPM devices use the same network infrastructure (e.g., over Wi-Fi) as the personally-owned devices. When devices operate and communicate over Wi-Fi, the infrastructure layer would consist of Wi-Fi access points, routers, and switches that the patient operates. The telehealth platform provider domain also implements three layers. The business layer consists of services that facilitate handling patient data and web- or audioconferencing capabilities. The security layer consists of components used to secure the environment, such as authentication mechanisms, certificate management systems, and security logging capabilities. The infrastructure layer consists of network and server components that may be implemented as cloud services. Practitioners should note that this practice guide does not go into significant detail regarding security or infrastructure layer configurations for telehealth platform providers. As noted in this practice guide’s list of assumptions, it is assumed that telehealth platform providers have adequate privacy and security controls. These controls would align with the layer concept. HDOs should evaluate telehealth platform providers to determine control adequacy. The HDO domain implements the business layer with applications and clinical systems used to support the RPM program. The security layer represents security capability deployment, which includes authentication mechanisms, network monitoring capabilities, and vulnerability scanning for example. The HDO implements the infrastructure layer with fundamental IT services such as Active Directory (AD), DNS, and networking devices. Figure 4-2 depicts a high-level view of the three layers intersecting each domain of these components and how we approached implementing them in the lab environment. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 40 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.Figure 4-2 Architecture Layers 4.2 High-Level Architecture Communications Pathways This practice guide describes an architecture that considers six different communications paths among the patient home, telehealth platform provider, and HDO. Figure 4-3, RPM Communications Paths, shows the different paths labeled A through F. The different communications paths represent the varying modes by which the patient shares data with the clinician. Each path leads to the telehealth platform provider who receives the data and presents the data in an HDO-facing application. The clinician accesses data presented within an HDO-facing application via an app or application. 4.2.1 Cellular Data Pathways The following communications pathways describe how patients use devices that are preconfigured with cellular data services. Telehealth platform providers may provision devices with cellular data capability to support ease of use and connectivity assurance and to ensure that the device may not be reachable by an untrusted internet connection (e.g., an arbitrary Wi-Fi hot spot). Path A assumes that the biometric device has cellular communications. The telehealth platform provider deploys the biometric device with a preconfigured subscriber identity module, commonly referred to as a subscriber identity module (SIM) card. Option A does not include an RPM interface, such as a mobile NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 41 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.device that may be a laptop, cellular phone, or tablet. The biometric device sends data over cellular data networks, which then route the data to the telehealth platform provider. The telehealth platform provider receives the data and displays it for clinicians to view through a portal or dashboard application. The clinician accesses the data through a clinician-facing app or application. Path B assumes that the telehealth platform provider has deployed a biometric device and an RPM interface to the patient home. The RPM interface may be a mobile device such as a cellular phone or tablet. For this path, the biometric device forwards data to the RPM interface via Bluetooth. The RPM interface would include a SIM card that enables cellular data communication to the telehealth platform provider. The RPM interface would be deployed with an app to be used by the patient. The app would include an interface that allows the patient to forward the data to the telehealth platform provider. 4.2.2 Broadband Pathways Telehealth platform providers may provide devices that leverage broadband internet connectivity provisioned at the patient home. Devices may use Wi-Fi or other communications protocols. Devices may transmit data that traverse a patient-provided internet router. The following pathways describe how data may flow when internet broadband is available. Path C assumes that the telehealth platform provider has deployed a biometric device and an RPM interface to the patient home. The dataflow within the patient home domain is the same as Path B. However, rather than cellular communication, the RPM interface communicates with the telehealth platform provider via a broadband connection provided by the patient. Path D has the same dataflow as Path C; however, external network transmissions traverse an add-on security device such as a Layer 2 over Layer 3 gateway. Path E is like Path A; however, rather than cellular data, the path leverages a patient home broadband connection traversing an add-on security device such as a Layer 2 over Layer 3 gateway. Path F is like Paths A and E. Path F leverages a patient home broadband connection; however, no other gateway is used. Data are sent directly to the telehealth platform provider over the public internet. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 42 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.Figure 4-3 RPM Communications Paths 4.3 Data and Process Flows To gain a high-level understanding of how RPM programs operate, this practice guide evaluates two use cases: diabetes and cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation. The World Health Organization defines diabetes as “a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves” . A diabetes RPM program could be beneficial in identifying when a patient’s blood glucose levels are higher/lower than normal. Ensuring that a patient’s blood glucose levels remain in a normal range helps prevent long-term complications that diabetes could cause . Patients may receive biometric devices such as glucometers, blood pressure monitors, weight scales, and activity trackers. These biometric devices may be enabled with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular data communications capabilities that allow patients to share biometric data with physicians. Physicians may continuously monitor patients’ biometric data to identify and prevent a potential problem from occurring. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 43 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.HDOs may enroll patients with chronic heart or lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or coronary heart disease into cardiac and pulmonary RPM rehabilitation programs. These programs help patients return to a normal life and reduce other risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and stress , . Telehealth platform providers implement solutions by using biometric devices, services, and applications. While telehealth platform providers may develop and maintain services and applications, they collaborate with manufacturers to procure and manage biometric devices. Conceptually, the device manufacturer operates as an extension of the telehealth platform provider when delivering RPM solutions to patients. As noted in Section 4.2, High-Level Architecture Communications Pathways, practitioners may implement RPM ecosystems where data communications involve different communications protocols or paths. This practice guide examines two distinct dataflows. The first dataflow begins when the patient transmits data from the biometric device. The biometric device sends data to the device manufacturer. The telehealth platform provider retrieves the data and presents the data through an HDO-facing application. The clinician views the data from an app or application that interfaces with the patient data residing in the telehealth platform provider HDO-facing application. The second dataflow begins when the patient transmits the data from the biometric device. A field gateway device, such as a mobile device that may be a tablet, mobile phone, or laptop, pulls the data from the biometric device. The patient uses the field gateway device to transport the data to the telehealth platform provider. The telehealth platform provider receives the data and presents it through an HDO-facing application. The clinician views the data from an app or application that interfaces with the patient data residing in the telehealth platform provider HDO-facing application. Figure 4-4 depicts the first dataflow sequence. This dataflow sequence demonstrates an RPM implementation that uses device vendor platforms to transmit data from a patient’s home to the telehealth platform provider. A patient begins the process by interfacing with the biometric device provided by the third-party platform, which in turn gathers the required medical readings. Once the device gathers the desired readings, the device transmits and stores the data to the device vendor’s local storage server. The third-party platform connects to the vendor’s storage server and pulls that data into its own local storage server. The platform then evaluates the received data and creates correlations among the retrieved data, the associated patient, and the primary care provider. If the platform identifies any areas of concern (such as high blood glucose readings for a diabetes use case) while evaluating the data, the platform sends an alert to the patient’s primary care provider for immediate action. Otherwise, the primary care provider will connect to the third-party platform’s web server to view the patient’s data on a dashboard. The physician/clinician will evaluate the data, modify the patient’s care plan, update the patient’s EHR, and contact the patient via video or audio call to update them on their new care plan. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 44 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.Figure 4-4 RPM Dataflow Option 1 Figure 4-5 depicts the second dataflow sequence. In this dataflow sequence, a patient begins the process by interfacing with the biometric device provided by the telehealth platform provider, which in turn collects the required medical readings. Once the data are collected, the device transmits the data to the mobile device. The patient interacts with the mobile device to answer survey questions associated with their program, providing a clinician more insight on the patient’s health. The patient uses the mobile device to collect data from all biometric devices associated with their RPM regimen. The patient then uses the mobile device to transmit the biometric device data and survey results. The mobile device pushes the grouped data to the telehealth platform provider. The telehealth platform provider presents the data to the primary care provider. The clinician connects to the telehealth platform provider’s web server to view the patient’s data on a dashboard. The clinician evaluates the data and may update the patient’s care plan. Then, the clinician may update the patient’s EHR and contact the patient via a mobile device to update them on their new care plan.

When building the HDO environment, the team built upon the zoned network architecture described in NIST SP 1800-8, Securing Wireless Infusion Pumps in Healthcare Delivery Organizations . The team used the network zoning approach as a baseline for the RPM ecosystem infrastructure. On top of the baseline, the team selected relevant security capabilities for appropriate domains. The selected security capabilities are:  telehealth platform provider  risk assessment controls  identity management, authentication, and access control  data security  anomalies and events and security continuous monitoring NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 46 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.HDOs bear risk when implementing RPM practices. The RPM environment is distributed across three domains and requires participation of the patient, the telehealth platform provider, and the HDO to assure that risks are adequately mitigated. This practice guide’s architecture describes deploying components in three domains, with threats and risks that may affect each domain distinctly. As organizations implement RPM solutions, they must include parties involved in managing the individual domains in recognizing and safeguarding against privacy and cybersecurity events that may occur within the respective domains. Practitioners will note that the security capability descriptions focus primarily on the HDO domain. Capabilities are deployed to other domains to the extent that the HDO may have influence. HDOs may not authoritatively determine the control environment implemented by the telehealth platform provider. HDOs may obtain assurance that similar controls are implemented by the telehealth platform provider before establishing the relationship with the provider. HDOs should establish questionnaires or audit approaches that they may use in evaluating third parties such as telehealth platform providers. HDOs and telehealth platform providers are subject to regulatory requirements to ensure patient privacy and cybersecurity. Telehealth platform providers are third parties that may implement security capabilities that do not necessarily use the tools standard to the HDO. Telehealth platform providers may provide services for many HDOs, and implementing the same tools for all HDOs may not be feasible from a technical perspective. Telehealth platform providers apply risk management approaches that are appropriate for their business model. While telehealth platform providers may manage risk by using different tools and techniques from the HDO, these providers should address the risk concerns for the HDO. Telehealth platform providers should apply similar measures, e.g., the NIST Cybersecurity Framework  and Risk Management Framework , that describe risk and control approaches. When evaluating telehealth platform providers, HDOs should review the privacy and security control policies and other documentation to ensure that the mitigation approaches that the telehealth platform provider implements are consistent with the HDO’s requirements. HDOs and telehealth platform providers may find difficulties when implementing security capabilities on the patient home domain. Patients may find complex controls or practices onerous, and, therefore, they may be less likely to participate in the RPM program. Telehealth platform providers may implement security capabilities for end-point devices, such as biometric sensors or mobile devices, that are part of the RPM program. HDOs, in collaboration with telehealth platform providers, may offer education and awareness material to discuss appropriate use of RPM-deployed equipment with the patient. 4.4.1 Telehealth Platform Provider Telehealth platform providers are discussed in this practice guide as a security capability. HDOs implementing RPM programs will depend on telehealth platform providers to enable communications between patients and clinicians. Also, for this practice guide, telehealth platform providers configure, NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 47 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.manage, and maintain biometric devices and potentially other technology provided to the patient. HDOs engaging with telehealth platform providers to enable their RPM programs are responsible for ensuring that they apply due diligence and understand the privacy and security capabilities that the telehealth platform provider maintains. HDOs and partners with whom HDOs engage may be responsible for adhering to regulatory compliance and should ensure that HDOs have implemented measures that address compliance concerns as a baseline. Telehealth platform providers represent a third-party partner, and HDOs should evaluate their partners accordingly. In addition to safeguarding systems that aggregate patient information, telehealth platform providers are responsible for assuring that the biometric devices that are deployed to the patient home include adequate controls that mitigate privacy and security risk. Biometric devices have characteristics that are similar to Internet of Things (IoT) architecture. Telehealth platform providers should consider clinical efficacy of the devices as well as assure that devices do not pose privacy or cybersecurity harm to the patient home or the broader RPM ecosystem. Appendix E, Benefits of Device Cybersecurity Requirements, discusses challenges that may be found in biometric devices that may be regarded as IoT. Appendix Eʼs roots are founded in a new set of guidance focused on IoT security. NIST is developing several documents that discuss how IoT device manufacturers may incorporate privacy and security measures in products. Telehealth platform providers may review IoT Device Cybersecurity Guidance for the Federal Government: Establishing IoT Device Cybersecurity Requirements (NIST SP 800-213) . While NIST SP 800-213 focuses on the federal government’s IoT deployment efforts, concepts found in the document may inform telehealth platform providers as they evolve their biometric device acquisition processes. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework includes risk assessment under the Identify Function. This practice guide implements tools for vulnerability management. The practice guide uses Tenable.sc with Nessus to perform vulnerability scanning and provide dashboard reports. Vulnerability scanning operates by applying signatures of known vulnerabilities. Components that operate within the HDO domain are subject to regular vulnerability scanning. As vulnerabilities are identified, patching or other mitigating approaches may be applied. Patches or updates to operating systems, apps, or applications may be applied as available. 4.4.2 Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control Identity management involves activities that discuss identity proofing and establishing credentials. Authentication for this practice guide provides the mechanisms that assure that authorized entities access the system after telehealth platform providers and HDOs establish respective credentials. Practitioners should refer to NIST SP 1800-24 (reference Section 5.3.3), Securing Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) , which provides more in-depth discussion on identity management and access control. While that practice guide uses different tools and addresses a clinical practice NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 48 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.different from RPM, concepts regarding identity management and authentication are relevant for this practice guide. This practice guide builds upon a network zoning concept that was discussed in NIST SP 1800-8, Securing Wireless Infusion Pumps in Healthcare Delivery Organizations . Figure 4-6 depicts the lab environment built for this practice guide. The diagram splits the infrastructure between the NCCoE and the RPM lab, with the latter representing the configured simulated environments for this practice guide. Focusing on the HDO cloud depiction, this practice guide simulates the HDO environment that is made up of enterprise services, health information system (HIS) services, remote services, databases, clinical workstations, and security services virtual local area networks (VLANs). Figure 4-6 Network Segmentation and VLAN Within the RPM Lab The practice guide extends the network zoning concept between the patient home and the telehealth platform provider. Biometric devices in the patient home using a Wi-Fi communications pathway that traverses a patient-provided broadband connection are secured using a layer 2 over layer 3 solution. In a simulated cloud environment, engineers deployed the layer 2 over layer 3 solution between zones that represent the patient home and a telehealth platform provider. The layer 2 over layer 3 solution segmented the biometric devices from the patient home network into a secured enclave. The enclave assures that network traffic from the patient home is not introduced or have visibility to the biometric devices. The layer 2 over layer 3 solution secures the data-in-transit communications between the NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 49 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.patient home and telehealth platform provider domains respectively and adopts an approach that is consistent with concepts described in NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture . 4.4.3 Data Security This practice guide examines challenges associated with data loss and data alteration. Communications initiate from the patient home, traversing a public communications channel, and are made accessible to clinicians via internet connectivity. This practice guide addresses the need to provide end-to-end data protection as a vital requirement to ensure RPM viability. Network sessions are encrypted. Telehealth platform providers implement data security as they manage biometric devices and the dataflow between the patient home and solutions hosted by the telehealth platform provider. Stored data are protected through encryption. The project team examined dataflows and applied a privacy risk assessment that analyzed communications between the implemented components and identified how data-in-transit security controls are implemented. 4.4.4 Anomalies and Events and Security Continuous Monitoring Managing anomalies and events and performing security continuous monitoring provides a proactive, real-time measure to determine that threats and vulnerabilities are appropriately recognized and mitigated within HDO environments. This practice guide implements several controls that address managing anomalies and events and performing security continuous monitoring. Security engineers require tools and processes to manage anomalies and events that include applying cyber threat intelligence (CTI), collecting and managing log information, and applying behavioral analytics. NIST describes CTI in NIST SP 800-150, Guide to Cyber Threat Information Sharing . NIST provides additional detail regarding security continuous monitoring in NIST SP 800-137 . 4.5 Final Architecture The project team built a reference architecture to include two communications pathways for biometric devices. In the first case, biometric devices in the patient home communicated to the telehealth platform provider over cellular data communications. The team built an architecture that addressed communications pathways A and B that were described in Section 4.2, High-Level Architecture Communications Pathways. In the second case, biometric devices communicated to a mobile device, and the mobile device leveraged the patient home Wi-Fi infrastructure. Mobile device communications to the telehealth platform provider are secured by a layer 2 over layer 3 solution through Onclave’s Secure IoT platform. Layer 2 over Layer 3 concepts are further described in Appendix F. This scenario aligns with pathway D described in Section 4.2. Figure 4-7 depicts the final architecture of the lab environment. The two telehealth platform providers, Accuhealth and Vivify, provided cloud-hosted solutions, with biometric devices deployed in respective home environments, described as Home One and Home Two. Biometric devices were provisioned and NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 50 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.managed by the telehealth platform providers, with data communications over cellular data. A Home Three environment was provisioned to deploy biometric devices that would communicate over Wi-Fi. The architecture includes a telehealth platform provider hosted in a simulated cloud environment. Engineers implemented a layer 2 over layer 3 solution between Home 3 and the simulated cloud environment. The architecture also includes an HDO environment with six network zones: Remote Services, Clinical Workstations, Enterprise Services, Databases, HIS Services, and Security Services. Figure 4-7 Final Architecture 5 Security and Privacy Characteristic Analysis The purpose of the security and privacy characteristic analysis is to understand the extent to which the project meets its objective of demonstrating the privacy and security capabilities described in the reference architecture in Section 4. In addition, it seeks to understand the security and privacy benefits and drawbacks of the example solution. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 51 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.5.1 Assumptions and Limitations The security characteristic analysis has the following limitations:  It is neither a comprehensive test of all security components nor a red-team exercise.  It cannot identify all weaknesses.  It does not include the lab infrastructure. It is assumed that devices are hardened. Testing these devices would reveal only weaknesses in implementation that would not be relevant to those adopting this reference architecture.  HDOs and telehealth platform providers implement an array of risk mitigation approaches that extend beyond what is discussed in this document. The broader array of controls consists of organizational structures, policies and procedures, and tools to support enterprise privacy and cybersecurity programs that this practice guide refers to as a set of pervasive controls.  HDOs and telehealth platform providers evaluate privacy risks throughout the RPM solution ecosystem and coordinate risk management roles and expectations with organizations that are part of the RPM solution. 5.2 Pervasive Controls NIST SP 1800-24, Securing Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) , described the use of controls that were termed “pervasive”. Subsequent practice guides such as this RPM practice guide discuss implementing controls that narrowly apply to the practice guide’s lab construction. Notwithstanding, HDOs and telehealth platform providers are enterprise organizations that may face a broader set of risks, including regulatory requirements, that extend beyond the narrow topic. The pervasive control concept assumes that HDOs and telehealth platform providers have implemented a comprehensive control set to address their risk and regulatory obligation. For example, onboarding workforce members may involve identity proofing and creating and managing accounts and credentials. Organizations need to perform these activities to appropriately implement an enterprise risk management program. The requirement is not specific to RPM programs. These functions should be established prior to implementing an RPM program. Other controls, such as performing asset management, having incident response teams, and establishing incident response programs, should also be pervasive across the enterprise. Another example is asset management. Asset management is a critical control that should be implemented by telehealth platform providers. Telehealth platform providers should maintain accurate inventories and manage configuration settings, patching, updates, and the overall life cycle for devices that are deployed to the patient home. While this is a requirement, the project team partnered with multiple telehealth platform providers. The team did not deploy security or privacy capabilities to the telehealth platform providers. Rather, it relied upon telehealth platform providers to implement an NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 52 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.adequate and appropriate set of pervasive controls for their environment and for the services that they provide. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework  describes cybersecurity activities and outcomes that organizations should achieve for establishing or improving enterprise security programs. These activities and outcomes are articulated in the Subcategories of the Cybersecurity Framework Core. The Cybersecurity Framework provides the basis for pervasive controls, whereas this practice guide highlights implementation of selected controls. Readers should not regard the selected controls as the only controls that an HDO must implement. The selected controls that are described in this practice guide are a small subset of controls that HDOs and telehealth platform providers should implement. This practice guide’s descriptions of controls indicate how the selected controls were implemented in the lab environment. 5.3 Telehealth Platform Providers Telehealth platform providers address several controls for the RPM solution. Telehealth platform providers configure, maintain, and manage devices that are deployed to the patient home domain. Telehealth platform providers provision devices to patients who have been enrolled in an RPM program by their HDO. Telehealth platform providers perform asset management for the provisioned devices and, thus, address ID.AM-1, ID.AM-2, ID.AM-4, ID.AM-5, ID.IM-P1, ID.IM-P2, and ID.IM-P7. Telehealth platform providers are responsible for addressing ID.RA-1. Telehealth platform providers authenticate sessions based on the device identifier. When patients send or transfer data from biometric devices, data are routed to the telehealth platform provider. The telehealth platform provider receives the data and makes it available to clinicians and system users via a portal. Portals use unique identifiers for credentials (e.g., username/password) and role-based access control and ensure that connections to the portal are protected by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. For this practice guide, telehealth platform providers provisioned two classes of biometric devices: those that used cellular data communications and those that used the patient home-provided Wi-Fi network. In the first category, devices were explicitly not permitted to access Wi-Fi networks. Removing Wi-Fi capability separated RPM communication from network traffic that may have been present in the patient home domain. In the second case that deployed biometric devices that included Wi-Fi capability, those devices leveraged the patient home Wi-Fi environment and used a layer 2 over layer 3 solution to secure connectivity between the RPM devices and the telehealth platform provider. For biometric devices that focused on cellular data communications, the project team used devices that were equipped to communicate over 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE), which uses asymmetric encryption between the device and the cellular tower . Further investigation in data-in-transit protection was not determined in this practice guide. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 53 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.The second case included biometric devices leveraged in the patient home Wi-Fi environment. Network sessions were secured using another product that provided in-transit protection using a layer 2 over layer 3 solution. The project team deployed dedicated gateway devices used to implement a network infrastructure that was consistent with NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture . The telehealth platform provider addressed PR.AC-1, PR.AC-4, PR.DS-1, PR.DS-2, PR.DS-4, PR.DS-6, PR.PT-1, PR.PT-3, PR.PT-4, PR.AC-P1, PR.AC-P4, PR.DS-P1, PR.DS-P2, PR.DS-P4, PR.DS-P6, CT.DM-P8, PR.PT-P2, and PR.PT-P3. The project team implemented telehealth platform provider services with Accuhealth and Vivify Health. 5.4 Risk Assessment (ID.RA and ID.RA-P) This practice guide implemented tools that address elements of ID.RA-5 (threats, vulnerabilities, likelihoods, and impacts are used to determine risk) and ID.RA-P4. The project team implemented Tenable.sc to address vulnerability management. Tenable includes vulnerability scanning and dashboards that display identified vulnerabilities with scoring and other metrics that enable security engineers to prioritize. Telehealth platform providers have separate infrastructures and organizational structures that require similar approaches. Telehealth platform providers may host their services with various implementations and may deploy similar solutions for their environments. 5.5 Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AC and PR.AC-P) Protective Technology (PR.PT-P) The engineers regarded many of the identity management Subcategories as part of a set of pervasive controls that have been discussed in NIST SP 1800-24, Securing Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) . HDOs and telehealth platform providers should apply similar solutions to address managing human, device, and system identities. Sample solutions are provided in NIST SP 1800-24. Extending the network zoning concepts that were described in NIST SP 1800-8, Securing Wireless Infusion Pumps in Healthcare Delivery Organizations , the project team implemented VLANs with firewall feature sets by using Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD). This practice guide addresses PR.AC- 5 by implementing VLANs that represent network zones found within an HDO. Telehealth platform providers may implement similar measures within their infrastructures. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework implements identity management, authentication, and access control under the Protect Function by using the PR.AC Category. Within the HDO, the engineers implemented PR.AC-5 by using Cisco FTD to establish network zones as a set of VLANs. The network zones assure that components from each zone do not have implicit trust, and, thus, compromises on end points found in one zone are limited in their ability to affect devices that operate in other zones. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 54 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.The Onclave Secure IoT platform creates unique enclaves within the patient home and the telehealth platform provider with their own root of trust for implicit trust. The engineers implemented three primary Cisco tools for the HDO environment: Cisco Firepower, Cisco Umbrella, and Cisco Stealthwatch. As noted, the project team used Firepower to create and manage VLANs within the environment. Cisco Firepower includes a central management dashboard that allowed security engineers to configure and manage other features within the Cisco suite of tools. Firepower also includes intrusion detection capability and visibility into network traffic and network analytics that enabled engineers to detect and analyze events, monitor the network, and detect malicious code and, thus, addressed DE.AE-2, DE.CM-1, and DE.CM-4. Cisco Firepower addressed PR.AC-5, PR.PT-4, PR.AC- P5, and PR.PT-P3. The engineers implemented Cisco Umbrella for DNS and IP layer security and provided content and application filtering. Cisco Umbrella addressed DE.CM-4. The team also used Cisco Stealthwatch that implemented behavioral analytics capabilities and provided malware detection. Cisco Stealthwatch addressed PR.DS-5, PR.PT-4, DE.AE-1, DE.CM-1, PR.DS-P5, and PR.PT-P3. Within the HDO domain, engineers implemented an AD to establish user accounts. AD credentials provided engineers with authentication for several components deployed in the lab. The lab’s AD implementation addresses PR.AC-1, PR.AC-4, PR.AC-P1, and PR.AC-P4. The telehealth platform provider assures that PR.AC-5, PR.AC-6, PR.AC-7, PR.AC-P5, and PR.AC-P6 are met by managing components that are deployed to the patient home. Components that are deployed by the telehealth platform provider are fully managed devices that have been preconfigured and distributed by Accuhealth. The RPM components that Accuhealth provided for the patient home use a cellular communication pathway where unauthorized individuals may not remove or alter SIM cards. The cellular data communication pathway assures that the RPM components are segregated from untrusted devices that may operate in the patient home and, thus, implements PR.AC-5 and PR.AC-P5. This practice guide also simulated a use case where a telehealth platform provider provides RPM components that use patient-provided broadband. The simulated test case implements Vivify components; however, it does not reflect how Vivify hosts its services. Biometric devices communicate with an interface device (e.g., the tablet). The simulated environment includes centralized configuration management for interface devices such as the tablet. Management prevents end users from modifying tablet configuration settings or installing unauthorized software. In this use case, biometric devices leverage the patient home Wi-Fi. Engineers secured the devices by leveraging a layer 2 over layer 3 solution to create a secure enclave. The solution segments the biometric devices from the patient home network, with only the biometric devices enabled to communicate over the secure enclave. The secure enclave solution included gateways implemented at the patient home and the simulated telehealth provider. The secure enclave solution supports PR.AC-1, PR.AC-3, PR.AC-4, PR.AC-5, and PR.PT-4. RPM-enrolled patients are predetermined by the HDO, and the telehealth platform provider provisions RPM components to an established, known set of patients. HDOs enrolling patients in the RPM program partially addresses PR.AC-1 and PR.AC-P1. Clinicians identifying patients may be regarded as performing NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 55 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.an identity-proofing activity, whereas telehealth platform providers may complete PR.AC-1 and PR.AC- P1 activities by creating accounts or records that relate to the patient and the RPM equipment that the patient receives. Patient-provided (e.g., “bring your own device”) biometric devices were excluded in this practice guide’s architecture. The telehealth platform provider manages patient home-deployed components and, thus, assures that PR.AC-6 and PR.AC-P6 are addressed. For this practice guide, the telehealth platform provider manages components that it procured and configured. The telehealth platform provider configures the devices to include authenticators that enforce component authentication. For this practice guide, only biometric devices that are managed by telehealth platform providers are provisioned authenticators. This implements PR.AC-7 and PR.AC-P6. Patient homes may include other devices, such as personally-owned devices, that are not a part of the RPM ecosystem. Devices that are not managed by telehealth platform providers do not have authentication credentials for the RPM solution. One should note that this practice guide simulated a telehealth platform provider when exploring biometric devices that communicate over broadband. 5.6 Data Security (PR.DS and PR.DS-P) This practice guide implemented PR.DS-2 and PR.DS-P2 to ensure that data-in-transit are protected. HDOs connecting to cloud-hosted consoles used TLS 1.2 . The telehealth platform provider assured implementation of PR.DS-3 and PR.DS-P3 for RPM biometric devices deployed to the patient home. For biometric devices that communicate over broadband, the project team secured network sessions using a layer 2 over layer 3 solution that is established using the Onclave Secure IoT platform. The solution segmented biometric devices and their communication from the patient home network. Network sessions between the patient home and the simulated telehealth platform provider used TLS 1.2. The Onclave Secure IoT platform used a key management mechanism that is consistent with guidance from NIST SP 800-57 Part 1, Revision 5, Recommendation for Key Management: Part 1–General . The Onclave IoT Platform solution secured sessions using a private blockchain. Data-in-transit used Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-256 encryption . This addresses PR-DS-2 and PR-DS.5 for communications between the patient home and the simulated telehealth platform provider. Accuhealth and Vivify Health use AES-256 encryption  for data-at-rest and address PR.DS-1 and PR.DS-P1. 5.7 Anomalies and Events, Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.AE, DE.CM), and Data Processing Management (CT.DM-P) The project team implemented LogRhythmXDR as a security incident and event management (SIEM) tool. End-point devices that include servers and network infrastructure components generate log data that were aggregated in the SIEM tool for analysis. LogRhythm included two components: NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 56 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.LogRhythmXDR and LogRhythm NetworkXDR. SIEM capabilities provide security engineers a baseline of network operations and allow security engineers to determine expected dataflows for users and systems. Engineers can detect events and analyze potential threats. LogRhythmXDR, therefore, is a SIEM that addresses NIST Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories ID.RA-5, PR.PT-1, DE.AE-1, DE.AE-2, ID.RA- P4, and CT.DM-P8. LogRhythm NetworkXDR provides capabilities that assure that the network is monitored for potential cybersecurity threats. It also provides assurance that unauthorized mobile code is detected and, thus, addresses DE.CM-7. This practice guide assures implementation of a network monitoring capability based on regular log collection and applies the SIEM analytics and automated response capabilities. The project team implemented Cisco Firepower, Cisco Stealthwatch, and Cisco Umbrella, which detects malicious code, detects unauthorized mobile code and provides continuous network monitoring and analytics. Therefore, the Cisco suite addresses DE.CM-4 and DE.CM-5. 6 Functional Evaluation This practice guide uses the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Cybersecurity Framework includes Category and Subcategory concepts that allowed the project team to develop a reference architecture. The reference architecture reflects use cases and dataflows analyzed by the NCCoE. This practice guide aligns privacy and cybersecurity tools to Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories. The reference architecture depicts where tools were deployed. 6.1 RPM Functional Test Plan One aspect of our security evaluation involved assessing how well the reference design addresses the security characteristics that it was intended to support. The Cybersecurity Framework Categories and Subcategories were used to provide structure to the security assessment by consulting the specific sections of each standard that are cited in reference to a Subcategory. The cited sections provide validation points that the example solution would be expected to exhibit. Using the Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories as a basis for organizing our analysis allowed us to systematically consider how well the reference design supports the intended security characteristics. 6.1.1 RPM Functional Evaluation Table 6-1 identifies the RPM functional evaluation addressed in the test plan and associated test cases. The evaluations are aligned with the basic architecture design and capability requirements from Section 4, Architecture.

In the address bar, type in the address of Cisco’s malware test page, examplemalwaredomain.com. 23. Check if the site does not load and a Cisco Umbrella block message is displayed. Expected Results  When the Cisco Umbrella policy is active, devices within the HDO environment will not be able to access potentially malicious web services outside the HDO. Actual Results To start, the Cisco Umbrella policy applied to the Forwarder appliances was not configured to block external sites that have been flagged for potential malware. Using a workstation in the Clinical Workstations VLAN, we navigated to a test malware site hosted by Cisco (examplemalwaredomain.com) to verify Cisco Umbrella’s effectiveness. Without the malware policy in place, the workstation was able to successfully reach the test malware site. After this, the Cisco Umbrella policy was configured to block external sites that have been flagged for potential malware. With the policy in place, the workstation was used again to connect to the test malware site, this time receiving a Cisco Umbrella block page notifying us that access to the site was not permitted. 6.1.7 Test Case: RPM-7 Cybersecurity Framework Security Continuous Monitoring Category Testable Requirement(s) (CR-9) malicious activity detection Description Demonstrate the ability to detect anomalous network traffic and create an alert for further investigation.

NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 80 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.7 Future Build Considerations This practice guide implemented biometric devices that used cellular data communications. This guide also addressed biometric devices using broadband communications. The practice guide implemented Onclave Networks as a proof-of-concept solution that provides layer 2 over layer 3 protection in a zero trust architecture model. This practice guide simulated a telehealth platform provider and deployed the Onclave solution to demonstrate how data communications between the patient home and telehealth platform provider may be secured. The solution assures that biometric devices are segmented from other devices that may appear in a patient home network. A future build may also implement an EHR system that would receive automated data from the telehealth platform provider.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides two bodies of work that enable organizations to examine risk and determine how risks may be mitigated. The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) uses the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as guidance for managing risks in healthcare technology. Dovetailing with the Cybersecurity Framework is the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). This appendix discusses how the Cybersecurity Framework and the RMF may be applied when managing risks for the remote patient monitoring (RPM) environment. C-1 Discussion on the Risk Management Framework This practice guide implements concepts in the NIST RMF . The NIST RMF consists of a series of documents that may be applied in categorizing systems, selecting controls, assessing controls, and monitoring the security state of the overall architecture. The RMF captures this concept by describing a six-step process. The RMF security life cycle can be described as follows: Step Description Guidance Document(s) 1 categorize Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 ; NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60 ,  2 select FIPS 200 ; NIST SP 800-53  3 implement NIST SP 800-70  4 assess NIST SP 800-53A  5 authorize NIST SP 800-37  6 monitor NIST SP 800-37 ; NIST SP 800-53A  NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 88 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.Figure C-1 Risk Management Framework  Note that this practice guide does not apply the RMF sequentially as described. The NIST RMF, in this stepped approach, applies to new systems as they are evaluated for their suitability to transition from development to production environments. For this RPM practice guide, components are already developed. The approach that the project team uses in applying the RMF is first categorizing the system, then assessing risk and understanding threats that may result in risk. The team then selects controls to disrupt threats. C-2 Information and Information System Categorization An initial step in performing a system risk assessment and then selecting and applying appropriate controls is to perform an information and information system categorization exercise. A method to categorize is described in NIST SP 800-60 Volumes I and II  , as well as in FIPS 199 . These documents are a foundational step in the NIST Risk Management Framework. The NIST SP 800-60 volumes provide guidance on identifying information categories and provide recommended categorization, based on confidentiality (C), integrity (I), and availability (A) security objectives. In reviewing information types described in NIST SP 800-60 Volume II , the engineers selected two information types as relevant for the representative build: C.2.8.9, personal identity and authentication; and D.14.1, access to care. The two information types were recorded in Table C-1, Information Types and Categorizations, and provisional impact levels were captured, with the category levels corresponding to the recommended value found in NIST SP 800-60 Volume II . NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 89 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.Table C-1 Information Types and Categorizations Information Type NIST SP 800-60 Confidentiality Integrity Availability Justification Volume II (to change an impact Reference level) (e.g., C.2.8.9) personal identity C.2.8.9 moderate moderate moderate N/A and authentication access to care D.14.1 low moderate low N/A Overall Rating moderate moderate moderate N/A After identifying the information categories, one may determine the security objectives. Security objectives use a scale of low, medium, and high. FIPS 199 provides guidance in applying security categorization (SC). This practice guide identifies two information types: personal identity and authentication, as well as access to care. RPMʼs SC may be expressed as {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, MODERATE), (availability, MODERATE)} . The SC provides a base guide for security controls selection. C-3 Risk Context This practice guide describes risk from a systemic perspective while contextualizing risk. The RPM system for this practice guide consists of three domains. For this document, a domain is a group of assets whose maintenance and underlying infrastructure are the responsibility of discrete entities. In RPM, this practice guide implements a reference architecture that uses the patient home, the telehealth platform provider, and the healthcare delivery organization (HDO) as domains. Because each domain is managed and used by different entities, risks and threats may manifest differently in each domain. While HDOs and telehealth platform providers are corporate entities that are subject to regulatory obligations, the patient home tends to be managed by individuals. For RPM, HDOs and telehealth platform providers should provide guidance to patients in safeguarding their systems and information. Controls may be implemented on provisioned devices managed by HDOs or telehealth platform providers; however, other controls may need to be addressed through education and awareness. Despite how controls may be implemented, this practice guide examines the contextualized risks and threats and describes how the NCCoE implemented mitigating controls. Organizations that implement RPM practices should ensure that they apply due diligence by examining their own risk scenarios, including legal and regulatory obligations that may apply to their locale. Risks and threats should be NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 90 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.analyzed based on their context. This practice guide applies contextualized controls to disrupt threats as its strategy to mitigate risk. C-4 Threats In this practice guide, the NCCoE identified a threat taxonomy for the entire system. Threats may manifest differently to the system depending on the domain in which they appear. Environments that may have resources to maintain security tools and procedures may have mitigating circumstances that reduce the likelihood of attack and minimize impact based on pervasive controls. This practice guide considers scenarios where patient homes may have less resource and capability to minimize threats when compared with telehealth platform providers and HDOs. Also, for the purposes of this practice guide, some threats may target HDOs to a greater extent than patient homes or telehealth platform providers, given a more target-rich data set that may attract threat actors. The following tables describe events and consider the likelihood of variation based on this context. Note that the assigned values are notional. Practitioners who perform similar exercises may determine different assignments. For purposes of this exercise, likelihood is categorized using a range that extends from very low to very high, consistent with a model described in Appendix G of NIST 800-30 . An abstract of the table appears below. The qualitative values from the Table C-2 describes threat likelihood.

The patient home may include technology and network infrastructure that offer malicious actors the opportunity to introduce disruption. Patients and individuals in the patient home come from different walks of life and may have varying degrees of experience in ensuring that privacy and cybersecurity are appropriately implemented for the devices that they may use. Malicious actors may opportunistically leverage a lack of robust controls in the patient home. While the patient home environment may have limited data to exfiltrate and data that pertain to a few individuals, the ability to compromise a patient home environment may pose fewer challenges than better resourced companies and hospital systems.

C data exfiltration Sensitive data may be exposed to moderate unauthorized individuals, e.g., via social engineering disclosure or malware that allows threat actors to retrieve data arbitrarily. Malware may be used for this purpose. Using the same threat matrix, an examination is made of the telehealth platform provider. In general, the threat table considers when threat actors target workforce members who may have privileged access. The assumption is that telehealth platform providers may implement pervasive controls and have privacy and cybersecurity resources deployed that mitigate likelihood. The caveat in these assumptions is that HDOs that engage with telehealth platform providers should be provided assurance that third parties that they engage deploy mature privacy and cybersecurity programs.

Such type of attack could also be used to damage a device, e.g., through accelerated battery depletion. C-5 Threat Sources Threat sources describe those groups or individuals that may expose weaknesses to the RPM infrastructure. Threat sources may take actions that expose or leverage vulnerabilities either through unintentional actions or by actively attacking components within the RPM infrastructure. The following table lists the threat sources identified for this risk assessment. The table is derived from one referenced in NIST Special Publication 800-30 revision 1 (page D-2) .

Table C-7 identifies these and other business processes that support the RPM functions.

C-6 Vulnerabilities Below is a customized application on identifying vulnerabilities that aggregates vulnerabilities identified in NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 . As noted in the document, a vulnerability is a deficiency or weakness that a threat source may exploit, resulting in a threat event. The document further describes that vulnerabilities may exist in a broader context, i.e., that they may be found in organizational governance structures, external relationships, and mission/business processes. The following table enumerates those vulnerabilities, using a holistic approach, and represents those vulnerabilities that this project identified and for which it offers guidance. For further description, readers should reference NIST SP 800-30 Revision 1 .

C-7 Threat Modeling Thus far, this practice guide has discussed several elements that make up an attack. Threats involve threat actors that may leverage vulnerabilities found in components. Components represent end-point devices found in the overall system. Components are made up of several subcomponents. The threat- modeling exercise described below identifies adverse actions that may expose vulnerabilities at the subcomponent level. This practice guide considers that threats may include multiple actions taken that ultimately result in risk. These multiple actions are described herein as adverse actions. A threat may involve one or more adverse actions leveraging vulnerabilities at the subcomponent level that then result in risk. The patient home environment is used as a representative domain by which the threat-modeling exercise is applied. Practitioners may wish to perform a similar, granular level of analysis for other domains in their deployment. For the RPM solution, components are identified in three distinct domains: the patient home, the telehealth platform provider, and the HDO. This section describes a means by which threats may occur contextually. Adverse actions that align with threats may target specific subcomponents, with different risk outcomes based on the domain within which the threat actor executes the attack. Practitioners should note that while this practice guide does not apply any particular threat-modeling methodology, several are available that provide guidance for performing similar exercises for an organization’s environment. C-7.1 Modeling Threats to the Patient Home The patient home domain poses several challenges when considering threats. For example, patients or care providers may not have the resources or technology background to address these threats independently. Telehealth platform providers and HDOs may not have the ability to manage the patient home environment entirely. Patients may have devices that are unrelated to RPM operating in their home environment. Other individuals within the patient home may have physical access to RPM devices. Components that may be present in the RPM system’s environment are outlined in Table C-9.

This may biometric device include guests or unknown individuals. interface device internet router Wi-Fi access point The RPM solution deployed in the patient home is not a closed system. Elements that may be provisioned by the patient include Wi-Fi or cellular access points and the internet router. Further, the patient may have other devices on the home network. These may include connected home devices, personal computers, mobile devices, and gaming and entertainment systems. The biometric device may consist of several subcomponents. Biometric devices may have PAN interfaces that support short-distance communication (e.g., Bluetooth). Biometric devices may also support Wi-Fi NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 105 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.connectivity. A biometric device has a tactile interface that makes physical contact with an individual. There may be a display that acts as a user interface, and there may be storage media embedded in the device. There may be onboard storage. Physical external interfaces are ports for data communication (e.g., Universal Serial Bus [USB]), acceptance of removable media (e.g., SD card), and power. Threats may be introduced based on the proximity of the subcomponent, as described in Table C-10. Threats that involve physical interaction with the subcomponent may be regarded as "local". Threats that originate from an external network may be regarded as "remote". Threats that use communications that are contained within the local environment may be described as "near remote".

The adverse actions that the threat-modeling exercise included in themselves do not represent the enterprise threat environment but, rather, events that may occur that, in combination, may be how threats are found in the three domains that the practice guide describes as composing the RPM architecture.

Privacy concerns should be addressed particularly in healthcare environments. The project team examined the NIST Privacy Framework and included approaches that lead toward better understanding and managing the privacy risks that may be present in remote patient monitoring (RPM) deployments. Structurally, the NIST Privacy Framework is like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Both frameworks should be applied when evaluating enterprise programs and developing mitigation strategies. Applying the Privacy Framework does not supersede the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Rather, the Privacy Framework provides organizations with information to understand privacy-specific risks. For more information about the NIST Privacy Framework, healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) should review NIST Privacy Framework: A Tool for Improving Privacy through Enterprise Risk Management, Version 1.0 . D-1 Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology The project team applied the NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM) to conduct a privacy risk assessment for the RPM architecture. The PRAM helps an organization analyze privacy risks and facilitates communication regarding how it is managing privacy risks to achieve business/mission objectives. Processing can include collection, retention, logging, analysis, generation, transformation, merging, disclosure, transfer, and disposal of data. The PRAM also uses the privacy risk model and privacy engineering objectives described in NIST Internal Report 8062  to analyze data processing for problematic data actions. A problematic data action is any data processing operation that could lead to an adverse effect, or problem, for individuals. The occurrence or potential occurrence of problematic data actions is a privacy event. For this RPM solution, the PRAM helped elucidate how RPM solutions can present privacy concerns for individuals. The PRAM, being a risk assessment, also supports the risk assessment task in the Prepare step of the NIST Risk Management Framework as discussed in Section C-1 of this guide. The privacy events identified are discussed in Section C-2. A blank version of the PRAM is available for download on NIST’s website . When conducting the PRAM for this RPM solution, metadata was not assessed as it is out of scope for this project; therefore, this practice guide does not provide guidance to help an organization with securing any possible metadata if it may be leaked on devices within the telehealth ecosystem. An organization should consider the risk that could result from this incident occurring in its telehealth ecosystem. Figure D-1 depicts the privacy view of the RPM solution dataflow and was used to conduct the privacy risk assessment. The dataflow is broken into seven data processing activities (described here as “data actions” and appearing in the diagram as a sequence labelled from 1 to 7). The dataflow shows the NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 119 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.relationships between the key operators throughout the full lifecycle of the solution as well as the types of data processing that occur as the data moves between operators. The operators include the patient, biometric device, RPM mobile device, biometric device vendor, telehealth platform, and the HDO (comprised of the Clinician and electronic health record). Symbols are used to depict the types of data actions performed, including collection, retention/logging, generation/transformation, disclosure/transfer, disposal. Data Action 1 shows the patient connecting to a biometric device so that it can begin collecting readings. Data Action 2 shows that the biometric data generated by the patient is read by and retained on the biometric device before being transmitted to either the RPM Mobile Device (via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) or the Biometric Device Vendor (via cellular network) when a retrieval request is sent. Data Action 3 describes two possible paths for collecting biometric data, one via an RPM Mobile Device, and another via the Biometric Device Vendor. The RPM Mobile Device or Biometric Device Vendor collects and retains the biometric data and then forwards the biometric data to the Telehealth Platform. Data Action 4 shows that patient data may be generated or transformed as the Telehealth Platform evaluates and correlates data and alerts the clinician when a patient data threshold is passed. The Telehealth Platform also maintains a history of readings and trends. Data Action 5 shows that the Clinician accesses the Telehealth Platform, evaluates the patient data and determines whether and how to respond, which may generate additional patient data. When needed, the Clinician also transfers patient data to update the EHR for later reference. Data Action 6 shows that the Clinician may meet with the patient using an PRM Mobile Device. This interaction may result in collection and of additional information that is stored in the EHR. Data Action 7 shows that HDOs may choose to initiate a patient survey The diagram shows that the Data Actions 4-7 are out of the scope of this solution and the privacy risk assessment.

Problematic data actions are discovered by conducting a privacy risk assessment and analyzing the likelihood that an operation performed by a system would create a problem for individuals when processing data and the impact of the problematic data action should it occur. This section provides representative problematic data actions identified in the RPM architecture and the mitigations that an organization may use to reduce or prevent potential risk. The discussion of problematic data actions is structured as follows:  Privacy Risk: descriptive name for the issue that can arise in the RPM solution from data processing  Data Action: a data life-cycle operation in the RPM solution, including collection, retention, logging, generation, transformation, use, disclosure, sharing, transmission, and disposal NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 121 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30. Problematic Data Action: a data action in the RPM solution that could cause an adverse effect for individuals (based on the NIST Catalog of Problematic Data Actions and Problems)  Potential Problems for Individuals: discussion regarding the nature of the problematic data action and the specific privacy problems that can arise for patients (based on the NIST Catalog of Problematic Data Actions and Problems)  Mitigations: examples of mitigations for the problematic data action, including those that this RPM solution addresses as well as other mitigations that organizations may wish to consider beyond the direct capabilities built into their RPM solution D-2.1 Privacy Risk 1: Storage and movement of data create multiple points of potential exposure after data are collected from the patient Data Action: Patients’ readings are taken from the biometric device and forwarded to the telehealth platform. Problematic Data Action: Insecurity Potential Problems for Individuals: Data shared between devices in the RPM data ecosystem may not be protected at rest or in transit. Data may include sensitive information. Unauthorized data disclosure may result in patient harm. For example, disclosure could lead to dignity loss or embarrassment or may cause patients to distrust the RPM system. The solution relies on communication between the patient’s biometric device(s) and the HDO. Biometric devices forward the information to the HDO via the telehealth platform provider. In this solution, data flow from the biometric device either directly to the telehealth platform provider or are routed via an RPM mobile device via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or over the cellular network. Each device, system, and dataflow in the process introduces an exposure point, several of which would not arise in a traditional healthcare setting, such as a doctor’s appointment (e.g., if the patient’s reading is taken in a doctor’s office). Any failure to protect data stored on the biometric and RPM mobile devices and forwarded may allow unauthorized individuals to view sensitive information. In this event, someone other than a patient- approved individual can access data that are unencrypted on the biometric device or RPM mobile device or during forwarding. The patient may experience dignity loss due to their health information being exposed and may also experience loss of trust for the HDO and RPM mobile device. Mitigation(s): RPM Solution Mitigation: Physical device security is out of scope for this lab solution. Protect data at rest and in transit between devices and telehealth platforms. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 122 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.Protecting data on the biometric device, e.g., by using encryption, prior to moving it to the telehealth platform and using encrypted connections to protect the contents of data in transit reduces the risk of exposure. Robust network security controls should be in place to help protect data in transit. For example, firewalls and network access control will help secure the data against ransomware, malware, and other attacks. If data are not encrypted, unauthorized individuals may be able to retrieve the data, which can lead to inappropriate use of information. Encryption methods should be used in preventing health information disclosure. Additional Privacy Mitigations for Organizations to Consider: Develop and adopt enterprise encryption policies. Policies should be created, developed, and adopted for systematically categorizing and classifying all healthcare data, including metadata, no matter where the data are stored. D-2.2 Privacy Risk 2: Biometric device types can indicate patient health problems that individuals would prefer not to disclose beyond their healthcare provider Data Action: Patients are provided one or more biometric devices that monitor biometric data and send that data to their healthcare providers to help assess the physical health condition of the patient between visits with the provider. Problematic Data Action: Unanticipated Revelation Potential Problems for Individuals: Patients with given medical conditions may use certain biometric devices, alone or in combination. If communications from these devices are accessed by unauthorized individuals, they may disclose particular health problems. For example, a glucometer can indicate that a patient is being monitored for diabetes. This assumption could be more obvious if that same patient is also known to be using a blood pressure monitor, weight scale, and activity tracker. Patient sensitivities regarding their health status can vary widely. Unauthorized individuals may be able to determine a patientʼs medical condition based on knowing a combination of factors. For example, knowledge of the device type and the biometric data may enable individuals to conclude the patientʼs health condition. Revealing a health condition that a patient would prefer not to disclose or disclosure of a patientʼs medical treatment and their course of treatment outside their healthcare provider can lead to dignity loss, such as embarrassment, emotional distress, and loss of trust in the HDO and RPM system. This could damage the relationship with a patient, including losing the opportunity for the HDO to continue providing care. Intercepting communications sessions may have a lower likelihood of occurrence than aggregated data compromise. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 123 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.When biometric devices participate in an RPM solution, they may share device metadata (e.g., device identifiers, device type, or manufacturer) as they communicate with the vendor, telehealth platform, or the HDO. This device metadata may reveal the information that indicates a patient condition (e.g., type of device). Additionally, communications may be vulnerable to eavesdropping, which could give away the device type. Evaluating device metadata and communications should be included in the organization’s risk assessment. Mitigation(s): RPM Solution Mitigation(s): Protect data transmitted between parties and in storage. Data-in-transit protection, e.g., by encrypting communications channels, reduces the risk of compromise of information transmitted between parties. Reducing the risk of compromise and any resulting exposures reduces the risk of unintentional exposure of the information. Biometric devices communicate through a mobile device that uses a Bluetooth connection, and the RPM solution assumes that these devices are deployed using an appropriate encryption mode  . The RPM solution uses devices that are equipped to communicate over 4G long-term evolution (LTE), which uses asymmetric encryption between the device and the cellular tower. Additionally, all data at rest is protected with AES-256 encryption . Limit or disable access to data. Conduct a system-specific privacy risk assessment to determine how access to data in the telehealth platform provider can be limited. Using access controls to limit staff access to biometric and patient data can be important in preventing associating health conditions with specific individuals. D-2.3 Privacy Risk 3: Incorrect data capture of readings by devices may impact quality of patient care Data Action: The RPM solution relies on the patient to take readings by using the patient’s assigned biometric device(s) when required according to their care plan. Problematic Data Action: Distortion Potential Problems for Individuals: Devices may be inaccurately applied by the patient (e.g., not properly using or inadvertently changing settings), which can impact the ability of a biometric device to take proper readings. Anomalies may also be introduced by other individuals who may have physical access to the device (e.g., allowing someone other than the patient to use the device), which may introduce biometric readings other than the patientʼs into the system. Data integrity may be compromised, causing confusion regarding the patient’s actual health and possibly leading to physical harm to the patient.

Ultimately, responsibility for monitoring patient data, including identifying anomalies, falls on the clinician. Additional Privacy Mitigations for Organizations to Consider: Educate patients regarding practices for handling biometric device(s) and the importance of following their monitoring plan. Educating patients regarding how their interactions with the biometric devices assigned to them affect the quality of the data provided to the telehealth platform provider, HDO, healthcare provider, and ultimately the quality of care they receive and their health safety will encourage them to use the biometric devices as designed and intended. D-2.4 Privacy Risk 4: Aggregated data may expose patient information Data Action: Patients use one or more biometric devices to monitor the condition of their health. The biometric data generated are transmitted through multiple entities, including cellular or broadband internet providers, biometric device vendors, telehealth platform providers, cloud service providers, and HDOs before reaching the healthcare provider. Problematic Data Action: Re-identification Potential Problems for Individuals: The RPM architecture integrates data from multiple organizations, each of which may have different data that pertain to the patient. The biometric data generated by the solution indicates an individual’s health status. Aggregation of biometric data with patient identifiers associates information about the patient that, if revealed to an entity other than their healthcare provider and care team, may result in dignity losses, such as embarrassment or emotional distress, as well as loss of trust in the HDO and provider. Mitigation(s): RPM Solution Mitigation(s): Combine biometric data with patient identifiers only when operationally required. The device manufacturer may aggregate data received from patients. Biometric data do not include patient identifiers but will include device identifiers. The telehealth platform provider may associate the biometric data to patients by using device identifiers. In this RPM solution, the telehealth platform provider does not combine these data until the point at which it is necessary to perform patient analytics that enable the healthcare delivery organization to manage the patient’s care. The NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 125 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.telehealth platform provider uses a biometric device identifier to correlate a patient with the biometric data that a device transmits. Protect data transmitted between parties and in storage. Data protection, e.g., by using encryption, reduces the risk that compromised data can be easily used and combined with other data to re-identify patients. Biometric devices communicate through a mobile device that uses Bluetooth connections, and the RPM solution assumes that these devices are deployed using an appropriate encryption mode  . The RPM solution uses devices that are equipped to communicate over 4G LTE, which uses asymmetric encryption between the device and the cellular tower. Additionally, all data at rest is protected with AES-256 encryption. D-2.5 Privacy Risk 5: Exposure of patient information through multiple providers of system components increases the likelihood of exposure of patient data to unintended recipients Data Action: Data about individuals and their devices flow between various applications and analytical tools, some of which are managed by third parties. Problematic Data Action: Unanticipated Revelation Potential Problems for Individuals: Multiple organizations work together to provide individual components of the RPM solution, and each organization that plays a role in data processing represents an exposure point for patient information. Patient biometric data travel from devices to the HDO through device vendors and telehealth platform providers over cellular and broadband networks. Some of the data also flows through cloud solutions. These third parties beyond the HDO and patient’s provider may conduct system monitoring, analytics, and other operational activities as part of the solution. System administrators have access to otherwise private healthcare information through knowledge of biometric device types and the data they generate, which may reveal information about patients that results in dignity losses, such as embarrassment or emotional distress. Data transmission about patients and their biometric devices among a variety of different parties could be confusing for patients who might not know who has access to information about them. This transmission could reveal personal information about the patient to parties they would not expect to have such information. This lack of patient visibility and awareness of data-sharing practices may also cause patient loss of trust in the provider. Additionally, the communications between RPM devices and systems generate metadata that may pose additional risk of exposure. For example, device identifiers in some contexts may indicate the type of device that is communicating, which can provide insights into a patient’s condition even without viewing NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 126 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.the data transmitted. Metadata was not evaluated as part of this solution; however, organizations planning to implement RPM solutions should include an evaluation of metadata in their risk assessment. Mitigation(s): RPM Solution Mitigation(s): Combine biometric data with patient identifiers only when operationally required. The device manufacturer may aggregate data received from patients. Biometric data do not include patient identifiers, however, will include device identifiers. The telehealth platform provider may associate the biometric data to patients by using device identifiers. In this RPM solution, the telehealth platform provider does not combine these data until the point at which it is necessary to perform patient analytics that enable the healthcare delivery organization to manage the patient’s care. The telehealth platform provider uses a biometric device identifier to correlate the biometric data with a patient. Protect data transmitted between parties and in storage. Data protection, e.g., using encryption, reduces the risk of compromise of information transmitted between parties. Biometric devices communicate through a mobile device that uses Bluetooth connections, and the RPM solution assumes that these devices are deployed using an appropriate encryption mode. The RPM solution uses devices that are equipped to communicate over 4G LTE, which uses asymmetric encryption between the device and the cellular tower  . Additionally, all data at rest is protected with AES-256 encryption. Limit or disable collection of specific data elements. Conduct a system-specific privacy risk assessment to determine what elements can be limited. The RPM solution sends only biometric and device data from the device to the RPM interface and vendors and excludes identifying information about the patient. This would limit insight into patient health status by outsiders or telehealth platform provider administrators if the security of the information is compromised. Additional Privacy Mitigations for Organizations to Consider: Limit or disable access to data. Conduct a system-specific privacy risk assessment to determine how access to data can be limited. Using access controls to limit staff access to compliance information, especially when associated with patients, can be important in preventing association of specific biometric data with individuals. Use contracts to limit third-party data processing. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 127 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.Establish contractual policies to limit data processing by third parties to only the processing that facilitates delivery of security services and to no data processing beyond those explicit purposes. D-3 Additional Program Mitigations Applicable Across Various Data Actions Organizations that deploy RPM solutions will conduct their own risk assessment and determine what mitigations are most appropriate for their environment, including organizational activities outside the direct control of their RPM solution. This section includes several examples of mitigations that may be common across the organization and is not intended to be all-encompassing. Mitigations: Ensure that privacy notices address end-to-end dataflows in the RPM solution between patient and provider. RPM solutions empower patients as active participants in their healthcare. Privacy notices—information such as the data collected about the patient, the reason they are collected, how they are processed by an organization, how they are protected, and how long an organization plans to use them—are one way that HDOs can help patients understand their relationship and expectations with an organization. Privacy notices are also a precursor to requesting consent so that patients understand what agreements they are making and how to withdraw consent at any time during the program. Effective notices that cover the RPM solution should be specific enough to help patients understand the PRM solution and should be written in clear terms that are easily understood by any individuals (i.e., individuals do not need healthcare, RPM, or privacy expertise to interpret the privacy notice). Patients may not be aware of or easily able to discern what is happening with the information generated by their biometric device(s), such as analytics and trend analyses that telehealth platform providers can conduct and how a provider may use this information for their care. Information regarding the RPM solution that includes a discussion of privacy helps patients better understand how the system processes their data, which enhances predictability. One example of providing an effective RPM privacy notice would be to create an RPM website or pamphlet, separate from the overall operational privacy notice that an HDO may have, that explains the RPM program. Provide a support point of contact. Providing patients with a point of contact in the organization who can respond to privacy inquiries and concerns regarding the RPM solution helps patients better understand how the system processes their data, which enhances predictability. Define and communicate clear retention policies. To minimize security and privacy risk to patients (e.g., deciding based on outdated data that could impact the quality of care provided through an RPM solution), HDOs should use the results of their risk assessment to determine how each solution component impacts their retention policies for each step in NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 128 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.the dataflow process. When an HDO relies on other entities to support data processing activities, the HDO should clearly communicate its data retention and privacy risk management needs to those entities. Implement program-specific privacy and security training and awareness activities. Privacy and security may be compromised while performing business functions if employees do not understand how to incorporate security and privacy practices into their operational activities. Each organization that plays a role in healthcare RPM solutions must evaluate its role in the data ecosystem, the privacy and security risks that arise in the context of that role, and the training and awareness activities that will be most impactful for addressing those risks. Establish and communicate a process for patients to withdraw from the program. HDOs should work with their privacy program to consider in advance the privacy implications when patients decide to no longer participate in the RPM program and the processes that must occur to conclude their participation. For example, organizations will have data retention considerations for managing patient information collected as part of the program. HDOs should assure patients are aware that they have the ability to withdraw their consent prior to and during their participation in the program and that they have instructions for withdrawal. For example, HDOs may provide potential participants information regarding withdrawal from the program and who to contact with questions about that process in the telehealth informed consent documentation prior to their enrollment in the program. HDOs should consider an explicit consent model rather than an implicit consent. Patients may also directly request removal of their data from the RPM platform. HDOs will need to establish capabilities for decommissioning patients in the RPM solution as well as for communicating any related requirements to platform providers and other partners in the RPM solution. Appendix E Benefits of IoT Device Cybersecurity Requirements The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT) program  supports development and application of standards, guidelines, and related tools to improve the cybersecurity of connected devices and the environments in which they are deployed. By collaborating with stakeholders across government, industry, international bodies, and academia, the program aims to cultivate trust and foster an environment that enables innovation on a global scale. Computing devices that integrate physical and/or sensing capabilities and network interface capabilities are being designed, developed, and deployed at an ever-increasing pace. These devices are fulfilling customer needs in all sectors of the economy. Many of these computing devices are connected to the internet. IoT devices combine network connectivity with the ability to sense or affect the physical world. Individuals may find challenges with applying privacy and cybersecurity controls as devices include greater functionality. NIST SP 1800-30B: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 129 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.NIST’s Cybersecurity for IoT program has defined a baseline set of device cybersecurity capabilities that manufacturers should consider integrating into their IoT devices and that consumers should consider enabling/configuring in those devices. Device cybersecurity capabilities are cybersecurity features or functions that IoT devices provide through their own technical means (i.e., device hardware and software). Nontechnical supporting capabilities are actions that a manufacturer or third-party organization performs in support of the cybersecurity of an IoT device. Examples of nontechnical support include providing information about software updates, instructions for configuration settings, and supply chain information. Used together, device cybersecurity capabilities and nontechnical supporting capabilities can help mitigate cybersecurity risks related to the use of IoT devices while assisting customers in achieving their goals. Device cybersecurity capabilities and nontechnical supporting capabilities—if properly defined and integrated into the RPM devices and RPM architectural environment—can assist in securely deploying and configuring an RPM ecosystem. E-1 Device Capabilities Mapping Table E-1 below builds on the Security Control Map in Section 3.5 of this document. The table lists both device cybersecurity capabilities and nontechnical supporting capabilities that map to NIST Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories that were considered relevant to RPM ecosystem risks. Selecting devices and/or third parties that provide these capabilities can support the secure deployment and configuration of the RPM ecosystem. The column listing mapping from Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule is included as an important sector-specific standard. Note: In the table below, the HIPAA Security Rule elements listed in the last column were previously mapped to the Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories. The device cybersecurity capabilities and nontechnical supporting capabilities listed were mapped to the Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories, not to the HIPAA Security Rule elements. In this sense, the Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories served as the central element joining the device cybersecurity capabilities and nontechnical supporting capabilities with the HIPAA Security Rule elements.

The International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) describe the OSI model as consisting of seven layers called Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical, where layers are numerically ordered in reverse. That is, the Application Layer is regarded as Layer 7, whereas the Physical Layer is regarded as Layer 1 . Layer 2 aligns with the OSI model’s Data link layer. Devices operating at Layer 2 have media access control (MAC) addresses by which devices, such as biometric devices, may communicate across a local area network (LAN) segment. Layer 3 aligns with the OSI model’s Network layer. Devices implement the Network layer with Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Layer 2 over Layer 3 solutions enable devices that do not implement the Network layer to have broader interconnectivity. Layer 2 over Layer 3 solutions provide security by limiting access to devices and securing the data-in-transit communications, e.g., with encryption. Layer 2 over Layer 3 solutions may be used to create secure enclaves, grouping small numbers of devices that may require enhanced network security. Creating secure enclaves aligns with the concept of micro-segmentation. Organizations may consider Layer 2 over Layer 3 solutions for devices that may be prone to internet threats. Biometric devices may implement Layer 2 and Layer 3 interconnectivity; however, they do not have robust controls that prevent unauthorized remote access. Secure enclaves may be created that encapsulate biometric devices with other devices when secure cross communication is required. This practice guide deployed a Layer 2 over Layer 3 solution as part of a proof of concept within the healthcare lab. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture , describes an enclave gateway model that may be applied to a telehealth remote patient monitoring (RPM) architecture. In the enclave gateway model, a zero-trust solution operates in two conceptual planes: a control and a data plane. Micro-segmentation management devices operate in a control plane. These management devices provide administrative and policy capabilities to support secure enclaves. Operational components, such as biometric devices, telehealth platform provider services, and devices hosted by healthcare delivery organizations, may operate in the data plane. Figure F-1 depicts the enclave gateway model.

Managed biometric devices may be subject to threats that may be present in the patient home network. The Layer 2 over Layer 3 approach segments the RPM components from other devices that may operate in the patient home. Devices not associated with the deployed RPM components do not have a communication pathway to the RPM devices. ZTA allows the biometric devices to authenticate into the Layer 2 over Layer 3 security solution so that only traffic from the RPM components traverses the Layer 2 over Layer 3 network. Practitioners should refer to NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture, for guidance .

This public-private partnership enables the creation of practical cybersecurity solutions for specific industries, as well as for broad, cross-sector technology challenges. Through consortia under Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), including technology partners—from Fortune 50 market leaders to smaller companies specializing in information technology security—the NCCoE applies standards and best practices to develop modular, adaptable example cybersecurity solutions using commercially available technology. The NCCoE documents these example solutions in the NIST Special Publication 1800 series, which maps capabilities to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and details the steps needed for another entity to re-create the example solution. The NCCoE was established in 2012 by NIST in partnership with the State of Maryland and Montgomery County, Maryland. To learn more about the NCCoE, visit https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/.

NIST CYBERSECURITY PRACTICE GUIDES NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guides (Special Publication 1800 series) target specific cybersecurity challenges in the public and private sectors. They are practical, user-friendly guides that facilitate the adoption of standards-based approaches to cybersecurity. They show members of the information security community how to implement example solutions that help them align with relevant standards and best practices and provide users with the lists of materials, configuration files, and other information they need to implement a similar approach. The documents in this series describe example implementations of cybersecurity practices that businesses and other organizations may voluntarily adopt. These documents do not describe regulations or mandatory practices, nor do they carry statutory authority. ABSTRACT Increasingly, healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) are relying on telehealth and remote patient monitoring (RPM) capabilities to treat patients at home. RPM is convenient and cost-effective, and its adoption rate has increased. However, without adequate privacy and cybersecurity measures, unauthorized individuals may expose sensitive data or disrupt patient monitoring services. RPM solutions engage multiple actors as participants in a patient’s clinical care. These actors include HDOs, telehealth platform providers, and the patients themselves. Each participant uses, manages, and maintains different technology components within an interconnected ecosystem, and each is NIST SP 1800-30C: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem iii This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.responsible for safeguarding their piece against unique threats and risks associated with RPM technologies. This practice guide assumes that the HDO engages with a telehealth platform provider that is a separate entity from the HDO and patient. The telehealth platform provider manages a distinct infrastructure, applications, and set of services. The telehealth platform provider coordinates with the HDO to provision, configure, and deploy the RPM components to the patient home and assures secure communication between the patient and clinician. The NCCoE analyzed risk factors regarding an RPM ecosystem by using risk assessment based on the NIST Risk Management Framework. The NCCoE also leveraged the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST Privacy Framework, and other relevant standards to identify measures to safeguard the ecosystem. In collaboration with healthcare, technology, and telehealth partners, the NCCoE built an RPM ecosystem in a laboratory environment to explore methods to improve the cybersecurity of an RPM. Technology solutions alone may not be sufficient to maintain privacy and security controls on external environments. This practice guide notes the application of people, process, and technology as necessary to implement a holistic risk mitigation strategy.

We cover all of the products employed in this reference design. We do not recreate the product manufacturers’ documentation, which is presumed to be widely available. Rather, these volumes show how we incorporated the products together in our environment. Note: These are not comprehensive tutorials. There are many possible service and security configurations for these products that are out of scope for this reference design. 1.1 How-To Guide This National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Practice Guide demonstrates a standards-based reference design and provides users with the information they need to replicate the telehealth remote patient monitoring (RPM) environment. This reference design is modular and can be deployed in whole or in part. This guide contains three volumes:  NIST SP 1800-30A: Executive Summary  NIST SP 1800-30B: Approach, Architecture, and Security Characteristics–what we built and why  NIST SP 1800-30C: How-To Guides–instructions for building the example solution (you are here) Depending on your role in your organization, you might use this guide in different ways: Business decision makers, including chief security and technology officers, will be interested in the Executive Summary, NIST SP 1800-30A, which describes the following topics:  challenges that enterprises face in securing the remote patient monitoring ecosystem  example solution built at the NCCoE  benefits of adopting the example solution Technology or security program managers who are concerned with how to identify, understand, assess, and mitigate risk will be interested in NIST SP 1800-30B, which describes what we did and why. The following sections will be of particular interest:  Section 3.4, Risk Assessment, describes the risk analysis we performed.  Section 3.5, Security Control Map, maps the security characteristics of this example solution to cybersecurity standards and best practices. NIST SP 1800-30C: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 11 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.You might share the Executive Summary, NIST SP 1800-30A, with your leadership team members to help them understand the importance of adopting standards-based commercially available technologies that can help secure the RPM ecosystem. IT professionals who want to implement an approach like this will find this whole practice guide useful. You can use this How-To portion of the guide, NIST SP 1800-30C, to replicate all or parts of the build created in our lab. This How-To portion of the guide provides specific product installation, configuration, and integration instructions for implementing the example solution. We do not recreate the product manufacturers’ documentation, which is generally widely available. Rather, we show how we incorporated the products together in our environment to create an example solution. This guide assumes that IT professionals have experience implementing security products within the enterprise. While we have used a suite of commercial products to address this challenge, this guide does not endorse these particular products. Your organization can adopt this solution or one that adheres to these guidelines in whole, or you can use this guide as a starting point for tailoring and implementing parts of the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellences’ (NCCoE’s) risk assessment and deployment of a defense-in-depth strategy in a distributed RPM solution. Your organization’s security experts should identify the products that will best integrate with your existing tools and IT system infrastructure. We hope that you will seek products that are congruent with applicable standards and best practices. Section 3.6, Technologies, lists the products that we used and maps them to the cybersecurity controls provided by this reference solution. A NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide does not describe “the” solution but a possible solution. We seek feedback on its contents and welcome your input. Comments, suggestions, and success stories will improve subsequent versions of this guide. Please contribute your thoughts to hit_nccoe@nist.gov. Acronyms used in figures are in the List of Acronyms appendix. 1.2 Build Overview The NCCoE constructed a virtual lab environment to evaluate ways to implement security capabilities across an RPM ecosystem, which consists of three separate domains: patient home, telehealth platform provider, and healthcare delivery organization (HDO). The project implements virtual environments for the HDO and patient home while collaborating with a telehealth platform provider to implement a cloud-based telehealth RPM environment. The telehealth environments contain simulated patient data that portray relevant cases that clinicians could encounter in real-world scenarios. The project then applies security controls to the virtual environments. Refer to NIST Special Publication (SP) 1800-30B, Section 5, Security Characteristic Analysis, for an explanation of why we used each technology.

The HDO environment utilizes network segmenting similar to the architecture segmentation used in NIST SP 1800- 24, Securing Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) . The telehealth platform provider is a vendor-managed cloud environment that facilitates data transmissions and communications between the patient home and the HDO. Patient home environments have a minimalistic structure, which incorporates the devices provided by the telehealth platform provider. NIST SP 1800-30C: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 13 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.Figure 1-1 Final Architecture 2 Product Installation Guide This section of the practice guide contains detailed instructions for installing and configuring all the products used to build an instance of the example solution. The project team implemented several capabilities that included deploying components received from telehealth platform providers and components that represent the HDO. The telehealth platform providers provisioned biometric devices that were deployed to a patient home environment. Within the HDO, the engineers deployed network infrastructure devices to implement network zoning and configure perimeter devices. The engineers also deployed security capabilities that supported vulnerability management and a security incident and event management (SIEM) tool. The following sections detail deployment and configuration of these components. NIST SP 1800-30C: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 14 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.2.1 Telehealth Platform Provider The project team implemented a model where an HDO partners with telehealth platform providers to enable RPM programs. Telehealth platform providers are third parties that, for this practice guide, configured, deployed, and managed biometric devices and mobile devices (e.g., tablets) that were sent to the patient home. The telehealth platform provider managed data communications over cellular and broadband where patients send biometric data to the telehealth platform provider. The telehealth platform provider implemented an application that allowed clinicians to access the biometric data. The team collaborated with two independent telehealth platform providers. Collaborating with two unique platforms enabled the team to apply NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework  to multiple telehealth platform implementations. One platform provides biomedical devices enabled with cellular data. These devices transmitted biometric data to the cloud-based telehealth platform. The second platform provider deployed biometric devices enabled with Bluetooth wireless technology. Biometric devices communicated with an interface device (i.e., a tablet). The telehealth platform provider configured the interface device by using a mobile device management solution, limiting the interface device’s capabilities to those services required for RPM participation. The patient transmitted biometric data to the telehealth platform provider by using the interface device. The interface device transmitted data over cellular or broadband data communications. Both telehealth platform providers allowed HDOs to access patient data by using a web-based application. Both platforms implemented unique access control policies for access control, authentication, and authorization. Figure 2-1 depicts the different communication pathways tested in this practice guide. A detailed description of each communications pathway is provided in NIST SP 1800-30B, Section 4.2, High-Level Architecture Communications Pathways. NIST SP 1800-30C: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 15 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.Figure 2-1 RPM Communications Paths 2.1.1 Accuhealth Accuhealth provided biometric devices that included cellular data communication. Accuhealth also included a cloud-hosted application for HDOs to access patient-sent biometric data. Accuhealth provisioned biomedical devices with subscriber identity module (SIM) cards that enabled biomedical devices to transmit data via cellular data communications to the Accuhealth telehealth platform. Accuhealth stored patient-transmitted data in an application. Individuals assigned with clinician roles accessed transmitted data hosted in the Accuhealth application. The biomedical data displayed in the following screen captures are notional in nature and do not relate to an actual patient. 2.1.1.1 Patient Home–Communication Path A 14B This practice guide assumes that the HDO enrolls the patient in an RPM program. Clinicians would determine when a patient may be enrolled in the program appropriately, and conversations would occur about understanding the roles and responsibilities associated with participating in the RPM program. When clinicians enroll patients in the RPM program, the HDO would collaborate with Accuhealth. NIST SP 1800-30C: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 16 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.Accuhealth received patient contact information and configured biometric devices appropriate for the RPM program in which the patient was enrolled. Accuhealth configured biometric devices to communicate via cellular data, which is depicted as communication path A of Figure 2-1. Biometric devices. Thus, biometric devices were isolated from the patient home network environment. 2.1.1.2 HDO 15B The Accuhealth solution includes installing an application within the HDO environment. Clinicians access a portal hosted by Accuhealth that allows a clinician to view patient biometric data. The application requires unique user accounts and role-based access control. System administrators create accounts and assign roles through an administrative console. Sessions from the clinician to the hosted application use encryption to ensure data-in-transit protection. This section discusses the HDO application installation and configuration procedures. 1. Access a device that has a web browser. 2.

Vivify enabled biometric devices with Bluetooth communication and provisioned interface devices with SIM cards. Individuals provisioned with patient roles used the interface device to retrieve data from the biometric devices via Bluetooth. Individuals acting as patients then used the interface device to transmit data to Vivify by using cellular data. Vivify’s application presented the received data. Individuals provisioned with clinician roles accessed the patient-sent data stored in the Vivify application via a web interface. 2.1.2.1 Patient Home–Communication Path B This practice guide assumes that the HDO enrolls the patient in an RPM program. Clinicians would determine when a patient may be enrolled in the program appropriately, and conversations then occur about understanding the roles and responsibilities associated with participating in the RPM program. When clinicians enroll patients in the RPM program, the HDO would collaborate with Vivify. Vivify received patient contact information and configured biometric devices and an interface device (i.e., NIST SP 1800-30C: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem 20 This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1800-30.tablet) appropriate for the RPM program in which the patient was enrolled. These devices were configured to transmit data via cellular through the interface device, which is depicted as communication path B in Figure 2-1. Vivify assured device configuration and asset management. 2.1.2.2 Patient Home–Communication Paths C and D To evaluate communication path C in Figure 2-1, the project team implemented another instance of the Vivify Pathways Care Team Portal in a simulated cloud environment. The simulated cloud environment represented how a telehealth platform provider may operate; however, it does not reflect how any specific telehealth platform provider hosts its components. The simulated cloud environment deployed Vivify-provided software. One should note that the simulated cloud environment does not represent how Vivify implements its commercial service offering. The NCCoE implemented the simulated cloud environment as a test case where telehealth platforms may incorporate layer 2 over layer 3 solutions as part of their architecture. A Vivify Pathways Home kit was hosted in a patient home network, which included peripherals as well as an RPM interface. Engineers connected the RPM interface (mobile device) to the patient home network to enable broadband communications with the new simulated cloud instance. The RPM interface collected patient data from the provided peripherals via Bluetooth and then transmitted thesedata to the simulated cloud environment through the broadband connection. After implementing communication path C and the Onclave Network Solution, the RPM interface connected to an add-on security control, Onclave Home Gateway, inside the patient home environment. Once the RPM interface was connected to the Onclave Home Gateway, patient data were transmitted to the simulated cloud environment through the Onclave Telehealth Gateway. These connections enabled the project team to implement communication path D as depicted in Figure 2-1. Details on how engineers installed and configured Onclave tools are described in section 2.2.4.1, Onclave SecureIoT. 2.1.2.3 Telehealth Platform Provider–Communication Paths C and D For communication paths C and D, a simulated cloud environment was created to represent a telehealth platform provider that supports broadband-capable biometric devices. A sample Vivify Pathways Care Team Portal was obtained to demonstrate how patient data could be transmitted via broadband communications. Practitioners should note, however, that Vivify as an entity may not support this use case. Vivify engineers facilitated deploying the Vivify Pathways Care Team Portal as representative of how a telehealth platform provider may support the communications pathway. Communication paths A and B used telehealth platform providers that were located outside the NCCoE lab, and data were transmitted via cellular communications. Communication path D required more add-on security controls to be configured in the virtual cloud environment. For this communication pathway, the representative Vivify Pathways Care Team Portal was connected to an Onclave Telehealth Gateway. This gateway accepted data transmissions from the RPM interface connected to the Onclave Home Gateway housed in the patient home environment.

Portal interaction requires unique user accounts and role-based access control. System administrators create accounts and assign roles through an administrative console. Sessions from the clinician to the hosted application use encryption to ensure data-in-transit protection. This section discusses the HDO application installation and configuration procedures. 1.

Navigate to Notes to review recorded interventions or add other clinical notes 2.2 Security Capabilities The following instruction and configuration steps depict how the NCCoE engineers and project collaborators implemented the provided cybersecurity tools to achieve the desired security capabilities identified in NIST SP 1800-30B, Section 4.4, Security Capabilities. 2.2.1 Risk Assessment Controls Risk assessment controls align with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework’s ID.RA category. For this practice guide, the Tenable.sc solution was implemented as a component in an HDO’s risk assessment program. While Tenable.sc includes a broad functionality set, the project team leveraged Tenable.sc’s vulnerability scanning and management capabilities. 2.2.1.1 Tenable.sc Tenable.sc is a vulnerability management solution. Tenable.sc provides a dashboard graphic user interface that displays the results from its vulnerability scanning and configuration scanning capabilities. Tenable.sc’s dashboard includes vulnerability scoring, enabling engineers to prioritize patching and remediation. The engineers used Tenable.sc to manage a Nessus scanner, which performed vulnerability scanning against HDO domain-hosted devices. While the Tenable.sc solution includes configuration- checking functionality, this practice guide uses the solution for vulnerability management.
